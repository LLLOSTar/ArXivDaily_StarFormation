 - **Abstract**
 One challenge with explaining how high levels of planetary debris can enrich, or "pollute", old ($\sim$3 Gyr) and very old ($\sim$10 Gyr) white dwarfs is that debris reservoirs deplete on shorter timescales, akin to the solar system's already eviscerated Main Belt and Kuiper Belt. Here, I explore how these extrasolar reservoirs can be resupplied through supernovae that propel distant ($\gtrsim 10^4$ au) dust, sand and pebbles, and potentially boulders and comets, into the inner ($\lesssim 10^2$ au) planetary system. I analytically constrain the geometry of these blast waves, and derive expressions for the probability of apt blast configurations occurring. I then derive the minimum kick magnitudes needed to generate stable, leaky and broken post-blast orbits, and prove that within this formalism, at most 23 per cent of true anomalies along an eccentric orbit could allow for resupplied planetary debris to experience repeated pericentre passages. By linking these kick magnitudes with debris sizes and relating these quantities to the local neighbourhood supernova rate, I conclude that the probabilities for ejection or resupply per supernova blast are $\approx$100 per cent for micron-sized dust and millimetre-sized pebbles and sand, and $\approx$0 per cent for asteroids larger than $\sim$10 km. In between these extremes, I expect metre-sized boulders to be resupplied at least once to very old white dwarfs over their cooling ages. The efficacy of this debris delivery mechanism is dependent on the time-varying sources and sinks in an exo-Oort cloud and how its parent white dwarf has, throughout its cooling age, traversed the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Directly imaged substellar companions with well-constrained ages and masses serve as vital empirical benchmarks for planet formation and evolution models. Potential benchmark companions can be identified from astrometric accelerations of their host stars. We use Gaia DR3 and Hipparcos astrometry to identify 166 northern hemisphere stars with astrometric accelerations consistent with a substellar companion between 0.5'' and 1''. For this accelerating sample we identify young stars using APO/ARCES spectra and TESS light curves. From spectroscopic screening of the sample, we measure ages for 24 stars with detectable amounts of lithium, place lower age limits on 135 stars with lithium non-detections, and measure ages from R'HK for 34 stars. 129 stars have TESS light curves from which we measure ages for 20 stars with rotation rates < 15 days, and we identify 3 eclipsing binaries. We present median ages and confidence intervals of age posteriors for the entire sample and discuss how the overall age distribution of our sample compares to a uniform star formation rate in the solar neighborhood. We identify 47 stars with median ages < 2 Gyr, 31 stars with median ages < 1 Gyr, and 14 stars with median ages < 0.5 Gyr, making them high-priority targets for direct imaging follow-up.
#### Detecting Land with Reflected Light Spectroscopy to Rule Out Waterworld O2 Biosignature False Positives

 - **Abstract**
 The search for life outside our solar system is at the forefront of modern astronomy, and telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) are being designed to identify biosignatures. Molecular oxygen, O2, is considered a promising indication of life, yet substantial abiotic O2 may accumulate from H2O photolysis and hydrogen escape on a lifeless, fully (100%) ocean-covered terrestrial planet when surface O2 sinks are suppressed. This so-called waterworld false positive scenario could be ruled out with land detection because exposed land precludes extremely deep oceans (~50 Earth oceans) given topographic limits set by the crushing strength of rocks. Land detection is possible because plausible geologic surfaces exhibit increasing reflectance with wavelength in the visible, whereas liquid water and ice/snow have flat or decreasing reflectance, respectively. Here, we present reflected light retrievals to demonstrate that HWO could detect land on an exo-Earth in the disk-averaged spectrum. Given a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 spectrum, Earth-like land fractions can be confidently detected with 0.3-1.1 um spectral coverage (resolution R~140 in the visible, R~7 in the UV, with Earth-like atmosphere and clouds). We emphasize the need for UV spectroscopy down to at least 0.3 um to break an O3-land degeneracy. We find that the SNR and resolution requirements in the visible/UV imply that a larger aperture (~8 m) will be necessary to ensure the observing times required for land detection are feasible for most HWO terrestrial habitable zone targets. These results strongly inform the HWO minimum requirements to corroborate possible oxygen biosignatures.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Magellan/IMACS and Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Pictor~II (Pic~II) that is located only 12 kpc from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From the IMACS spectroscopy, we identify 13 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric velocity of $326.9\pm1.1~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a velocity dispersion of $3.5_{-0.9}^{+1.1}~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a mean metallicity of $\overline{\rm [Fe/H]}=-2.99\pm0.06$, and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}<0.18$. We measure detailed elemental abundances for the brightest star, finding $\mbox{[Fe/H]} = -3.3$, high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, and no detectable neutron capture elements, similar to stars in other UFDs. However, this star has an unusually high [Sc/Fe] ratio. The dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M/L=760_{-420}^{+910}~M_{\odot}~L^{-1}_{\odot}$), size, and chemical abundances confirms that Pic~II is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. We perform detailed orbit modeling of Pic~II in a combined Milky Way (MW) and LMC potential and find that Pic~II is highly likely to be a long-term LMC satellite. Furthermore, we find that Pic II is likely still bound to the LMC today. Pic~II is the seventh LMC-associated UFD and among the most metal-poor UFDs known. We further update the morphological parameters with deeper Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry, compute the dark matter properties for dark matter indirect detection searches, verify the extremely low metallicity with narrowband CaHK imaging, and briefly discuss tidal influences of the LMC and MW.
#### Probing the peak of star formation with the stochastic background of binary black hole mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Although the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration detects many individually resolvable gravitational-wave events from binary black hole mergers, those that are too weak to be identified individually contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Unlike the standard cross-correlation search for excess correlated power, a Bayesian search method that models the background as a superposition of an unknown number of mergers enables simultaneous inference of the properties of high-redshift binary black hole populations and accelerated detection of the background. In this work, we apply this templated background search method to one day of simulated data at current LIGO Hanford-Livingston detector network sensitivity to determine whether the weakest mergers contribute information to the detection of the background and to the constraint on the merger redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that the dominant source of information for the detection of the stochastic background comes from mergers with signal-to-noise ratios just below the individual detection threshold. However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.
#### A search of periodic variable stars in the LMC by JWST photometry

 - **Abstract**
 Based on high-resolution near-infrared photometric data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) targeting the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), this study attempts to evaluate the feasibility and sensitivity limits of variable star detection in crowded stellar fields. Through light curve analysis, we identified a total of 304 periodic variable stars, including 71 EW-type eclipsing binaries, 7 EA-type eclipsing binaries, 177 rotational variables, 38 $\delta$ Scuti (DSCT) stars, and 12 RR Lyrae stars. Period--luminosity relations (PLRs) were derived for EW-type eclipsing binaries, DSCT stars, and RR Lyrae stars. The PLRs for EW-type and RR Lyrae stars are in good agreement with previous studies, while the PLR zero point for DSCT stars appears systematically fainter by approximately 0.15--0.30 mag. Our PLRs exhibit low dispersion and are minimally affected by crowding. We analyzed the capability of JWST archival data to detect low-amplitude variables and found that only stars with amplitudes greater than approximately 0.05 mag can be reliably detected. Through simulations, we quantified how increasing the number of photometric epochs improves the detectability of low-amplitude, low signal-to-noise ratio variables. Despite current limitations in observational cadence, JWST demonstrates unique advantages in detecting short-period eclipsing binaries, rotational variables, and high-amplitude pulsators. Its exceptional spatial resolution enables high-precision PLR calibrations, offering new opportunities for future studies in variable star astrophysics and extragalactic distance measurements.
