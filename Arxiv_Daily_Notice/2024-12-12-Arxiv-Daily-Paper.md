 - **Abstract**
 On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. The statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of filamentary structures identified in the SARAO (South African Radio Astronomy Observatory) MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). We extract 933 filaments across the survey area, 803 of which (~86%) are associated with extended radio structures (e.g. supernova remnants and HII regions), whilst 130 (~14%) are largely isolated. We classify filaments as thermal or non-thermal via their associated mid-infrared emission and find 77/130 (~59%) of the isolated sources are likely to be non-thermal, and are therefore excellent candidates for the first isolated, non-thermal radio filaments observed outside of the Galactic Centre (GC). Comparing the morphological properties of these non-thermal candidates to the non-thermal filaments observed towards the GC we find the GC filaments are on the whole angularly narrower and shorter than those across the SMGPS, potentially an effect of distance. The SMGPS filaments have flux densities similar to those of the GC, however the distribution of the latter extends to higher flux densities. If the SMGPS filaments were closer than the GC population, it would imply a more energetic population of cosmic ray electrons in the GC. We find the filament position angles in the SMGPS are uniformly distributed, implying that the local magnetic field traced by the filaments does not follow the large-scale Galactic field. Finally, although we have clearly shown that filaments are not unique to the GC, the GC nevertheless has the highest density of filaments in the Milky Way.
#### Accretion onto WD 2226$-$210, the central star of the Helix Nebula

 - **Abstract**
 The central star of the Helix Nebula, WD 2226$-$210 presents enigmatic hard X-ray emission and mid-IR excess. The latter has been attributed to a dusty disk or a cloud-like structure around WD 2226$-$210 formed from material of Kuiper Belt-like or comet-like objects in highly eccentric orbits. We present here a detailed analysis of multi-epoch Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of WD 2226$-$210, comparing these to previous Einstein and ROSAT data. The luminosity of the hard X-ray component of WD 2226$-$210 has remained basically constant in the decade from 1992 to 2002, with very subtle evidence for variability in timescales of hours. Under the assumption that the X-ray emission from WD 2226$-$210 is due to accretion of material, an accretion rate of $\dot{M}\approx10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is estimated. The origin of the material accreted by WD 2226$-$210 is uncertain, and can be attributed to the disk-like structure around it or to a sub-stellar donor companion. The accretion rate proposed for the continuous replenishment by bombardment of the mid-IR-emitting structure around WD 2226$-$210 cannot match that required by the X-ray emission.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we considered the optical wavelength of Gaia DR3 to analyze poorly studied three newly open star clusters namely OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244 clusters with ASTECA code. Here, we identified candidates of 227, 200, and 551 with highly probable ($P \geq 50\%$) members. Fitting King's profile within RDPs allows us to estimate inner stellar structures like core (0.190 $\le r_{\rm c}$ (pc) $\le$ 1.284) and the limiting (0.327 $\le r_{\rm cl}$ (pc) $\le 1.302$) radii. Constructing CMDs fitted with suitable log age (yr) between (log t; 6.52 - 7.05) and metallicities (Z; 0.01308-0.01413) isochrones. Therefore, the estimated photometric parameters with CMDs, reflect the heliocentric distances are 332 $\pm$ 18, 529 $\pm$ 23, and 506 $\pm$ 23 (pc) for OCSN 203, OCSN 213, and OCSN 244, respectively. Furthermore, the collective mass ($M_{\rm C}$) in solar mass units calculated with MLR as 67 $\pm$ 8.19, 91 $\pm$ 9.54, and 353 $\pm$ 18.79. Additionally, LF determined that the mean absolute magnitudes are 9.54 $\pm$ 3.09, 8.52 $\pm$ 2.92, and 7.60 $\pm$ 2.76 for these clusters, respectively. The overall mass function reflects the slopes ($\alpha$) for Salpeter within the uncertainty are ($\alpha_{OCSN203}$ = 2.41 $\pm$ 0.06), ($\alpha_{OCSN213}$ = 2.13 $\pm$ 0.07), and ($\alpha_{OCSN244}$ = 2.28 $\pm$ 0.07). The results of this study which employed a dynamical analysis over varying timescales indicate that OCSN 203 and OCSN 244 are clusters that have undergone significant relaxation, with a dynamical evolution parameter ($\tau$) that is much greater than one. In contrast, OCSN 213 exhibits characteristics of a non-relaxed cluster. A kinematic analysis of these open clusters was carried out, encompassing aspects of their apex position ($A_o,D_o$) using the AD diagrams. At the end, we found that the three OCSN clusters are young stellar disc members using dynamic orbit parameters.
#### 3D Convective Urca Process in a Simmering White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. In the early stages of carbon burning, called the simmering phase, energy released by the reactions in the core drive the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection, which may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. The convective Urca process is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to properly model the turbulent convection, an inherently 3D process. Because the neutron excess of the fluid both sets and is set by the extent of the convection zone, the realistic steady state can only be determined in simulations with real 3D mixing processes. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) and thus a low Mach number method is needed to model the flow over many convective turnovers. Using the MAESTROeX low Mach number hydrodynamic software, we present the first full star 3D simulations of the A=23 convective Urca process, spanning hundreds of convective turnover times. Our findings on the extent of mixing across the Urca shell, the characteristic velocities of the flow, the energy loss rates due to neutrino emission, and the structure of the convective boundary can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.
#### Constraining Asymmetric DM Properties by Black Hole Formation in Neutron Stars and Population III Stars

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we explore the potential for Neutron Stars (NSs) at the Galactic center and Population~III stars to constrain Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM). We demonstrate that for NSs in an environment of sufficiently high DM density ($\rhox\gtrsim10^{9}\unit{GeV/cm^3}$), the effects of both multiscatter capture and DM evaporation cannot be neglected. If a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) forms from ADM, then its low temperature and densely cored profile render evaporation from the BEC negligible, strengthening detectability of low-mass DM. Because of this, we find that the most easily observable Population III stars could be highly effective at constraining high-$\sigma$ low-$\mx$ DM, maintaining efficacy below $\mx=10^{-15}\unit{GeV}$ thanks to their far lower value of $\mx$ at which capture saturates to the geometric limit. Finally, we derive closed-form approximations for the evaporation rate of DM from arbitrary polytropic objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Continuing our initiative on advancing the calculations of planetesimal accretion in the core-accretion model, we present here the results of our recent study of the contributions of planetesimals around and beyond the orbit of Saturn. In our first two papers [ApJ, 899:45; 941:117], where our focus was on the effects of the Sun and Saturn, the initial distribution of planetesimals was limited to the regions around the accretion zone of a growing Jupiter. In this paper, we expanded that distribution to regions beyond the accretion zone of Saturn. We integrated the orbits of a large ensemble of planetesimals and studied the rate of their capture by the growing proto-Jupiter. In order to be consistent with our previous studies, we did not consider the effect of the nebular gas. Results demonstrated that the exterior planetesimals, especially those beyond 8 AU, have only slight contributions to the growth and metallicity of the growing Jupiter. The final mass and composition of this planet is mainly due to the planetesimals inside and around its accretion zone. Our study shows that although the rate of capture varies slightly by the size and composition of planetesimals, in general, the final results are independent of the size and material of these bodies. Results also pointed to a new finding: the rate of accretion follows the same trend as that of the evolution of Jupiter's envelope, with the largest accretion occurring during the envelope's collapse. We present details of our analysis and discuss the implications of their results.
#### Isolated Black Holes as Potential PeVatrons and Ultrahigh-energy Gamma-ray Sources

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of PeV cosmic rays is a long-standing mystery, and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray observations would play a crucial role in identifying it. Recently, LHAASO reported the discovery of ``dark'' gamma-ray sources that were detected above 100 TeV without any GeV--TeV gamma-ray counterparts. The origins of these dark gamma-ray sources are unknown. We propose isolated black holes (IBHs) wandering in molecular clouds as the origins of PeV cosmic rays and LHAASO dark sources. An IBH accretes surrounding dense gas, which forms a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around the IBH. Magnetic reconnection in the MAD can accelerate cosmic-ray protons up to PeV energies. Cosmic-ray protons of GeV-TeV energies fall to the IBH, whereas cosmic-ray protons at sub-PeV energies can escape from the MAD, providing PeV CRs into the interstellar medium. The sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons interact with the surrounding molecular clouds, producing TeV-PeV gamma rays without emitting GeV-TeV gamma rays. This scenario can explain the dark sources detected by LHAASO. Taking into account the IBH and molecular cloud distributions in our Galaxy, we demonstrate that IBHs can provide a significant contribution to the PeV cosmic rays observed on Earth. Future gamma-ray detectors in the southern sky and neutrino detectors would provide a concrete test to our scenario.
#### Hadronic particle acceleration in the supernova remnant SN 1006 as traced by Fermi-LAT observations

 - **Abstract**
 The supernova remnant SN 1006 is a source of high-energy particles detected at radio, X-rays, and tera-electronvolt gamma rays. It was also announced as a source of gamma rays by Fermi-LAT but only the north-east (NE) limb was detected at more than $5\sigma$ significance level. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT observation and a thorough morphological analysis above 1 GeV, we report the detection of the NE rim at the $6\sigma$ level and the south-west (SW) rim at the $5.5\sigma$ level using radio templates from the GLEAM survey. The spectral analysis performed between 100 MeV and 1 TeV allows the detection of a hard spectral index for the NE limb of $1.7 \pm 0.1 \pm 0.1$ while the emission detected in the SW is well reproduced with a steeper spectral index of $2.2 \pm 0.1 \pm 0.1$. A marginal detection (~$3\sigma$) of emission coincident with the bright north-west (NW) H$\alpha$ filament is also described with a similar spectral index of ~2.1. We successfully characterized the non-thermal multi-wavelength emission of the NE and SW limbs with a model in which inverse-Compton emission dominates in the NE while proton-proton interactions becomes significant in the SW due to the enhanced density of the medium.
#### Andromeda's tenuous veil: extensive nebular emission near (yet far from) M31

 - **Abstract**
 A large, faint nebula was unexpectedly discovered near M31 using narrowband [O III] images. Its apparent size and the lack of a clear counterpart at other wavelengths make it unique and challenging to explain. We aim to determine whether the nebula is extragalactic or located within the Milky Way. This will enable us to constrain its physical properties and assess its nature. To do so, we obtained deep narrowband [O II]3727 and H$\alpha$+[NII] observations with the JAST80 telescope at the Observatorio Astrofísico de Javalambre, as well as high-spectral-resolution spectroscopy at four locations within the region of interest using MEGARA at the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We found extended [O II] emission along two near-parallel strands to the [O III], offset by six arcmin. The nebular spectra reveals up to 6 emission lines from [O III]4959,5007, H$\beta$, [N II]6583, and [S II]6716,6731. Their receding velocities are above $-$40 km s$^{-1}$, far from the systemic velocity of M31 ($-$300 km s$^{-1}$). The fluxes and velocities are consistent for the same lines across different regions of the nebula. The nebular properties suggest a location within the Milky Way rather than being physically associated with M31. The most likely scenario is a resolved ionization structure in a Galactic nebula with a separation between [O II] and [O III] of a few parsecs. The observed receding velocities would be unprecedented for an object physically linked to M31 but are common for nearby gas filaments. Their consistency across the nebula would also be unusual if it were larger than a kiloparsec. The analysis of the emission-line ratios, line widths, and morphology suggests the possibility of it being an interstellar gas filament with an additional source of ionization to explain the [O III] emission. However, the complex properties of this object call for further observations to confirm its nature.
#### Observational studies on S-bearing molecules in massive star forming regions

 Aims. We present observational results of H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3, SiO 4-3, HC$_{3}$N 19-18 and C$^{18}$O 1-0 toward a sample of 51 late-stage massive star-forming regions, to study relationships among H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS, HCS$^{+}$ and SiO in hot cores. Chemical connections of these S-bearing molecules are discussed based on the relations between relative abundances in sources. Results. H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3 and HC$_{3}$N 19-18 were detected in 50 of the 51 sources, while SiO 4-3 was detected in 46 sources. C$^{18}$O 1-0 was detected in all sources. The Pearson correlation coefficients between H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^+$ normalized by H$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$S are 0.94 and 0.87, respectively, and a tight linear relationship is found between them with slope of 1.00 and 1.09, while they are 0.77 and 0.98 between H$_2$S and H$_2$CS, respectively, and 0.76 and 0.97 between H$_2$S and HCS$^+$. The values of full width at half maxima (FWHM) of them in each source are similar to each other, which indicate that they can trace similar regions. Comparing the observed abundance with model results, there is one possible time (2-3$\times$10$^{5}$ yr) for each source in the model. The abundances of these molecules increase with the increment of SiO abundance in these sources, which implies that shock chemistry may be important for them. Conclusions. Close abundance relation of H$_2$S, H$_2$CS and HCS$^+$ molecules and similar line widths in observational results indicate that these three molecules could be chemically linked, with HCS$^+$ and H$_2$CS the most correlated. The comparison of the observational results with chemical models shows that the abundances can be reproduced for almost all the sources at a specific time. The observational results, including abundances in these sources need to be considered in further modeling H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^{+}$ in hot cores with shock chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Connecting numerical simulations to observations is essential to understanding the physics of galactic winds. Our Galaxy hosts a large-scale, multi-phase nuclear wind, whose dense gas has been detected using HI and molecular line observations. In this paper, we summarise our recent numerical work devoted to producing synthetic HI observables and measuring the properties of HI gas in galactic wind simulations. We discuss the evolution of radiative cloud systems embedded in star formation-driven galactic winds. Our shock-multicloud models show that multicloud gas streams are able to produce significant fractions of HI gas via recondensation. Our wind-cloud models show that magnetic fields have significant effects on the morphology and spectral signatures of HI gas. Cooling-driven recondensation, hydrodynamic shielding, and magnetic draping promote the survival of dense gas and the development of filamentary outflows. The orientation of magnetic fields also has an effect on synthetic observables, particularly on HI spectral lines. Transverse magnetic fields produce broader spectral lines of HI than aligned magnetic fields. Our models and analysis suggest that the fast-moving HI gas observed in the nuclear wind of our Galaxy may arise from multi-phase flows via recondensation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation" by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast, dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent validation for future detection schemes.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae (SNe) come in various flavors and are classified into different types based on emission and absorption lines in their spectra. SN candidates are now abundant with the advent of large systematic dynamic sky surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), however, the identification bottleneck lies in their spectroscopic confirmation and classification. Fully robotic telescopes with dedicated spectrographs optimized for SN follow-up have eased the burden of data acquisition. However, the task of classifying the spectra still largely rests with the astronomers. Automating this classification step reduces human effort, and can make the SN type available sooner to the public. For this purpose, we have developed a deep-learning based program for classifying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with ultra-low resolution spectra obtained with the SED-Machine IFU spectrograph on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. The program consists of hierarchical classification task layers, with each layer composed of multiple binary classifiers which are run in parallel to produce a reliable classification. The binary classifiers utilize RNN and CNN architecture and are designed to take multiple inputs, to supplement spectra with g- and r-band photometry from ZTF. On non-host-contaminated and good quality SEDM spectra ("gold" test set), CCSNscore is ~94% accurate (correct classifications) in distinguishing between hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) CCSNe. With the help of light curve input, CCSNscore classifies ~83% of the gold set with high confidence (score >= 0.8 and score-error < 0.05), with ~98% accuracy.
