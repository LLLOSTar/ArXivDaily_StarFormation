 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are unique probes of extragalactic ionized baryonic structure as each signal, through its burst properties, holds information about the ionized matter it encounters along its sightline. FRB 20200723B is a burst with a scattering timescale of $\tau_\mathrm{400\,MHz} >$1 second at 400 MHz and a dispersion measure of DM $\sim$ 244 pc cm$^{-3}$. Observed across the entire CHIME/FRB frequency band, it is the single-component burst with the largest scattering timescale yet observed by CHIME/FRB. The combination of its high scattering timescale and relatively low dispersion measure present an uncommon opportunity to use FRB 20200723B to explore the properties of the cosmic web it traversed. With an $\sim$arcminute-scale localization region, we find the most likely host galaxy is NGC 4602 (with PATH probability $P(O|x)=0.985$), which resides $\sim$30 Mpc away within a sheet filamentary structure on the outskirts of the Virgo Cluster. We place an upper limit on the average free electron density of this filamentary structure of $\langle n_e \rangle < 4.6^{+9.6}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$, broadly consistent with expectations from cosmological simulations. We investigate whether the source of scattering lies within the same galaxy as the FRB, or at a farther distance from an intervening structure along the line of sight. Comparing with Milky Way pulsar observations, we suggest the scattering may originate from within the host galaxy of FRB 20200723B.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST is revolutionising the study of temperate sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detection of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. The retrieved abundances of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ and non-detection of NH$_3$ and CO in K2-18 b are consistent with prior predictions of photochemical models for a Hycean world with a habitable ocean. However, recent photochemical modeling raised the prospect that the observed abundances may be explained by a mini-Neptune scenario instead. In this study, we explore these scenarios using independent photochemical modeling with K2-18 b as a case study. We find the previous results to be sensitive to a range of model assumptions, such as the photochemical cross sections, incident stellar spectrum, surface pressure, UV albedo, and metallicity, significantly affecting the resulting abundances. We explore a wide model space to investigate scenarios that are compatible with the retrieved molecular abundances for K2-18 b. Our analysis shows that the previously favoured mini-Neptune scenario is not compatible with most of the retrieved abundances, while the Hycean scenarios, both inhabited and uninhabited, provide better agreement. An uninhabited Hycean scenario explains most of the abundance constraints, except CH$_4$ which is generally underabundant but dependent on the model assumptions. The inhabited Hycean scenario is compatible with all the abundances if the observed CH$_4$ is assumed to be predominantly biogenic. Our results underscore the importance of systematic photochemical modeling and accurate interpretation of chemical abundance constraints for candidate Hycean worlds.

 - **Abstract**
 The rate and mechanism of mass loss of red supergiants (RSGs) remain poorly understood, especially at low metallicities. Motivated by the new empirical prescription by Yang et al. 2023, based on the largest and most complete sample in the Small Magellanic Cloud, we investigate the impact of different popular and recent RSG mass-loss prescriptions that span a range of RSG mass-loss rates on the evolution and observable properties of single massive stars. Our results show that higher mass-loss rates result in earlier envelope stripping and shorter RSG lifetimes, particularly for the more luminous stars, leading to a steeper luminosity function and predicting hotter final positions for the SN progenitors. None of the considered mass-loss prescriptions is fully consistent with all observational constraints, highlighting ongoing uncertainties in deriving and modeling RSGs mass loss. The mass-loss rates suggested by Kee et al. predict rapid envelope stripping, inconsistent with the observed population of luminous RSGs and SN progenitor detections, while the models implementing the commonly used de Jager et al. and the recent Beasor et al. prescriptions overestimate the number of luminous RSGs. While the increased mass-loss rates for luminous RSGs predicted by Yang et al. lead to better agreement with the observed RSG luminosity function, naturally reproducing the updated Humphreys-Davidson limit, they also produce luminous yellow supergiant progenitors not detected in nearby supernovae. We also estimate that binary interactions tend to slightly increase the formation of luminous RSGs due to mass accretion or merging. Our study examines the impact of RSG mass loss during the late stages of massive stars, highlighting the significance of using comprehensive observational data, exploring the uncertainties involved, and considering the effects of binary-induced or episodic mass loss.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of populations of binary stars within massive cluster-forming regions. We simulate the formation of young massive star clusters within giant molecular clouds with masses ranging from 2 x 10$^{4}$ to 3.2 x 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the AMUSE framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries' orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high and there are frequent mergers between sub-clusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 Between 2017 and 2024, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory has observed several white-light solar flares. Notably, for the X9.3 flare of September 6, 2017, HMI spectro-polarimetric observations reveal one or more locations within the umbra of the associated active region where the Fe I 6173 Å line goes into full emission, indicating significant heating of the photosphere and lower chromosphere. For these flares, we performed a spectro-polarimetric analysis at the aforementioned locations using HMI 90s cadence Stokes data. At the Fe I emission locations, line-core emission is observed to last for a single 90 s frame and is either concurrent with or followed by increases in the line continuum intensity lasting 90 to 180 seconds. This is followed by a smooth decay to pre-flare conditions over the next three to twenty minutes. For most locations, permanent changes to the Stokes Q, U, and/or V profiles were observed, indicating long-lasting non-transient changes to the photospheric magnetic field. These emissions coincided with local maxima in hard X-ray emission observed by the Konus instrument onboard the Wind spacecraft, as well as local maxima in the time derivative of soft X-ray emission observed by GOES satellites. Comparison of the Fe I 6173 Å line profile synthesis for the ad-hoc heating of the initial empirical VAL-S umbra model and quiescent Sun (VAL-C-like) model indicates that the Fe I 6173 Å line emission in the white-light flare kernels could be explained by the strong heating of initially cool photospheric regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) has successfully measured cosmic rays for over a decade now. With its dense core of antenna fields in the Netherlands, it is an ideal tool for studying the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $10^{16}$ eV to $10^{18.5}$ eV range. Every air shower is measured with a small particle detector array and hundreds of antennas, which sets LOFAR apart from other air shower arrays. We present our current achievements and progress in reconstruction, interpolation, and software development during the final phases of measurement of LOFAR 1.0, before the LOFAR array gets a significant upgrade, including also plans for the final data release and refined analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in interstellar ices is key to constrain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM), since it is the only ice S-bearing molecule securely detected thus far. Two general pathways for OCS formation have been proposed: sulfurization of CO (CO+S) and oxidation of CS (CS+O), but their relative contribution in interstellar ices remains unconstrained. We have evaluated the contribution of both pathways to OCS formation upon energetic processing in isotopically-labeled CO2:CS2 and CO:CS2 ice samples at 7-50 K. Our results indicated that formation of OCS through the CS+O pathway was more favorable than through the CO+S pathway, as previously suggested by theoretical calculations. In addition, its relative contribution increased at higher temperatures. Therefore, this pathway could play a role in the ice formation of OCS, especially in warm regions where CO is expected to be preferentially in the gas phase. At the same time, we have explored the chemistry of CS2-bearing, CO2-, CO-, and also H2O-rich ices, that could be relevant to the sulfur interstellar chemistry. We observed formation of a variety of S-bearing products in addition to OCS, including SO2, C3S2, and S2. However, a significant fraction of sulfur was not detected at the end of the experiments, and could be locked in long, undetectable sulfur allotropes, one of the potential carriers of the missing sulfur in the dense ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown Dwarfs (BDs) are crucial objects in our understanding of both star and planet formation. However, there is still an unconcluded debate about which is the dominant formation mechanism of these objects. For this, it is mandatory to study BDs in their earliest evolutionary stages (what we call pre- and proto-BDs), comparable to the `pre-stellar' and `Class 0/I' stages well characterized for the formation of low-mass stars. In this review, the recent efforts aimed at searching, identifying and characterising pre- and proto-BD candidates in nearby star-forming regions are presented, and revised requirements for an object to be a promising proto-BD or pre-BD candidate are provided, based on a new, unexplored so far, relation between the internal luminosity and the accreted mass. By applying these requirements, a list of 67 promising proto-BD candidates is presented, along with a compilation of possible pre-BDs from the literature. Updated correlations of protostellar properties such as mass infall rate or outflow momentum rate with bolometric luminosity are provided down to the low-mass BD regime, where no significant deviations are apparent. Furthermore, the number of proto-BD candidates in different clouds of the Solar Neighborhood seem to follow the known relations of number of protostars with cloud properties. In addition, proto(star-to-BD) ratios for the different clouds are also explored, unveiling a particular underproduction of low-mass proto-BD candidates in Ophiuchus compared to Lupus and Taurus. Possible explanations for this behavior are discussed, including heating of the Ophiuchus cloud by the nearby OB stars. The overall results of this work tend to favor a star-like process for BD formation down to the planetary boundary, of about 10 Mjup, below which other mechanisms might be at work.

 - **Abstract**
 [SHORTENED VERSION] Observations of radio emission from young core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) allow one to study the history of the pre-supernova stellar wind, trace the density structure of the ejected material, and probe the magnetohydrodynamics that describe the interaction between the two, as the forward shock expands into the circumstellar medium. The radio shell of supernova SN1993J has been observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) for ~20 years, giving one of the most complete pictures of the evolution of a CCSN shock. However, different results about the expansion curve and properties of the radio-emitting structure have been reported by different authors, likely due to systematics in the data calibration and/or model assumptions made by each team. We aim to perform an analysis of the complete set of VLBI observations of SN1993J that accounts for different instrumental and source-intrinsic effects, by exploring the posterior probability distribution of a complete data model, using Markov chains. Our model accounts for antenna calibration effects, as well as different kinds of radio-emission structures for the supernova. The posterior parameter distributions strongly favor a spherical shell-like radio structure with a nonuniform radial intensity profile, with a broad brightness distribution that peaks close to or just above the region where the contact discontinuity is expected to be located. There is clear evidence of a relative widening of the shell width beyond day 2600-3300 after the explosion, due to an increased deceleration of the inner shell boundary. These results suggest a scenario in which the magnetic field is amplified mainly by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which emanates from the contact discontinuity. Furthermore, the reverse shock enters a region of the ejecta at around 3000 days, where the density distribution is substantially flatter.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional simulations usually fail to cover the entire dynamical common-envelope phase of gravitational wave progenitor systems due to the vast range of spatial and temporal scales involved. We investigated the common-envelope interactions of a $10\,M_\odot$ red supergiant primary star with a black hole and a neutron star companion, respectively, until full envelope ejection (${\gtrsim}\,97 \,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope mass). We find that the dynamical plunge-in of the systems determines largely the orbital separations of the core binary system, while the envelope ejection by recombination acts only at later stages of the evolution and fails to harden the core binaries down to orbital frequencies where they qualify as progenitors of gravitational-wave-emitting double-compact object mergers. As opposed to the conventional picture of a spherically symmetric envelope ejection, our simulations show a new mechanism: The rapid plunge-in of the companion transforms the spherical morphology of the giant primary star into a disk-like structure. During this process, magnetic fields are amplified, and the subsequent transport of material through the disk around the core binary system drives a fast jet-like outflow in the polar directions. While most of the envelope material is lost through a recombination-driven wind from the outer edge of the disk, about $7\,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope leaves the system via the magnetically driven outflows. We further explored the potential evolutionary pathways of the post-common-envelope systems given the expected remaining lifetime of the primary core ($2.97\,M_\odot$) until core collapse ($6{\times}10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}$), most likely forming a neutron star. We find that the interaction of the core binary system with the circumbinary disk increases the likelihood of giving rise to a double-neutron star merger. (abridged)
#### A dichotomy in the 1-24 GHz parsec-scale radio spectra of radio-quiet quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the pc-scale radio spectra of a representative sample of 13 Palomar-Green (PG) radio-quiet quasars (RQQ), based on our new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 8.4 and 23.6 GHz and our earlier VLBA studies at 1.5 and 5.0 GHz. The radio core emission generally exhibits a flat spectrum at 1.5-5.0 GHz, which indicates a compact optically thick synchrotron source with a size extending down to at least the broad-line region (BLR) radius R_BLR ~0.01-0.1 pc. In comparison, the 8.4-23.6 GHz spectral slope remains flat in four objects indicating the inner radius of the radio source R_in < 0.1 R_BLR, and becomes steep in another four objects indicating R_in ~0.5 R_BLR. The flat 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be associated with a continuous flow, starting at the accretion disk corona and expanding outwards. The steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be produced by an interaction of an AGN-driven wind with the BLR gas or a low-power jet extending to the BLR scale. The Eddington ratio L/L_Edd in seven of the eight objects with a flat or steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope is low (< 0.3). In contrast, the L/L_Edd in four of the remaining five objects, which the 8.4-23.6 GHz slope can not be significantly constrained, is high (> 0.3), suggesting a radiation pressure driven wind. Future sub-millimeter observations can further constrain the inward radial extent of the radio emission down to the coronal scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray emission is observed coincident in position to the evolved, composite supernova remnant (SNR) B0453-685. Prior multi-wavelength investigations of the region indicate that the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the SNR is the most likely origin for the observed gamma-rays, with a possible pulsar contribution that becomes significant at energies below E ~ 5GeV. Constraints on the PWN hard X-ray spectrum are important for the most accurate broadband representation of PWN emission and determining the presence of a gamma-ray pulsar component. The results of Parkes radio and NuSTAR X-ray observations are presented on PWN B0453-685. We perform a search for the central pulsar in the new Parkes radio data, finding an upper limit of 12uJy. A pulsation search in the new NuSTAR observation additionally provides a 3sigma upper-limit on the hard X-ray pulsed fraction of 56%. The PWN is best characterized with a photon index Gamma_X = 1.91 +\- 0.20 in the 3-78keV NuSTAR data and the results are incorporated into existing broadband models. Lastly, we characterize a serendipitous source detected by Chandra and NuSTAR that is considered a new high mass X-ray binary candidate.

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-epoch optical spectropolarimetric and imaging polarimetric observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf discovered in M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc. The first imaging polarimetric observations were taken +2.33 days (60085.08 MJD) after the explosion, while the last imaging polarimetric data points (+73.19 and +76.19 days) were acquired after the fall from the light curve plateau. At +2.33 days there is strong evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction in the spectra and the light curve. A significant level of polarization $P_r = 0.88\pm 0.06 \% $ seen during this phase indicates that this CSM is aspherical. We find that the polarization evolves with time toward the interstellar polarization level ($0.35\%$) during the photospheric phase, which suggests that the recombination photosphere is spherically symmetric. There is a jump in polarization ($P_r =0.65 \pm 0.08 \% $) at +73.19 days when the light curve falls from the plateau. This is a phase where polarimetric data is sensitive to non-spherical inner ejecta or a decrease in optical depth into the single scattering regime. We also present spectropolarimetric data that reveal line (de)polarization during most of the observed epochs. In addition, at +14.50 days we see an "inverse P Cygn" profile in the H and He line polarization, which clearly indicates the presence of asymmetrically distributed material overlying the photosphere. The overall temporal evolution of polarization is typical for Type II SNe, but the high level of polarization during the rising phase has only been observed in SN 2023ixf.
