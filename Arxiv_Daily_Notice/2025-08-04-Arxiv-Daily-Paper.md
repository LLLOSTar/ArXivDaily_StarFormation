#### Discovery of an $\rm[Fe/H] \sim -4.8$ Star in $Gaia$ XP Spectra

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the discovery of GDR3_526285 ($Gaia$ DR3 Source ID 5262850721755411072), a star with $\rm[Fe/H] = -4.82 \pm 0.25$ and one of the lowest metal ($\text{atomic number} > 2$) mass fractions ever found ($Z_{\rm GDR3\_526585} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$). We first identified it as an ultra metal-poor (UMP; $\rm[Fe/H] < -4$) red giant-branch (RGB) star candidate in the $Gaia$ BP/RP (XP) spectro-photometric catalog ($Gaia$ $G$ magnitude $\approx$15). A combination of multi-band photometry and high-resolution spectroscopic analysis under local thermodynamic equilibrium confirmed the status of GDR3_526285 as a distant ($\approx$24 kpc from the Sun) RGB star ($T_{\rm eff} = 4596\,{\rm K}$, $\log g = 0.88$) in the Milky Way's outer halo. We obtain only an upper limit for the carbon abundance of $\rm[C/H] < -4.32$, resulting in $\rm[C/Fe] < +0.50$. A correction for the evolutionary carbon depletion ($\Delta \rm[C/Fe] = +0.68$) brings the nominal carbon-to-iron ratio upper limit to $\rm[C/Fe]_{\rm cor} < +1.18$. Given its extraordinarily low [C/H], GDR3_526285 likely formed from gas cooled via dust grains rather than fine structure line cooling. The kinematics of GDR3_526285 suggests that this star was either dynamically perturbed by the infall of the Magellanic system or was formerly a member of the Magellanic Clouds and was later stripped by the Milky Way. Our results showcase the potential of an all-sky search for low-metallicity targets with $Gaia$ XP and confirm that the methodology described here is an useful "treasure map" for finding additional UMP stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of GRB 240825A, a bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Fermi and Swift, with a prompt duration ($T_{\rm 90}$ ~ 4 sec in 50-300 keV) near the boundary separating short and long GRBs, prompting a detailed investigation into its classification and progenitor. Using classical prompt metrics (duration, minimum variability timescale (MVT), lag, and spectral hardness) and modern classification techniques (machine-learning (ML) based t-SNE, support vector machine, energy-hardness-duration, and $\epsilon \equiv E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso},52} / E_{p,z,2}^{5/3}$), we find GRB 240825A exhibits hybrid characteristics. The short MVT (13.830 $\pm$ 1.574 ms), rest-frame duration, and ML-based classification indicate a merger-like or ambiguous nature, while its energetics and position on the Amati relation favor a collapsar origin. We conducted deep optical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an associated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC and 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected down to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r > 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a redshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy. Host galaxy SED modeling with Prospector indicates a massive, dusty, and star-forming galaxy-typical of collapsar GRB hosts, though with low sSFR and large offset. We compare these findings with hybrid events like GRB 211211A, GRB 230307A, GRB 200826A, including SNe-GRBs, and conclude that GRB 240825A likely originated from a massive star collapse, with the associated supernova obscured by a dusty host environment or low luminosity SN with absolute magnitude M$_{V}$ fainter than -18.0. This study emphasizes the need for multiwavelength follow-up and a multi-layered classification to determine GRB progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of WASP-107b suggest a metal-rich and carbon-deprived atmosphere with an extremely hot interior based on detections of SO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, and CH$_4$. In this paper, we aim to determine the reliability of a 1D radiative-convective photochemical-equilibrium (1D-RCPE) retrieval method in inferring atmospheric properties of WASP-107b. Our grid of radiative-convective balanced pressure-temperature profiles and 1D photochemical equilibrated models covers a range of metallicities (Z), carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O), intrinsic temperatures (T$_{int}$), and eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{zz}$). We obtain good fits with our 1D-RCPE retrievals based on a few molecular features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, SO$_2$, and CH$_4$, but find no substantial contribution of NH$_3$. We find that the degeneracy between metallicity, cloud pressure, and a model offset is broken by the presence of strong SO$_2$ features, confirming that SO$_2$ is a robust metallicity indicator. We systematically retrieve sub-solar C/O based on the relative amplitude of a strong CO$_2$ feature with respect to the broad band of H$_2$O, which is sensitive to a wavelength-dependent scattering slope. We find that high-altitude clouds obscure the CH$_4$-rich layers, preventing the retrievals from constraining T$_{int}$, but that higher values of K$_{zz}$ can transport material above the cloud deck, allowing a fit of the CH$_4$ feature. However, T$_{int}$ and K$_{zz}$ can vary substantially between retrievals depending on the adopted cloud parametrization. We conclude that the 1D-RCPE retrieval method can provide useful insights if the underlying grid of forward models is well understood. We find that WASP-107b's atmosphere is enriched in metals (3 to 5 times solar) and carbon-deprived (C/O <= 0.20). However, we lack robust constraints on the intrinsic temperature and vertical mixing strength.

 - **Abstract**
 With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Subaru-Asahi StarCam is a high-sensitivity live-streaming camera for meteor observation, installed on the dome of the Subaru Telescope at the summit area of Maunakea, Hawai'i. Although it was originally intended to share the Maunakea night sky with the public, including the local Hawai'i community, the system quickly demonstrated its potential for scientific research, owing to its highly sensitive video capabilities and the exceptional fraction of clear nights at the site. The core of the StarCam system features a Sony FX3 camera body paired with an F1.4 wide-angle lens, offering a field of view of 70 deg by 40 deg. Leveraging a state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and a bright lens, the system is capable of capturing stars as faint as magnitude 8 in real-time, with an effective frame rate of 15--30 fps. Live streaming via YouTube began in April 2021, and the feed is constantly monitored by more than a hundred viewers at any given nighttime. This has enabled the camera to be used not only for observing regular meteor showers but also for monitoring scientifically important phenomena such as fireballs or unexpected meteor outbursts. Notable scientific achievements include: 1) Detection of the new Arid meteor shower in 2021, 2) Identification of a sub-peak activity in the Gamma-Perseid meteor shower (2021), 3) Detection of the 2022 Tau-Herculid meteor shower outburst, 4) Confirmation of the activity of the Andromedid meteor shower (2021), and 5) Multiple detections of meteor cluster phenomena. We discuss the potential and the future scope of StarCam as an open-access, real-time data platform for citizen science in meteor observations.

 - **Abstract**
 It is generally believed that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from the core collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars and at least some of them are powered by hyper-accreting black holes. However, definite proofs about the progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed in the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signature with periodic frequency $\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow phase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of a relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central engine. The energy injection signature from the \textbf{late} X-ray observations (from $5\times 10^2s\sim 1\times10^4s$) is consistent with the precession hypothesis. The prompt $\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any QPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early afterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion processess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope structure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time accretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of the black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar model. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation channel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the orbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the collapsing star.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae drive nucleosynthesis under extreme thermodynamic conditions, and complex mechanisms are at work prompting the transport of heavy elements from deep stellar interiors into outer layers. We present spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of Cassiopeia A's (Cas A) northeastern (NE) jet using the archival 1 Ms Chandra/ACIS observations, and focusing on three fingers of the jet. We report the highest Cr/Fe mass ratio (Cr/Fe $\sim0.14$) ever observed in Cas A, localized in a compact region within the southernmost finger in the NE jet. Comparisons with nucleosynthesis models indicate that the NE jet originated approximately at the boundary separating the complete Si burning layer from the incomplete Si-burning layer. We also find that mixing from different layers is needed to explain the chemical composition of the three fingers in the NE jet. We also detect significant differences in the physical and chemical properties among the three fingers analyzed of the NE jet. In particular, we find that, unlike the other two, the southernmost finger originated from a slightly more peripheral region of the explosion. Moreover, while the northern and central fingers lie almost in the plane of the sky, the southernmost finger is moving in a different direction, showing a velocity along the line of sight of $\sim2100$ km s$^{-1}$ towards the observer, with a tilt angle of $\sim16$\textdegree. These findings highlight the NE jet's role in ejecting material from the deepest explosive burning layers, providing new insights into the asymmetries originating in the inner layers of core-collapse supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The substellar initial mass function (IMF) and the formation mechanisms of brown dwarfs (BDs) remain key open questions in star formation theory. IMF characterization in a large number of star-forming regions (SFRs) is essential for constraining these processes. We aim to identify and spectroscopically confirm very low-mass members of the Corona Australis (CrA) SFR to refine its substellar census, determine its low-mass IMF, and compare it to other clusters. Using deep I-band photometry from SuprimeCam/Subaru and data from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, we identified low-mass BD candidates in CrA. We subsequently obtained NIR spectra of 173 of these candidates with KMOS/VLT, as well as optical spectra for 8 kinematic candidate members using FLOYDS/LCO. The kinematic candidates are confirmed as low-mass stellar members with spectral types M1 to M5. In contrast, all 173 BD candidates observed with KMOS are identified as contaminants. Although the follow-up yielded no new substellar members, it places strong constraints on the number of undetected substellar objects in the region. Combined with literature data, this enables us to derive the substellar IMF, which is consistent with a single power-law slope of alpha = 0.95+-0.06 in the range 0.01-1 MSun or alpha = 0.33+-0.19 in the range 0.01-0.1 MSun. The star-to-BD ratio in CrA is about 2. We also provide updated IMFs and star-to-BD ratios for Lupus3 and ChaI from the SONYC survey, reflecting revised distances from Gaia. Finally, we estimate surface densities and median FUV fluxes for 6 SFRs and clusters and compare their substellar populations as a function of environmental properties. The IMF and star-to-BD ratio show no clear dependence on stellar density or ionizing flux from the massive stars. A combined effect - where one factor enhances and the other suppresses BD formation - also appears unlikely. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth's earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surround the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10000 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surprising the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron's incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth's basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity , to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth's basal magma ocean over time.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite many attempts, the origin of UV emission line and continuum in contact binary stars remains unclear. We present a substantial UV spectroscopic analysis of VW Cephei, a late-type contact binary system, using 46 low-resolution spectra from the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in the wavelength range 1150-1978 Å. By modelling continuum and emissions lines in individual spectra, we report the significant detection of OIII] (1660 and 1666 Å) and SiIV (1393 and 1402 Å) line complexes. We observe that UV fluxes for both continuum and emission lines like CIV, OIII], CII and SiIV vary significantly (fractional rms variability up to 45%) from hours to years. In addition, line widths also change by hundreds of kilometres/sec. The UV flux variabilities observed in the continuum bands and line emissions are uncorrelated. However, most of the flux values follow the binary orbital period observed from optical data. Our analysis indicates that, while the variation in continuum flux may be attributed to a heated photosphere, the line width measurements indicate that the emission lines are likely formed in the dynamical clouds associated with Roche lobe overflow. We estimate the mass transfer rate of $ \dot{M} = (0.82 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-7} \ M_{\odot} {yr^{-1}}$ from UV line fluxes, which is in good agreement with optical studies.
