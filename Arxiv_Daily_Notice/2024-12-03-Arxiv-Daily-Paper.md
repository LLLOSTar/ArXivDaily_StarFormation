 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers have found more than a dozen planets transiting 10-40 million year old stars, but even younger transiting planets have remained elusive. A possible reason for the lack of such discoveries is that newly formed planets are not yet in a configuration that would be recognized as a transiting planet or cannot exhibit transits because our view is blocked by a protoplanetary disk. However, we now know that many outer disks are warped; provided the inner disk is depleted, transiting planets may thus be visible. Here we report the observations of the transiting planet IRAS 04125+2902 b orbiting a 3 Myr, 0.7 M$_\odot$, pre-main sequence star in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. IRAS 04125+2902 hosts a nearly face-on (i $\sim$ 30$^\circ$) transitional disk and a wide binary companion. The planet has a period of 8.83 days, a radius of 10.9 R$_\oplus$ (0.97R$_J$), and a 95%-confidence upper limit on its mass of 90M$_\oplus$ (0.3M$_J$) from radial velocity measurements, making it a possible precursor of the super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that are commonly found around main-sequence stars. The rotational broadening of the star and the orbit of the wide (4", 635 AU) companion are both consistent with edge-on orientations. Thus, all components of the system appear to be aligned except the outer disk; the origin of this misalignment is unclear. Given the rare set of circumstances required to detect a transiting planet at ages when the disk is still present, IRAS 04125+2902 b likely provides a unique window into sub-Neptunes immediately following formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent structure models of Jupiter suggest the existence of an extended region in the deep interior with a high heavy element abundance, referred to as a dilute core. This finding has led to increased interest in modelling the formation and evolution processes with the goal of understanding how and under what circumstances such a structure is formed and retained, to in turn better understand the relation between atmospheric and bulk metallicity. We modelled the evolution of giant planets, varying various parameters relevant for the convective mixing process, such as the mixing length parameter and the size of the mesh, and parameters related to the general evolution, such as the orbital distance and the initial luminosity. We in particular studied hot Jupiters and find that the effect of bloating on the mixing process is small but can in some cases inhibit convective mixing by lowering the intrinsic luminosity for a given entropy. Semi-convection can significantly lower the extent of a dilute core if it is strong enough. We find that dilute cores are unable to persist for initial luminosities much higher than 3 x 1e3 LJ for a Jupiter-like planet for the initial heavy element profiles we studied. From this we conclude that, based on our model, it is unlikely that a large number of giant planets retain a dilute core throughout their evolution, although this is dependent on the assumptions and limitations of our method. Future work should focus on improving the link between formation and evolution models so that the mixing process is accurately modelled throughout a planet's lifetime and on improving the understanding of how to model convection near radiative-convective boundaries.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past, researchers have mostly relied on single-resolution images from individual telescopes to detect gravitational lenses. We propose a search for galaxy-scale lenses that, for the first time, combines high-resolution single-band images (in our case the Hubble Space Telescope, HST) with lower-resolution multi-band images (in our case Legacy survey, LS) using machine learning. This methodology aims to simulate the operational strategies that will be employed by future missions, such as combining the images of Euclid and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). To compensate for the scarcity of lensed galaxy images for network training, we have generated mock lenses by superimposing arc features onto HST images, saved the lens parameters, and replicated the lens system in the LS images. We test four architectures based on ResNet-18: (1) using single-band HST images, (2) using three bands of LS images, (3) stacking these images after interpolating the LS images to HST pixel scale for simultaneous processing, and (4) merging a ResNet branch of HST with a ResNet branch of LS before the fully connected layer. We compare these architecture performances by creating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each model and comparing their output scores. At a false-positive rate of $10^{-4}$, the true-positive rate is $\sim$0.41, $\sim$0.45, $\sim$0.51 and $\sim$0.55, for HST, LS, stacked images and merged branches, respectively. Our results demonstrate that models integrating images from both the HST and LS significantly enhance the detection of galaxy-scale lenses compared to models relying on data from a single instrument. These results show the potential benefits of using both Euclid and LSST images, as wide-field imaging surveys are expected to discover approximately 100,000 lenses.
#### KIC 4150611: A quadruply eclipsing heptuple star system with a g-mode period-spacing pattern Asteroseismic modelling of the g-mode period-spacing pattern

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we aim to estimate the stellar parameters of the primary (Aa) by performing asteroseismic analysis on its period-spacing pattern. We use the C-3PO neural network to perform asteroseismic modelling of the g-mode period-spacing pattern of Aa, discussing the interplay of this information with external constraints from spectroscopy ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log(g)$) and eclipse modelling ($R$). To estimate the level of uncertainty due to different frequency extraction and pattern identification processes, we consider four different variations on the period-spacing patterns. To better understand the correlations between and the uncertainty structure of our parameter estimates, we also employed a classical, parameter-based MCMC grid search on four different stellar grids. The best-fitting, externally constrained model to the period-spacing pattern arrives at estimates of the stellar properties for Aa of: $M=1.51 \pm 0.05 M_\odot$, $X_c =0.43 \pm 0.04$, $R=1.66 \pm 0.1 R_\odot$, $f_{\rm ov}=0.010$, $\Omega_c=1.58 \pm 0.01$ d$^{-1}$ with rigid rotation to within the measurement errors, $\log(T_{\rm eff})=3.856 \pm 0.008$ dex, $\log(g)=4.18 \pm 0.04$ dex, and $\log(L)=0.809 \pm 0.005$ dex, which agree well with previous measurements from eclipse modelling, spectroscopy, and the Gaia DR3 luminosity. We find that the near-core properties of the best-fitting asteroseismic models are consistent with external constraints from eclipse modelling and spectroscopy. Aa appears to be a typical example of a $\gamma$ Dor star, fitting well within existing populations. We find that Aa is quasi-rigidly rotating to within the uncertainties, and note that the asteroseismic age estimate for Aa (1100 $\pm$ 100 Myr) is considerably older than the young (35 Myr) age implied by previous isochrone fits to the B binary in the literature. Our MCMC parameter-based grid-search agrees well with our pattern-modelling approach.

 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamic of relativistic jets in the inner parsec regions is deeply affected by the nature of the magnetic fields. The level of magnetization of the plasma, as well as the geometry of these fields on compact scales, have not yet been fully constrained. In this paper we employ multi-frequency and multi-epoch very long baseline interferometry observations of the nearby radio galaxy NGC 315. We aim to derive insights into the magnetic field properties on sub-parsec and parsec scales by examining observational signatures such as the spectral index, synchrotron turnover frequency, and brightness temperature profiles. This analysis is performed by considering the properties of the jet acceleration and collimation zone, which can be probed thanks to the source vicinity, as well as the inner part of the jet conical region. We observe remarkably steep values for the spectral index on sub-parsec scales ($\alpha \sim -2$, $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) which flatten around $\alpha \sim -0.8$ on parsec scales. We suggest that the observed steep values may result from particles being accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms in magnetized plasma and subsequently experiencing cooling through synchrotron losses. The brightness temperature of the 43 GHz cores indicates a dominance of the magnetic energy at the jet base, while the cores at progressively lower frequencies reveal a gradual transition towards equipartition. Based on the spectral index and brightness temperature along the incoming jet, and by employing theoretical models, we derive that the magnetic field strength has a close-to-linear dependence with distance going from parsec scales up to the jet apex. Overall, our findings are consistent with a toroidal-dominated magnetic field on all the analyzed scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Deconvolution of astronomical images is a key aspect of recovering the intrinsic properties of celestial objects, especially when considering ground-based observations. This paper explores the use of diffusion models (DMs) and the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) algorithm to solve this inverse problem task. We apply score-based DMs trained on high-resolution cosmological simulations, through a Bayesian setting to compute a posterior distribution given the observations available. By considering the redshift and the pixel scale as parameters of our inverse problem, the tool can be easily adapted to any dataset. We test our model on Hyper Supreme Camera (HSC) data and show that we reach resolutions comparable to those obtained by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Most importantly, we quantify the uncertainty of reconstructions and propose a metric to identify prior-driven features in the reconstructed images, which is key in view of applying these methods for scientific purposes.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterium was primarily created during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This fact, alongside its fractionation reactions resulting in enhanced abundances of deuterated molecules, means that these abundances can be used to better understand many processes within the interstellar medium (ISM), as well as its history. Previously, observations of deuterated molecules have been limited to the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds and (with respect to HD) to quasar absorption spectra. We present the first robust detection of a deuterated molecule in a starburst environment and, besides HD, the first one detected outside the Local Group. We therefore can constrain the deuterium fractionation, as observed by DCN. We observed the CMZ of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 covering multiple Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC) with cloud scale observations ($\sim 30$ pc) using ALMA. Via the use of the \texttt{MADCUBA} package we were able to perform LTE analysis in order to obtain deuterium fractionation estimates. We detect DCN in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 and estimate the deuterium fractionation (D/H ratio) of DCN within the GMCs of the CMZ of NGC 253. We find a range of $5 \times 10^{-4}$ to $10 \times 10^{-4}$, relatively similar to the values observed in warm Galactic star-forming regions. We also determine an upper limit of D/H of $8 \times 10^{-5}$ from DCO\plus within one region, closer to the cosmic value of D/H. Our observations of deuterated molecules within NGC 253 appear to be consistent with previous galactic studies of star forming regions. This implies that warmer gas temperatures increase the abundance of DCN relative to other deuterated species. This study also further expands the regions, particularly in the extragalactic domain, in which deuterated species have been detected.

 - **Abstract**
 The assumption of a flat universe that follows the cosmological principle, i.e., that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large scales, comprises one of the core foundations of the standard cosmological model -- namely, the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Nevertheless, it has been seldom tested in the literature. In this work, we assess the validity of this hypothesis by reconstructing the cosmic curvature with currently available observations, such as Type Ia Supernova and Cosmic Chronometers. We do so by means of null tests, given by consistency relations within the standard model scenario, using a non-parametric method -- which allows us to circumvent prior assumptions on the underlying cosmology. We find no statistically significant departure from the cosmological principle and null curvature in our analysis. In addition, we show that future cosmological observations, such as those expected from Hubble parameter measurements from redshift surveys, along with gravitational wave observations as standard sirens, will be able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of current reconstructions.
#### The dramatic transition of the extreme Red Supergiant WOH G64 to a Yellow Hypergiant

 - **Abstract**
 Red Supergiants (RSGs) are cool, evolved massive stars in the last evolutionary stage before exploding as a supernova. However, the most luminous RSGs may evolve blueward before exploding, given the observational evidence for luminous, warm, post-RSG objects and the lack of supernova progenitors originating from luminous RSGs. In this work, we analyze WOH G64, considered since the 1980s as the most extreme RSG in the Large Magellanic Cloud in terms of its size, luminosity, and mass-loss rate. Time-series photometry over the last 30 years reveals a sudden, yet smooth change from semi-regular to irregular variability in 2014. Multi-epoch optical spectroscopy confirms the transition, as WOH G64 now exhibits properties of a B[e] star in the optical, and warm-star features in the near-infrared. We report that WOH G64 has transitioned from a RSG to a Yellow Hypergiant and, moreover, has a B-star companion. The dramatic transition can be explained by: a) binary interactions partially stripping the envelope, b) the return of WOH G64 to a quiescent state after an outstanding eruption exceeding 30 years, and c) the expulsion of its outer layers due to a pre-SN superwind phase, indicating its imminent explosion. WOH G64 offers a unique opportunity to witness stellar evolution in real-time, providing crucial clues for the late phases of massive stars and their resulting supernovae.
#### A direct measurement of the electron density turbulence parameter $C_1$ towards the magnetar XTE J1810-197

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19330

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first, direct measurement of the electron density turbulence parameter $C_1$, enabled by 550-750 MHz observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The parameter $C_1$ depends on the power law index of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium. Radio waves propagating through the inhomogeneous ionized medium suffer multipath propagation, as a result of which the pulsed emission from a neutron star undergoes scatter broadening. Consequently, interference between the delayed copies of the scatter-broadened electric field manifests as scintillation. We measure a scintillation bandwidth $\Delta\nu_d=149\pm3$ Hz as well as a scatter-broadening timescale $\tau_d=1.22\pm0.09$ ms at 650 MHz towards the magnetar XTE J1810-197, using which we estimate $C_1=1.14\pm0.09$ directly from the uncertainty relation. This is also the first reported direct measurement of a scintillation bandwidth of order 100 Hz. We describe the methods employed to obtain these results and discuss their implications in general, as well as for the magnetar XTE J1810-197. We also discuss how such, effectively in-situ, measurements of $C_1$ can aid in inferring the wavenumber spectrum power law index, and hence, quantitatively discriminate between the various possible scattering scenarios in the ionized medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar mass distribution in star-forming regions, stellar clusters and associations, the Initial Mass Function (IMF), appears to be invariant across different star-forming environments, and is consistent with the IMF observed in the Galactic field. Deviations from the field, or standard, IMF, if genuine, would be considered strong evidence for a different set of physics at play during the formation of stars in the birth region in question. We analyse N-body simulations of the evolution of spatially and kinematically substructured star-forming regions to identify the formation of binary star clusters, where two (sub)clusters which form from the same Giant Molecular Cloud orbit a common centre of mass. We then compare the mass distributions of stars in each of the subclusters and compare them to the standard IMF, which we use to draw the stellar masses in the star-forming region from which the binary cluster(s) form. In each binary cluster that forms, the mass distributions of stars in one subcluster deviates from the standard IMF, and drastically so when we apply similar mass resolution limits as for the observed binary clusters. Therefore, if a binary subcluster is observed to have an unusual IMF, this may simply be the result of dynamical evolution, rather than different physical conditions for star formation in these systems.
#### Can the central compact object in HESS J1731--347 be indeed the lightest neutron star observed?

 - **Abstract**
 The exceptionally low mass of $0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.2} M_{\odot}$ for the central compact object (CCO) XMMU J173203.3 -- 344518 (XMMU J1732) in the supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731 -- 347 challenges standard neutron star (NS) formation models. The nearby post-AGB star IRAS 17287 -- 3443 ($\approx 0.6 M_\odot$), also within the SNR, enriches the scenario. To address this puzzle, we advance the possibility that the gravitational collapse of a rotating pre-SN iron core ($\approx 1.2 M_\odot$) could result in a low-mass NS. We show that angular momentum conservation during the collapse of an iron core rotating at $\approx 45\%$ of the Keplerian limit results in a mass loss of $\approx 0.3 M_\odot$, producing a stable newborn NS of $\approx 0.9 M_\odot$. Considering the possible spin-down, this indicates that the NS is now slowly rotating, thus fulfilling the observed mass-radius relation. Additionally, the NS's surface temperature ($\approx 2 \times 10^6$ K) aligns with canonical thermal evolution for its $\approx 4.5$ kyr age. We propose the pre -- SN star, likely an ultra-stripped core of $\approx 4.2 M_\odot$, formed a tidally locked binary with IRAS 17287 -- 3443, having a 1.43-day orbital period. The supernova led to a $\approx 3 M_\odot$ mass loss, imparting a kick velocity $\lesssim 670$ km s$^{-1}$, which disrupted the binary. This scenario explains the observed 0.3 pc offset between XMMU J1732 and IRAS 17287 -- 3443 and supports the possibility of CCOs forming in binaries, with rotation playing a key role in core-collapse, and the CCO XMMU J1732 being the lightest NS ever observed.

 - **Abstract**
 The QCD axion, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD, is a prominent candidate for dark matter (DM). In the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as those around neutron stars, axions can theoretically convert into photons, producing detectable electromagnetic signals. This axion-photon coupling provides a unique experimental pathway to probe axions within a specific mass range. We investigate a novel observational approach using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients that could arise from interactions between neutron stars and dense DM clumps known as axion miniclusters. By observing the core of Andromeda with the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz), we achieve sensitivity to axions with masses in the range of (33 - 42)$\,\mu$eV, with a mass resolution of $3.8 \times 10^{-4}\,\mu$eV. We detail our observational and analytical strategies developed to capture transient signals from axion-photon conversion, achieving an instrumental sensitivity of $2\,$mJy per spectral channel. Despite our sensitivity threshold, no candidate signals exceeding the 5$\sigma$ level were identified. Future implementations will extend this search across additional spectral bands and refine the modeling used for the processes involved, strengthening the constraints on axion DM models.
#### ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions -- XIX. The origin of SiO emission

 - **Abstract**
 The production of silicon monoxide (SiO) can be considered as a fingerprint of shock interaction. In this work, we use high-sensitivity observations of the SiO (2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1-0) emission to investigate the broad and narrow SiO emission toward 146 massive star-forming regions in the ATOMS survey. We detected SiO emission in 136 regions and distinguished broad and narrow components across the extension of 118 sources (including 58 UC $H_{II}$ regions) with an average angular resolution of 2.5$^{\prime}$$^{\prime}$. The derived SiO luminosity ($L_{SiO}$) across the whole sample shows that the majority of $L_{SiO}$ (above 66$\%$) can be attributed to broad SiO, indicating its association with strong outflows. The comparison of the ALMA SiO images with the filamentary skeletons identified from H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and in the infrared data (at 4.5, 8, and 24 $mu$m), further confirms that most SiO emission originates from outflows. However, note that for nine sources in our sample, the observed SiO emission may be generated by expanding UC $H_{II}$ regions. There is a moderate positive correlation between the bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and $L_{SiO}$ for both components (narrow and broad). The UC $H_{II}$ sources show a weaker positive correlation between $L_{bol}$ and $L_{SiO}$ and higher $L_{SiO}$ compared to the sources without UC $H_{II}$ regions. These results imply that the SiO emission from UC $H_{II}$ sources might be affected by UV-photochemistry induced by UC $H_{II}$ regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays (CRs) are fundamental to the chemistry and physics of star-forming regions, influencing molecular gas ionization, mediating interactions with interstellar magnetic fields, and regulating star formation from the diffuse interstellar medium to the creation of stellar cores. The electronic GeV component of CRs is expected to produce non-thermal synchrotron radiation detectable at radio frequencies, yet such emissions from Galactic star-forming regions remain elusive. This study reports the first statistical attempt to detect synchrotron emission at 144 MHz using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) in the nearby Perseus molecular cloud (300 pc). By median-stacking 353 prestellar and 132 protostellar cores from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey and using LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) data (20" resolution), 18 protostellar and 5 prestellar radio candidates were initially identified. However, these were likely extragalactic contaminants within the Herschel catalog. Stacked analyses did not reveal significant radio counterparts for prestellar and protostellar cores, with upper limits of $5\, \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and $8\, \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. Non-detections suggest strong extinction mechanisms like free-free absorption and the Razin-Tsytovich effect for protostellar cores. For prestellar cores, analytical magnetostatic-isothermal models constrain the maximum ordered magnetic-field strength to 100 $\mu$G. Future predictions suggest that Square Kilometre Array-Low (SKA-Low) arrays could detect this emission in 9 hours (AA*) or 4 hours (AA4), enabling more sensitive constraints on synchrotron radiation in star-forming cores.

 - **Abstract**
 The fine structures of solar radio bursts reveal complex dynamics in the corona, yet the observed characteristics of these sub-second bursts are additionally complicated by radio wave scattering in the turbulent solar corona. We examine the impact of anisotropic turbulence in radio-wave propagation simulations with non-radial magnetic field structures in shaping the morphology, time-characteristics, and source position of fine structures. The apparent sources are found to move along the direction of the magnetic-field lines and not along the density gradient, whereas the major axis of the scattered source is perpendicular to the local magnetic field (the scattering anisotropy axis). Using a dipolar magnetic field structure of an active region, we reproduce observed radio fine structure source motion parallel to the solar limb associated with a coronal loop and provide a natural explanation for puzzling observations of solar radio burst position motions with LOFAR. Furthermore, the anisotropy aligned with a dipolar magnetic field causes the apparent source images to bifurcate into two distinct components, with characteristic sizes smaller than in unmagnetized media. The temporal broadening induced by scattering reduces the observed frequency drift rate of fine structures, depending on the contribution of scattering to the time profile. The findings underscore the role of magnetic field geometry and anisotropic scattering for the interpretation of solar radio bursts and highlight that anisotropic scattering produces more than a single source.

 - **Abstract**
 This work focuses on the ice features toward the binary protostellar system Ced 110 IRS 4A and 4B, and observed with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Ice Age collaboration. We aim to explore the JWST observations of the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B to unveil and quantify the ice inventories toward these sources. We compare the ice abundances with those found for the same molecular cloud. The analysis is performed by fitting or comparing laboratory infrared spectra of ices to the observations. Spectral fits are carried out with the ENIIGMA fitting tool that searches for the best fit. For Ced~110~IRS4B, we detected the major ice species H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ and NH$_3$. All species are found in a mixture except for CO and CO$_2$, which have both mixed and pure ice components. In the case of Ced~110~IRS4A, we detected the same major species as in Ced~110~IRS4B, as well as the following minor species CH$_4$, SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, OCN$^-$, NH$_4^+$ and HCOOH. Tentative detection of N$_2$O ice (7.75~$\mu$m), forsterite dust (11.2~$\mu$m) and CH$_3^+$ gas emission (7.18~$\mu$m) in the primary source are also presented. Compared with the two lines of sight toward background stars in the Chameleon I molecular cloud, the protostar has similar ice abundances, except in the case of the ions that are higher in IRS4A. The clearest differences are the absence of the 7.2 and 7.4~$\mu$m absorption features due to HCOO$^-$ and icy complex organic molecules in IRS4A and evidence of thermal processing in both IRS4A and IRS4B as probed by the CO$_2$ ice features. We conclude that the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B has a large inventory of icy species. The similar ice abundances in comparison to the starless regions in the same molecular cloud suggest that the chemical conditions of the protostar were set at earlier stages in the molecular cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Disk winds play a crucial role in the evolution of protoplanetary disks. Typical conditions for star and planet formation are in regions with intermediate or strong UV radiation fields produced by massive stars. The $\sigma$-Orionis cluster is the ideal site to study disk winds under these conditions; its outer parts can be used to study disk evolution, while its innermost regions to study the effect of external irradiation. For this, we analyze the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300, $\rm [NII]\,\lambda$6583, and $\rm [SII]\,\lambda$6731,$\lambda$6716 lines using high-resolution MIKE spectra of 27 classical T Tauri stars and complemented by intermediate-resolution X-shooter data. We decompose the line profiles into multiple Gaussian components. We calculated luminosities, line ratios, and kinematic properties of these components. We found that the $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line luminosity and kinematic properties are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs). The frequency of single-component $\rm [OI]\,\lambda$6300 line profiles reflects the expected evolutionary stage given the intermediate age of $\sigma$-Orionis. This points to internal processes contributing to the line emission. However, the highly irradiated disks do not follow the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation found in low-mass SFRs, and all exhibit single-component line profiles. Line ratios of highly ionized species of [NII] and [SII] show higher ratios than typical values found in low-mass SFRs. The innermost regions of $\sigma$-Orionis are clearly affected by external irradiation, evidenced by the lack of correlation in the accretion - [OI] luminosity relation. The broad line widths of close-in sources, however, indicate a contribution from internal processes, such as magnetohydrodynamical winds and/or internal photoevaporation. This suggests a coevolution of internal and external winds in $\sigma$-Orionis.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of toroidal magnetic fields within the interior of stars remains a significant unresolved issue in contemporary astrophysics. In this study, we combine a nonlocal linear analysis with 3D direct numerical simulations to examine the instability of toroidal fields within nonrotating, stably stratified stellar interiors in spherical geometry. Both analyses start from an equilibrium solution derived from balancing the Lorentz force with an anisotropic component of the fluid pressure, which is unstable to the (nonaxisymmetric) Tayler instability, and account for the combined effects of gravity and thermal diffusion. The numerical simulations incorporate finite magnetic resistivity and fluid viscosity while reaching a regime of highly stable stratification that has never been explored before. The linear analysis, which is global in the radial direction, shows that gravity significantly reduces the growth rate of the instability and uncovers the importance of unstable modes with low radial wavenumbers operating at low latitudes. The simulations trace the entire evolution of the instability from the linear to the nonlinear phase and strongly corroborate the findings of the linear analysis. Our results reveal that in highly stratified stellar interiors, the newly configured magnetic fields remain unstable only on the thermal diffusion timescale. Combining the linear analysis results with stellar evolution models of low-mass stars, we find that the limiting toroidal field strength for Tayler instability in red giant cores decreases with the stellar evolution. The predicted field strengths align with the ones expected from recent asteroseismic observations, suggesting that the observed fields may be remnants of a Tayler instability during the transition from the main sequence to the giant phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.
