 - **Abstract**
 Detections of Earth-analog planets in radial velocity observations are limited by stellar astrophysical variability occurring on a variety of timescales. Current state-of-the-art methods to disentangle potential planet signals from intrinsic stellar signals assume that stellar signals introduce asymmetries to the line profiles that can therefore be separated from the pure translational Doppler shifts of planets. Here, we examine this assumption using a time series of resolved stellar p-mode oscillations in HD 142091 ($\kappa$ CrB), as observed on a single night with the NEID spectrograph at 2-minute cadence and with 25 cm/s precision. As an evolved subgiant star, this target has p-mode oscillations that are larger in amplitude (4-8 m/s) and occur on longer timescales (80 min.) than those of typical Sun-like stars of RV surveys, magnifying their corresponding effects on the stellar spectral profile. We show that for HD 142091, p-mode oscillations manifest primarily as pure Doppler shifts in the average line profile -- measured by the cross-correlation function (CCF) -- with "shape-driven" CCF variations as a higher-order effect. Specifically, we find that the amplitude of the shift varies across the CCF bisector, with 10% larger oscillation amplitudes closer to the core of the CCF, and 25% smaller oscillation amplitudes for bisector velocities derived near the wings; we attribute this trend to larger oscillation velocities higher in the stellar atmosphere. Using a line-by-line analysis, we verify that a similar trend is seen as a function of average line depth, with deeper lines showing larger oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we find no evidence that p-mode oscillations have a chromatic dependence across the NEID bandpass beyond that due to intrinsic line depth differences across the spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared imaging to search for a quiescent or transient counterpart to FRB 20250316A, which was precisely localized with the CHIME/FRB Outriggers array to an area of $11\times13$ pc in the outer regions of NGC 4141 at $d\approx40$ Mpc. Our F150W2 image reveals a faint source near the center of the FRB localization region ("NIR-1"; $M_{\rm F150W2}\approx-2.5$ mag; probability of chance coincidence $\approx0.36$), the only source within $\approx2.7\sigma$. We find that it is too faint to be a globular cluster, young star cluster, red supergiant star, or a giant star near the tip of the red giant branch (RGB). It is instead consistent with a red giant near the RGB "clump" or a massive ($\gtrsim20$ M$_{\odot}$) main sequence star, although the latter explanation is less likely. The source is too bright to be a supernova remnant, Crab-like pulsar wind nebula, or isolated magnetar. Alternatively, NIR-1 may represent transient emission, namely a dust echo from an energetic outburst associated with the FRB, in which case we would expect it to fade in future observations. We explore the stellar population near the FRB and find that it is composed of a mix of young massive stars ($\sim10-100$ Myr) in a nearby HII region that extends to the location of FRB 20250316A, and old evolved stars ($\gtrsim$ Gyr). The overlap with a young stellar population, containing stars of up to $\approx20$ M$_\odot$, may implicate a neutron star / magnetar produced in the core collapse of a massive star as the source of FRB 20250316A.

 - **Abstract**
 Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and "fuzzy" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the density ratio parameter R$_{\rho}$, which governs in an approximate way the efficiency of semi-convection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning R$_{\rho}$=1 (Ledoux) to R$_{\rho}$=0 (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower R$_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also agree with the observed Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we derive systemic velocities and subsequently orbits for 8456 RR~Lyrae stars. We identify interlopers from other Milky Way (MW) structures, which amount to 22 percent of the total sample. Most interlopers are associated with the halo, with the remainder linked to the Galactic disk. We confirm the previously reported lag in the rotation curve of bulge RR~Lyrae stars regardless of the removal of interlopers. Metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars' rotation patterns are consistent with that of non-variable metal-rich giants, following the MW bar, while metal-poor stars exhibit slower rotation. The analysis of orbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar reference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We classify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity (in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with banana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the distance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of stars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the fraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The retrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally concentrated nearly spherical distribution. Analyzing an $N$-body+SPH simulation, we find that some stellar particles in the central parts oscillate between retrograde and prograde orbits and only a minority stays prograde over a long period of time. Based on the simulation, the ratio between prograde and retrograde stellar particles seems to stabilize within a couple of gigayears after bar formation. The non-chaoticity of retrograde orbits and their high numbers can explain some of the spatial and kinematical features of the MW bulge that have been often associated with a classical bulge.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for six metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]<-3 (including one with [Fe/H]<-4), selected using narrow-band Ca II HK photometry from the DECam MAGIC Survey. The spectroscopic data confirms the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allows for the determination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium. The program stars have chemical abundances consistent with this metallicity range. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to the distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 < dhelio/kpc < 55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated with the Magellanic system and one, J0026-5445, having parameters consistent with being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show kinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger. J0433-5548, with [Fe/H]=-4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with [C/Fe]=+1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star, and its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free supernova models. Results suggest that J0433-5548 could have been formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from a ~11Mo star in the early universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the reliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target selection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its satellite population. These discoveries illustrate the power of measuring chemical abundances of metal-poor Milky Way halo stars to learn more about early galaxy formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 OVz stars are identified by their optical spectra, in which the He II 4686 absorption line is stronger than any other He line. This spectral characteristic suggests that these stars may be less luminous, less evolved, and located closer to the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Although their evolutionary status is still debated, OVz stars are key candidates for understanding the earliest stages of massive star evolution. In this study, we analyze OVz stars in the star-forming regions NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to determine their physical properties and investigate the role of low metallicity in the emergence of the Vz peculiarity. We identified a sample of OVz and OV stars in NGC 346 using spectra obtained with the Magellan Echellette (MagE) spectrograph at Las Campanas Observatory. Spectral classification was based on the equivalent width ratios of key He lines. Quantitative spectroscopic analyses were carried out using the IACOB-BROAD and IACOB-GBAT/FASTWIND tools. For consistency, previously identified OV and OVz stars in 30 Doradus were reclassified following the same criteria.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultraviolet and optical wavelength ranges have proven to be a key addition to infrared observations of exoplanet atmospheres, as they offer unique insights into the properties of clouds and hazes and are sensitive to signatures of disequilibrium chemistry. Here we present the 0.2-0.8 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of the Teq = 2000 K Jupiter KELT-7b, acquired with HST WFC3/UVIS G280 as part of the HUSTLE Treasury program. We combined this new spectrum with the previously published HST WFC3/IR G141 (1.1-1.7 $\mu$m) spectrum and Spitzer photometric points at 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m, to reveal a generally featureless transmission spectrum between 0.2 and 1.7 $\mu$m, with a slight downward slope towards bluer wavelengths, and a asymmetric water feature in the 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m band. Retrieval models conclude that the 0.2 - 1.7$\mu$m spectrum is primarily explained by a high H- abundance ($\sim 10^{-5}$), significantly above the equilibrium chemistry prediction ($\sim 10^{-12}$), suggesting disequilibrium in KELT-7b's upper atmosphere. Our retrievals also suggest the presence of bright inhomogeneities in the stellar surface, and tentative evidence of CO2 at the Spitzer wavelengths. We demonstrate that with the UV-optical coverage provided by WFC3 UVIS/G280, we are able to confirm the presence and constrain the abundance of H-, and obtain evidence for bright stellar inhomogeneities that would have been overlooked using infrared data alone. Observations redward of 1$\mu$m with JWST should be able to further constrain the abundance of H-, as well as confirm the presence of CO2 inferred by the two Spitzer datapoints.

 - **Abstract**
 Line resolved X-ray spectra of outflows from X-ray binaries are interesting since they provide quantifiable measures of the accreted material on to the compact object (black hole or neutron star), which can not be observed directly in the accretion disk. One such measurement that has been largely overlooked is that of the elemental abundances, which potentially provide insights into the origin of the ejected material. Using the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer we measure and present elemental abundances in four low-mass X-ray binaries. We compare two measurement methods. One is by fitting line series of individual ions and reconstructing the absorption measure distribution (AMD), and the other is a global fit with one or two individual ionization components. All outflows feature a steep AMD strongly favoring high ionization degrees. The present abundances are consistent with previous works suggesting the abundances in the outflows are non-solar. We find a tentative trend of increasing abundances with atomic number, which fits some core-collapse supernova models, but no exact match to a specific one.

 - **Abstract**
 We present International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) observations of the Crab Nebula, the remnant of a core-collapse supernova explosion observed by astronomers in 1054. The field of the Crab Nebula was observed between 120 and 168 MHz as part of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), and the data were re-processed to include the LOFAR international stations to create a high angular resolution ($0.43'' \times 0.28''$) map at a central frequency of 145 MHz. Combining the ILT map with archival centimeter-range observations of the Nebula with the Very Large Array (VLA) and LOFAR data at 54 MHz, we become sensitive to the effects of free-free absorption against the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind nebula. This absorption is caused by the ionised filaments visible in optical and infrared data of the Crab Nebula, which are the result of the pulsar wind nebula expanding into the denser stellar ejecta that surrounds it and forming Rayleigh-Taylor fingers. The LOFAR observations are sensitive to two components of these filaments: their dense cores, which show electron densities of $\gtrsim1,000$ cm$^{-3}$, and the diffuse envelopes, with electron densities of $\sim50-250$ cm$^{-3}$. The denser structures have widths of $\sim0.03$ pc, whereas the diffuse component is at one point as large as $0.2$ pc. The morphology of the two components is not always the same. These finding suggests that the layered temperature, density, and ionisation structure of the Crab optical filaments extends to larger scales than previously considered.

 - **Abstract**
 Metal-bearing species in diffuse or molecular clouds are often overlooked in astrochemical modeling except for the charge exchange process. However, catalytic cycles involving these metals can affect the abundance of other compounds. We prepared a comprehensive chemical network for Na, Mg, Al, Fe, K, and Si-containing species. Assuming water as the major constituent of interstellar ice in dark clouds, quantum chemical calculations were carried out to estimate the binding energy of important metallic species, considering amorphous solid water as substrate. Significantly lower binding energies (approximately 5 to 6 times) were observed for Na and Mg, while the value for Fe was roughly 4 times higher than what was used previously. Here, we calculated binding energy values for Al and K, for which no prior guesses were available. The total dipole moments and enthalpies of formation for several newly included species are unknown. Furthermore, the assessment of reaction enthalpies is necessary to evaluate the feasibility of the new reactions under interstellar conditions. These parameters were estimated and subsequently integrated into models. Some additional species that were not included in the UMIST/KIDA database have been introduced. The addition of these new species, along with their corresponding reactions, appears to significantly affect the abundances of related species. Some key reactions that significantly influence general metal-related chemistry include: $\rm{M^+ + H_2 \rightarrow M{H_2}^+ + h\nu}$, $\rm{MH + O \rightarrow MO + H}$ ($\rm{M \ = \ Fe, \ Na, \ Mg, \ Al, \ K}$), and $\rm{M_1^+ + M_2H \rightarrow M_1H + M_2^+}$ (where $\rm{M_1 \neq M_2}$, $M_1, \ M_2 \ = \ Na, \ Mg, \ Al, \ K, \ Fe$). Significant changes were observed in magnesium and sodium-bearing cyanides, isocyanides, and aluminum fluoride when additional reaction pathways were considered.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Cosmic voids are vast underdense regions in the cosmic web that encode crucial information about structure formation, the composition of the Universe, and its expansion history. Due to their lower density, these regions are less affected by non-linear gravitational dynamics, making them suitable candidates for analysis using semi-analytic methods. Aims. We assess the accuracy of the PINOCCHIO code, a fast tool for generating dark matter halo catalogs based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory, in modeling the statistical properties of cosmic voids. We validate this approach by comparing the resulting void statistics measured from PINOCCHIO to those obtained from N-body simulations. Methods. We generate a set of simulations using PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, assuming a fiducial cosmology and varying the resolution. For a given resolution, the simulations share the same initial conditions between the different simulation codes. Snapshots are saved at multiple redshifts for each simulation and post-processed using the watershed void finder VIDE to identify cosmic voids. For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics: void size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the void radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy of PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids. Results. We find agreement for all void statistics at better than 2{\sigma} between PINOCCHIO and OpenGADGET3, with no systematic difference in redshift trends. This demonstrates that the PINOCCHIO code can reliably produce void statistics with high computational efficiency compared to full N-body simulations.
#### The H$α$ line as a probe of chromospheric magnetic fields

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the diagnostic potential of the H$\alpha$ line for probing the chromospheric magnetic field using a realistic 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) model. The Stokes profiles of the H$\alpha$ line are synthesized through full 3D radiative transfer under the field-free approximation, alongside the Ca II 8542 Å and Fe I 6173 Å lines for comparison. The line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields are inferred using the weak field approximation (WFA) for theH$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 Å lines, while the Fe I 6173 Å line is analyzed through Milne-Eddington inversion techniques. The comparison between the inferred LOS magnetic field maps and the magnetic fields in the rMHD model revealed that the H$\alpha$ line core primarily probes the chromospheric magnetic field at log tau_500 = -5.7, which corresponds to higher layers than the Ca II 8542 Å line core, which is most sensitive to conditions at log tau_500 = -5.1. On average, the Stokes V profiles of the H$\alpha$ line core form 500 km higher than those of the Ca II 8542 Å line core. The H$\alpha$ polarization signals persist after adding noise, and with noise at the level of 10^-3 Ic, most simulated magnetic structures remain visible. These findings suggest that spectropolarimetric observations of the H$\alpha$ line can provide complementary insights into the stratification of the magnetic field at higher altitudes, especially when recorded simultaneously with widely used chromospheric diagnostics such as the Ca II 8542 Å line.

 - **Abstract**
 Common envelope (CE) evolution is largely governed by the drag torque applied on the inspiralling stellar components by the envelope. Previous work has shown that idealized models of the torque based on a single body moving in rectilinear motion through an unperturbed atmosphere can be highly inaccurate. Progress requires new models for the torque that account for binarity. Toward this end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of the companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant branch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation. First, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to their separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density pattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is roughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial distribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose major axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary components by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably well, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we compare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model that assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a uniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with our results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction ($\approx0.44$) of the density at the spheroid surface. Overall, this work makes progress toward developing simple time-dependent models of the CE phase.
#### Characterizing the Observational Properties of the Sun's High-latitude m=1 Inertial Mode

 - **Abstract**
 Low-m inertial modes have been recently discovered in the Sun's high-latitude regions. In this study, we characterize the observational properties of the m = 1 mode by analyzing time-distance subsurface flow maps. Synoptic flow maps, constructed from daily subsurface flow maps using a tracking rate corresponding to the rotation at latitude 65 degrees, are filtered in both the spherical harmonic and Fourier domains to retain only the m = 1 mode and its dominant frequencies. Our analysis reveals a power distribution that is significantly stronger in the northern polar region. The mode's power exhibits an anti-correlation with solar activity, remaining strong and persistent during the solar activity minimum and becoming weaker and more fragmented during the solar maximum. Magnetic flux transported from low to high latitudes influences both the mode's power and lifetime, enhancing its power and shortening its lifetime upon arrival. The phases of the m = 1 mode in the northern and southern polar regions are near-antisymmetric for most of the time with short deviations. We also compute zonal and meridional phase velocities of the mode and find that it exhibits significantly less differential rotation than its surrounding plasma. The meridional phase velocity, comprising both the local plasma's meridional flow and the mode's intrinsic phase motion, is directed poleward below latitude 70 degrees and equatorward above this latitude. These observational findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics of the low-m modes, which may offer valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of the solar interior.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently, achieving a balance between computational efficiency, accuracy, and numerical stability in CME simulations, particularly in the sub-Alfv{'e}nic coronal region, remains a significant challenge. This paper aims to address the challenge by integrating observational data and developing advanced numerical algorithms, focusing on reproducing large-scale CME evolutions that are consistent with observations in the coronal region. Based on the recently developed fully implicit thermodynamic MHD coronal model (Wang et al. 2025a), we further use an observation-based RBSL flux rope to trigger a CME event during CR 2111. Additionally, we improve the temporal accuracy using a 2nd-order accurate ESDIRK2 method, with the intermediate stage solutions computed by the 2nd-order accurate BDF2 pseudo-time marching method. To enhance the numerical stability of ESDIRK2, we apply approximate linearisation in the implicitly solved intermediate stages. Furthermore, we adjust the time-evolving magnetic field B1 to zero at the end of each physical time step to further validate the extended magnetic field decomposition approach proposed by (Wang et al. 2025a). It is noticed that the model successfully reproduces the CME evolution consistent with white-light coronagraph observations, enables faster-than-real-time CME propagation simulations from solar surface to 0.1 AU using only a few dozen CPU cores on approximately 1 million grid cells, and remains numerically stable in CME simulations involving low-\b{eta} regions. The simulation results show that this novel MHD coronal model, combined with an observation-based magnetic flux rope, is sufficiently numerically stable and computationally efficient to reproduce real CME events propagating through the sub-Alfv{é}nic coronal region. Thus, the observation-based CME model is well suited for practical applications in daily space weather forecasting.

 The existence of high galactic latitude molecular clouds has been known for several decades, and studies of their dust and gas distributions reveal complicated morphological structures. Their dynamics involve turbulence even in the absence of internal energy sources such as stars. We study in detail two such clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and topology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of superthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of filament superposition combined with turbulent motions. We use a variety of spectroscopic and imaging archival observations of the gas and dust components. The spectroscopic data set comprises HI 21 cm, 12CO, 13CO, and CH line profiles. We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution and temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare molecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm line. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used to characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity diagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The unusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to superposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1 km/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures with similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths of about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc. In general, the molecular gas is embedded within more extended neutral hydrogen structures. Velocity gradients found within these structures are not necessarily dynamical, convergent flows. Projection effects and topology of the driving flows produce signatures that mimic velocity shears even if they are simply distortions of ordered gas.

 - **Abstract**
 External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs, by massive O stars in stellar clusters, is thought to be a significant process in the evolution of a disc. It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation, ultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential planet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to its proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in additional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and significance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where the majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more distant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current facilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of external photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret external photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially unresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code to develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from the hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which line ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that the most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV field of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients of line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external photoevaporation.
