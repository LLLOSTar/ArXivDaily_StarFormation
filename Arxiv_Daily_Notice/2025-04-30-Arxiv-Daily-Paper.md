 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale morphology of Milky Way (MW)-mass dark matter (DM) halos is shaped by two key processes: filamentary accretion from the cosmic web and interactions with massive satellites. Disentangling their contributions is essential for understanding galaxy evolution and constructing accurate mass models of the MW. We analyze the time-dependent structure of MW-mass halos from zoomed cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations by decomposing their mass distribution into spherical harmonic expansions. We find that the dipole ($\ell=1$) and quadrupole ($\ell=2$) moments dominate the gravitational power spectrum, encoding key information about the halo's shape and its interaction with the cosmic environment. While the dipole reflects transient perturbations from infalling satellites and damps on dynamical timescales, the quadrupole -- linked to the halo's triaxiality -- is a persistent feature. We show that the quadrupole's orientation aligns with the largest filaments, imprinting a long-lived memory on the halo's morphology even in its inner regions ($\sim30$ kpc). At the virial radius, the quadrupole distortion can reach 1-2 times the spherical density, highlighting the importance of environment in shaping MW-mass halos. Using multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis, we successfully disentangle the effects of satellite mergers and filamentary accretion on quadrupole. We find that the quadrupolar response induced by LMC-mass satellites has an order of magnitude larger gravitational power than in spherically symmetric MW models. This highlights the need for models that incorporate the MW's asymmetry and time-evolution, with direct consequences for observable structures such as disk warps, the LMC-induced wake, and stellar tracers -- particularly in the era of precision astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 The variation of metal production over time and its dilution in the interstellar medium depend on the star formation and gas accretion rates. Measuring age-chemistry relations across the Milky Way disk provides key constraints on the gas accretion and star formation histories, and offers insight into the birth locations of stars. We present a study based on a sample of nearly 30000 dwarf stars from the APOGEE DR17 survey within 2 kpc of the Sun, for which we measure accurate ages. Various parameter combinations are tested to optimize stellar age determination from isochrones. The resulting age-chemistry relations for a selected subsample of 12000 stars are interpreted with the aid of a chemical evolution model. The data reveal a well-defined, tight thick disk sequence, characterized by high [alpha/Fe], subsolar metallicities, and ages older than 8 Gyr. The thin disk, with lower [alpha/Fe] and younger ages, exhibits a wide spread in metallicity at all ages, with apparent structures. Dividing the sample by guiding radius into inner, intermediate, and outer disks shows distinct chemical evolution patterns. The inner disk displays a monotonic, homogeneous chemical evolution with little dispersion, while the outer disk shows little metallicity increase over the past 8 Gyr. The solar neighborhood appears as a mixture, not only due to stellar migration but also because the chemical evolution of the ISM in this intermediate region results from the mixing of gas from the inner and outer disks. In particular, we demonstrate that the solar vicinity experienced a decrease in the mean ISM metallicity 7-9 Gyr ago. A plausible explanation involves a radial inflow of lower-metallicity gas from the outer disk at that time, which diluted the gas leftover by the thick disk formation, contributing to the observed metallicity gradient in the intermediate region.

 - **Abstract**
 We report JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the H2 S(1) 17.04 micron transition in two regions in the boundary of the Taurus Molecular Cloud. The two regions, denoted Edge (near the relatively sharp boundary of the 13CO J=1-0 emission) and Peak (the location of the strongest H2 emission observed with Spitzer), have average intensities of 14.5 MJy/sr and 32.1 MJy/sr, respectively. We find small scale structures of characteristic size 1.0 to 2.5 arcseconds, corresponding to 140 AU to 350 AU, with characteristic intensity above the extended background of 10 MJy/sr, corresponding to a J = 3 column density of 1.6x1017/cm2. The most plausible explanation for the observed intensities from level 845 K above the J = 1 ortho-H2 ground state level is excitation by collisions with H2 molecules (the hydrogen in this region being predominantly molecular). Two mechanisms, turbulent dissipation and shocks, have been proposed for heating of localized regions of the ISM to temperatures ~1000 K to explain abundances of and emission from particular molecules. While we cannot determine unique values of density and kinetic temperature, the solutions in best agreement with predictions of shock models are H2 density = 370 /cm3 and kinetic temperature = 1000 K. The total H2 column density of the small-scale structures under these conditions is ~8x1017/cm2. This first direct detection of heated tiny scale structure in the quiescent molecular interstellar medium has significant implications for the physical structure of this phase of the ISM and maintaining supersonic motions within it.
#### The Cosmic Evolution of CIV Absorbers at $1.4<z<4.5$: Insights from $100,000$ Systems in DESI Quasars

 - **Abstract**
 We present the largest catalog to \modify{date} of triply ionized carbon (CIV) absorbers detected in quasar spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Using an automated matched-kernel convolution method with adaptive signal-to-noise thresholds, we identify $101,487$ CIV systems in the redshift range $ 1.4 < z < 4.8 $ from $300,637$ quasar spectra. Completeness is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations and catalog is $50\%$ complete at $\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{CIV}} \geq 0.4$ Angstrom. The differential equivalent width frequency distribution declines exponentially and shows weak redshift evolution. The absorber incidence per unit comoving path increases by a factor of $2-5$ from $ z \approx 4.5 $ to $ z \approx 1.4 $, with stronger redshift evolution for strong systems. Using column densities derived from the apparent optical depth method, we constrain the cosmic mass density of CIV, $\Omega_{\mathrm{CIV}}$, which increases by a factor of $\sim 3.6$ from $ (0.46 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-8} $ at $ z \approx 4.5 $ to $ (1.65 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{-8} $ at $ z \approx 1.4 $. From $ \Omega_{\rm CIV} $, we estimate a lower limit on intergalactic medium metallicity $ \log(Z_{\rm IGM}/Z_{\odot}) \gtrsim -3.5 $ at $ z \sim 2.3 $, with a smooth decline at higher redshifts. These trends trace the cosmic star formation history and HeII photoheating rate, suggesting a link between CIV enrichment, star formation, and UV background over $\sim 3$ Gyr. The catalog also provides a critical resource for future studies connecting circumgalactic metals to galaxy evolution, especially near cosmic noon.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is a massively parallel spectroscopic survey on the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak, which has released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations determined from over 14 million extragalactic targets. We combine DESI Data Release 2 with CMB datasets to search for evidence of matter conversion to dark energy (DE), focusing on a scenario mediated by stellar collapse to cosmologically-coupled black holes (CCBH). In this physical model, which has the same number of free parameters as $\Lambda$CDM, DE production is determined by the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), allowing for distinct early- and late-time cosmologies. Using two SFRDs to bracket current observations, we find that the CCBH model: accurately recovers the cosmological expansion history, agrees with early-time baryon abundance measured by BBN, reduces tension with the local distance ladder, and relaxes constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$. For these SFRDs, we find a peaked positive $\sum m_\nu < 0.149\,\rm eV$ (95\% confidence) and $\sum m_\nu = 0.106^{+0.050}_{-0.069}\,\rm eV$ respectively, in good agreement with lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments. A peak in $\sum m_\nu > 0$ results from late-time baryon consumption in the CCBH scenario and is expected to be a general feature of any model that converts sufficient matter to dark energy during and after reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightness and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that a variable progenitor has been found for a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN 2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--14, 14--15 and 15--18 Msun for different assumed values of circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes, the most common planet type, remain poorly understood. Their atmospheres are expected to be diverse, but their compositions are challenging to determine, even with JWST. Here, we present the first JWST spectroscopic study of the warm sub-Neptune GJ3090b (2.13R$_\oplus$, Teq~700 K) which orbits an M2V star, making it a favourable target for atmosphere characterization. We observed four transits of GJ3090b; two each using JWST NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/G395H, yielding wavelength coverage from 0.6-5.2 $\mu$m. We detect the signature of the 10833 Å metastable Helium triplet at a statistical significance of 5.5$\sigma$ with an amplitude of 434$\pm$79 ppm, marking the first such detection in a sub-Neptune with JWST. This amplitude is significantly smaller than predicted by solar-metallicity forward models, suggesting a metal-enriched atmosphere which decreases the mass-loss rate and attenuates the Helium feature amplitude. Moreover, we find that stellar contamination, in the form of the transit light source effect, dominates the NIRISS transmission spectra, with unocculted spot and faculae properties varying across the two visits separated in time by approximately six months. Free retrieval analyses on the NIRSpec/G395H spectrum find tentative evidence for highly muted features and a lack of CH4. These findings are best explained by a high metallicity atmosphere (>100x solar at 3$\sigma$ confidence, for clouds at $\sim \mu$bar pressures) using chemically-consistent retrievals and self-consistent model grids. Further observations of GJ3090b are needed for tighter constraints on the atmospheric abundances, and to gain a deeper understanding of the processes that led to its potential metal enrichment.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the ejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 Msun, while in the circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is 0.001-0.004 Msun.

 - **Abstract**
 The eruption of the filament/flux rope generates the coronal perturbations, which further form EUV waves. There are two types of EUV waves, including fast-mode magnetosonic waves and slow waves. In this paper, we first report an event showing the Quasiperiodic Slow-Propagating (QSP) EUV "wave" trains during an M6.4-class flare (SOL2023-02-25T18:40), using multiple observations from SDO/AIA, CHASE/HIS, ASO-S/FMG, SUTRI, and LASCO/C2. The QSP "wave" trains occurred as the filament showed a rapid rise. The QSP "wave" trains have the projected speeds of 50-130 km s$^{-1}$ on the plane of the sky, which is slower than the fast-mode magnetosonic speed in the solar corona. And the calculated period of the QSP wave trains is 117.9 s, which is in good agreement with the associated flare Quasi-Periodic Pulsation (140.3 s). The QSP wave trains could be observed during the entire impulsive phase of the flare and lasted about 30 minutes in the field of view (FOV) of SDO/AIA. About 30 minutes later, they appeared in the FOV of LASCO/C2 and propagated to the northwest. We suggest that the QSP wave trains are probably apparent waves that are caused by the successive stretching of the inclined field lines overlying the eruptive filament. The periodic pattern of the QSP wave trains may be related to the intermittent energy release during the flare.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar nanojets are small-scale jets generated by component magnetic reconnection, characterized by collimated plasma motion perpendicular to the reconnecting magnetic field lines. As an indicator of nanoflare events, they are believed to play a significant role in coronal heating. Using high-resolution extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) imaging observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter mission, we identified 27 nanojets in an erupting filament on September 30, 2024. They are potentially associated with the untwisting of magnetic field lines of the filament. Most nanojets exhibit velocities around 450 km s$^{-1}$, with the fastest reaching approximately 800 km s$^{-1}$, significantly higher than previously reported but comparable to the typical coronal Alfvén speed. To our knowledge, these are the highest speeds ever reported for small-scale jets (less than ~1 Mm wide) in the solar atmosphere. Our findings suggest that these nanoflare-type phenomena can be more dynamic than previously recognized and may contribute to the energy release process of solar eruptions and the heating of coronal active regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron star mergers provide insight into strong-field gravity and the properties of ultra-dense nuclear matter. These events offer the potential to search for signatures of physics beyond the standard model, including dark matter. We present the first numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers admixed with dark matter, based on constraint-solved initial data. Modeling dark matter as a non-interacting fermionic gas, we investigate the impact of varying dark matter fractions and particle masses on the merger dynamics, ejecta mass, post-merger remnant properties, and the emitted gravitational waves. Our simulations suggest that the dark matter morphology - a dense core or a diluted halo - may alter the merger outcome. Scenarios with a dark matter core tend to exhibit a higher probability of prompt collapse, while those with a dark matter halo develop a common envelope, embedding the whole binary. Furthermore, gravitational wave signals from mergers with dark matter halo configurations exhibit significant deviations from standard models when the tidal deformability is calculated in a two-fluid framework. This highlights the need for refined models in calculating the tidal deformability when considering mergers with extended dark matter structures. These initial results provide a basis for further exploration of dark matter's role in binary neutron star mergers and their associated gravitational wave emission and can serve as a benchmark for future observations from advanced detectors and multi-messenger astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 In our Bayesian and Statistical Analysis investigation of the open cluster NGC 6416, we utilized Gaia EDR3 astrometry data and ensemble-based unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify 406 cluster members. Using the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) with Gaia EDR3 data, we determined the following parameters for NGC 6416: a distance of approximately 1021pc, an age of about $12.58\pm 0.1$ Myr, a metallicity (z) of roughly $0.032\pm0.0015$, a binarity fraction near $0.419\pm0.021$, and an extinction ($A_V$) of approximately $0.995\pm0.058$ mag for an $R_V$ value of around $3.064\pm0.102$. We also fitted the radial surface density profile and conducted orbit analysis of the cluster using galpy. And finally found that the star formation scenarios are not observed in the open star cluster NGC 6416.

 - **Abstract**
 We present numerical simulations of discrete relativistic ejecta from an X-ray binary (XRB) with initial conditions directly informed by observations. XRBs have been observed to launch powerful discrete plasma ejecta during state transitions, which can propagate up to parsec distances. Understanding these ejection events unveils new understanding of jet-launching, jet power, and jet-ISM interaction among other implications. Multi-frequency quasi-simultaneous radio observations of ejecta from the black hole XRB MAXI J1820+070 produced both size and calorimetry constraints, which we use as initial conditions of a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation. We qualitatively reproduce the observed deceleration of the ejecta in a homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM). Our simulations demonstrate that the ejecta must be denser than the ISM, the ISM be significantly low-density, and the launch be extremely powerful, in order to propagate to the observed distances. The blob propagates and clears out a high-pressure low-density cavity in its wake, providing an explanation for this pre-existing low-density environment, as well as 'bubble-like' environments in the vicinity of XRBs inferred from other studies. As the blob decelerates, we observe the onset of instabilities and a long-lived reverse shock -- these mechanisms convert kinetic to internal energy in the blob, responsible for in-situ particle acceleration. We transform the outputs of our simulation into pseudo-radio images, incorporating the u,v coverage of the MeerKAT and e-MERLIN telescopes from the original observations with real-sky background. Through this, we maximize the interpretability of the results and provide direct comparison to current data, as well as provide prediction capabilities.
#### A Novel Method of Modeling Extended Emission of Compact Jets: Application to Swift J1727.8-1613

 - **Abstract**
 Flat radio spectra of compact jets launched by both supermassive and stellar-mass black holes are explained by an interplay of self-absorbed synchrotron emission up to some distance along the jet and optically thin synchrotron at larger distances (Blandford & Konigl 1979). Their spatial structure is usually studied using core shifts, in which the position of the peak (core) of the emission depends on the frequency. Here, we propose a novel method to fit the spatial dependence of the flux density at a given frequency of the jet and counterjet (when observed) using the theoretical spatial dependencies, which we provide as simple analytical formulae. We apply our method to the spatial structure of the jets in the luminous hard spectral state of the black-hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8--1613. It was the most resolved continuous jet from an X-ray binary ever observed. We find that the observed approaching jet is significantly intrinsically stronger than the receding one, which we attribute to an increase in the emission of both jets with time (observationally confirmed), together with the light travel effect, causing the receding jet to be observed at an earlier epoch than the approaching one. The jets are relatively slow, with the velocity $\sim(0.3$--$0.4)c$. Our findings imply that the magnetic field strength increased with time. Also, the magnetic flux is much lower than in jets launched by `Magnetically Arrested Disks'. Our method is general, and we propose that it be applied to jets launched by stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.
