 - **Abstract**
 We present Data Release 6 of ThrUMMS, consisting of complete data cubes and various moments of line emission ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O) from molecular clouds, across 60$^{\circ}$$\times$2$^{\circ}$ of the Fourth Quadrant (4Q) of the Milky Way at a resolution of 72$''$ in (l,b) and 0.09 kms$^{-1}$ in V$_{LSR}$. From LTE radiative transfer analysis of the data cubes, we compute cubes and moments of the lines' opacity, excitation temperature, and column density $N_{12CO}$. Combining $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$ data, we derive a global mass conversion law $N$=$N_{0}I^{p}$, where $N_{0}$$\approx$10$^{18}$mol/m$^{2}$ and $p$=2 at this resolution. We argue that the standard linear $N$=$XI$ is only approximately valid: $p$$\sim$1.5-1.0 at coarser resolutions or in atypical locations, such as Galactic Center clouds. Also, the velocity dispersion distributions are very different between $I_{12CO}$ and $N_{12CO}$, the former preferentially tracing more diffuse molecular gas. We re-evaluated Galactic rotation parameters for the 4Q, defining a new ``BGT'' model, and deprojected the (l,V) data onto (l,d) and (x,y) grids using standard kinematic procedures. To automate distance disambiguation inside the solar circle, we developed a simple $\zeta^{+}$ discriminator function and applied it to our deprojections. We discovered two previously unrecognised features of the molecular cloud population: widespread ripples in the midplane of wavelength 4kpc and amplitude 50pc, potentially generated by the last perigalactic passage of the Sgr dwarf; and three distant, massive molecular structures, the Far Ara clouds, two of which exhibit an exceptional velocity gradient, possibly arising in a massive spiral feather or a gas-rich dwarf galaxy $\sim$20--300kpc beyond the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Merging our supernova code F{\sc{ornax}} with the Box3D fast-flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, we explore the effects of fast-flavor conversion (FFC) in state-of-the-art 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova simulations. We find that after a few tens of milliseconds after bounce the FFC emerges just interior to and exterior to the stalled shock wave. It does not obtain in the PNS core nor near the average neutrinosphere radii. Interior to the shock, this results in a temporary change in the net neutrino heating rate of $\sim$10\%, due mostly to a hardening of the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrino spectra, despite the decrease in their corresponding neutrino number fluxes. In 1D, the hydrodynamic effects are not large, with increases in the stalled shock radius by of order ten to twenty kilometers that abate within a few hundred milliseconds. In 2D, the hydrodynamic effect of the FFC is a bit more noticeable, resulting in slightly earlier explosions for models for lower-mass progenitors, but also potentially inhibiting explosions for some higher-mass progenitors. Fast-flavor conversion continues to operate at larger radii at later times. The net result is a shift upward in the $\nu_{\mu}$ energy and number luminosities and a shift downward in the same quantities for both the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos. There seems to be a trend at very large radii and later times towards partial species and spectral equipartition. If this is true, it could be an interesting feature of supernova neutrino detection at later times in underground and under-ice facilities.
#### oMEGACat. VI. Analysis of the overall kinematics of Omega Centauri in 3D: velocity dispersion, kinematic distance, anisotropy, and energy equipartition

 - **Abstract**
 Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster and is likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. In this paper, we analyze $\omega$ Cen's kinematics using data from oMEGACat, a comprehensive catalog of $\omega$ Cen's central regions, including 1.4 million proper motion measurements and 300,000 spectroscopic radial velocities. Our velocity dispersion profiles and kinematic maps are consistent with previous work but improve on their resolution, precision, and spatial coverage. The cluster's 3D dispersion is isotropic in the core, with increasing radial anisotropy at larger radii. The 2D kinematic maps show an elongation of the velocity dispersion field comparable to the flattening observed photometrically. We find good agreement between proper motions and line-of-sight velocity dispersion and measure a kinematic distance of 5494$\pm$61 pc, the most precise kinematic distance to $\omega$ Cen available. The subset of data with precise metallicity measurements shows no correlation between metallicity and kinematics, supporting the picture of well-mixed stellar populations within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. Finally, we study the degree of energy equipartition using a large range of stellar masses. We find partial energy equipartition in the center that decreases towards large radii. The spatial dependence of the radial energy equipartition is stronger than the tangential energy equipartition. Our kinematic observations can serve as a new reference for future dynamical modeling efforts that will help to further disentangle the complex mass distribution within $\omega$ Cen.
#### Discovery of a pair of very metal-poor stars enriched in neutron-capture elements: The proto-disk r-II star BPS CS 29529-0089 and the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus r-I star TYC 9219-2422-1

 - **Abstract**
 R-process enhanced metal-poor stars (\EuFe$\geq+0.3$ and \FeH$\leq-1.0$) are rare objects whose study can provide clues to the astrophysical sites of the rapid neutron capture process. In this study, we investigate the detailed chemical abundance patterns of two of these anomalous stars, originally identified among stars observed by the GALAH survey. Our aim is to obtain the detailed chemical abundance pattern of these stars with spectroscopy at higher resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We use a calibration of the infrared flux method to determine accurate effective temperatures, and \Gaia~ parallaxes together with broadband photometry and theoretical bolometric corrections to determine surface gravity. Metallicities and chemical abundances are determined with model atmospheres and spectrum synthesis. We also integrate stellar orbits for a complete chemodynamic analysis. e determine abundances for up to 47 chemical species (44 elements), of which 27 are neutron-capture elements. Corrections because of deviations from the local thermodynamical equilibrium are applied to the metallicities and 12 elements. We find that one of the stars, BPS CS 29529-0089, is a proto-disk star of the Milky Way of r-II type, with \EuFe=+1.79~dex. The second star, TYC 9219-2422-1, is part of the halo and associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger event. It is of r-I type with [Eu/Fe] = +0.54. Abundances of Th are also provided for both stars. BPS CS 29529-0089 is the most extreme example of r-process enhanced star known with disk-like kinematics and that is not carbon enhanced. TYC 9219-2422-1 is found to be an archetypal Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star. Their abundances of C, Mg, Ni, Sc, Mn, and Al seem consistent with expectations for stars enriched by a single population III core collapse supernova, despite their relatively high metallicities ([Fe/H] $\sim$ $-$2.4).

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic field morphology of relativistic jets can be studied with circular polarization (CP). Recent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations coupled with radiative transfer calculations make strong predictions about the level (and morphology) of the jet's CP emission. These simulations show that the sign of CP and the electric vector position angle (EVPA) are both sensitive to the jet's magnetic field morphology within the radio core. We probe this theory by exploring if the jet's radio core EVPA orientation is consistent with the observed sign of the core CP in deep full-track polarimetric observations. We aim to probe the nature of linear polarization and CP in the innermost regions of jets from a small sample of nine blazars. This sample includes sources that have exhibited: (i) positive CP, (ii) negative CP, or (iii) positive & negative CP simultaneously in the radio core region. Nine blazar sources were observed using the VLBA at both 15 GHz and 23 GHz. Our self-calibration relies on a physically based model applied in DoG-HiT resulting in more accurate gains. We consider compact Stokes V structures instead of assuming it to be zero, which is crucial given the significant non-zero CP fraction observed at long baselines. We observe robust, relatively high degrees of fractional circular polarization m_c=(0.32 +- 0.2)% at 15 GHz and m_c=(0.59 +-0.56)% at 23 GHz. We observe consistent polarized structure and EVPA orientation over time when comparing our analysis with archival MOJAVE data. Theoretical predictions indicate a clear favored toroidal magnetic field orientation within the extended jet emission of the reconstructed signal of the blazar 0149+218. The jet structures of 1127-145 and 0528+134, even in superresolution, exhibit characteristics aligned with helical or poloidal magnetic nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.
#### SN 2024iss: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Implications for a Yellow Supergiant Progenitor

 - **Abstract**
 We report the multi-band photometric observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2024iss with ultra-violet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths starting one day after the explosion. The UV and optical light curves show the first peak two days after the explosion date. Following a first peak, a secondary maximum is observed in the optical and NIR bands, similar to SNe IIb with double-peaked light curves. The quasi-bolometric light curve shows the fast decay until a week after the explosion. From the analysis of the bolometric light curve, the ejecta mass and kinetic energy are estimated to be $M_{ej}=2.8\pm0.6~M_{\odot}$ and $E_{kin}=9.4\pm4.1\times10^{50}$ erg. The mass of the radioactive $^{56}$Ni is estimated to be $M(^{56}Ni)=0.2~M_{\odot}$. Fitting a black-body function to the spectral energy distribution reveals that the photospheric temperature exhibits a rapid exponential decline during the first week after the explosion. An analytic model describing the cooling emission after shock breakout provides a reasonable explanation for the observed temperature evolution. From these ejecta parameters, we calculated the progenitor radius to be $R_{pro}=50-340$~$R_{\odot}$. We conclude that these explosion properties are consistent with a core-collapse explosion from a yellow supergiant (YSG) progenitor.

 - **Abstract**
 We have observed the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH $5_1-4_1$ A$^+$, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH $14_1-13_2$ A$^-$, and CH$_2$DOH $8_{2,6}-8_{1,7}$ $e_0$ lines toward 24 high-mass star-forming regions by using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with an angular resolution of about 0$^{\prime\prime}$.3. This resolution corresponds to a linear scale of 400-1600 au, allowing us to resolve individual cores properly. We detected the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and CH$_2$DOH emission near the continuum peaks in many of these regions. From the two $^{13}$CH$_3$OH lines, we calculated the temperature toward the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH peaks, and confirm that the emission traces hot ($>$100 K) regions. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in the observed high-mass star-forming regions is found to be lower than that in low-mass star-forming regions. We have found no correlation between the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{13}$CH$_3$OH) or $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratios and either temperatures or distance to the sources, and have also found a source-to-source variation in these ratios. Our model calculations predict that the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in hot cores depends on the duration of the cold phase; the shorter the cold phase, the lower the deuterium fractionation in the hot cores. We have suggested that the lower $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in high-mass star-forming regions compared to that in low-mass star-forming regions is due to the shorter duration of the cold phase and that the diversity in the $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$($^{12}$CH$_3$OH) ratio in high-mass star-forming regions is due to the diversity in the length of the cold prestellar phase, and not the time that the objects have been in the hot core phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out an imaging survey of six globular clusters (GCs) with a limit magnitude to 22 mag at the 5 sigma level, down to the main sequence stars of the respective cluster, as one of the pilot observing program of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). This paper present the early results of this survey, where we investigate the tidal characters at the periphery of the clusters NGC 4147, NGC 5024, NGC 5053, NGC 5272, NGC 5904 and NGC 6341. We present the estimated number density of cluster candidates and their spatial distribution. We confirm the presence of tidal arms in NGC 4147 and NGC 5904 and identify several intriguing potential tidal structures in NGC 4147, NGC 5024, NGC 5272, corroborated the elliptical morphology of the periphery of NGC 6341. Our findings underscore the WFST's capability for probing faint structural features in GCs, paving the way for future in-depth studies, especially for the search of the large scale tidal streams associated with the clusters with the future wide field survey.

 - **Abstract**
 We acquired 450 {\mu}m and 850 {\mu}m dust continuum polarization observations toward the inner region of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) as part of the B-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These observations encompassed three dense structures: the 20 km s{^{-1}} cloud (20MC), 50 km s{^{-1}} cloud (50MC), and circumnuclear disk (CND). Our aim is to investigate the magnetic field morphology and strength in the inner region of the CMZ using polarized dust continuum and the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The magnetic field morphology is highly ordered in all three dense regions. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths are {\sim}1 mG for the 20MC and the 50MC, and {\sim}2 mG for the CND. We compare the energy contributions of turbulence, gravity, and thermal motion with that of the magnetic field using the plasma {\beta}, mass-to-flux ratio, and Alfvén Mach number. The outcomes reveal the magnetic field stands out as the predominant factor within the inner region of the CMZ. The dominance of the magnetic field may explain the low star-forming rate in the CMZ. We further investigate the dust grain alignment efficiency by exploring the relationship between polarization fraction and total intensity. The results suggest that dust grains are well aligned with the magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Fundamental questions about the physics responsible for fragmenting molecular parsec-scale clumps into cores of ~1000 au are still open, that only a statistically significant investigation with ALMA is able to address: what are the dominant agents that determine the core demographics, mass, and spatial distribution as a function of the physical properties of the hosting clumps, their evolutionary stage and the different Galactic environments in which they reside? To what extent extent is fragmentation driven by clumps dynamics or mass transport in filaments? With ALMAGAL we observed the 1.38 mm continuum and lines toward more than 1000 dense clumps in our Galaxy, with M>500M_sun, surface density > 0.1 g/cm2 and d<7.5 kpc. The ACA and two 12-m array setups were used to deliver a minimum resolution of ~1000 au over the entire sample distance range. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) to HII regions from the tip of the Galactic bar to the outskirts of the Galaxy. The spectral setup includes several molecular lines to trace the multiscale physics and dynamics of gas, notably CH3CN, H2CO, SiO, CH3OH, DCN, HC3N, SO etc. We present an initial overview of the observations and the early science product and results, with a first characterization of the morphological properties of the continuum emission. We use "perimeter-versus-area" and convex hull-versus-area metrics to classify the different morphologies. More extended and morphologically complex shapes are found toward clumps that are relatively more evolved and have higher surface densities.

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMAGAL Large Program has observed 1017 high-mass star-forming regions distributed throughout the Galaxy, sampling different evolutionary stages and environmental conditions. In this work, we present the acquisition and processing of the ALMAGAL data. The main goal is to set up a robust pipeline that generates science-ready products, with a good and uniform quality across the whole sample. ALMAGAL observations were performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Each field was observed in three different telescope arrays, being sensitive to spatial scales ranging from 1000 au up to 0.1 pc. The spectral setup allows sensitive imaging of the continuum emission at 219 GHz, and it covers multiple molecular spectral lines observed in four different spectral windows that span about 4 GHz in frequency coverage. We have designed a Python-based processing workflow to calibrate and image these observational data. This ALMAGAL pipeline includes an improved continuum determination, suited for line-rich sources; an automatic self-calibration process that improves the dynamical range of the final images; and the combination of data from different telescope arrays to produce science-ready, fully combined images. The fully combined products have spatial resolutions in the range 800-2000 au, and mass sensitivities in the range 0.02-0.07 Mo. We also present a first analysis of the spectral line information included in the ALMAGAL setup, and its potential for future scientific studies. As an example, specific spectral lines at 1000 au scales resolve the presence of multiple outflows in clusters and will help us to search for disk candidates around massive protostars. Moreover, the broad frequency bands provide information on the chemical richness of the different cluster members, which can be used to study the chemical evolution during the formation process of star clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 A planet's albedo is a fundamental property that sets its energy budget by dictating the fraction of incident radiation absorbed versus reflected back to space. Generally, optical eclipse observations have revealed the majority of hot, giant planets to have low albedos, indicating dayside atmospheres dominated by absorption instead of reflection. However, there are several exceptions to this rule, including the ultra-hot-Neptune LTT 9779b, which have been found to have high geometric albedos. We observed four eclipses of LTT 9779b with the G280 grism of the Hubble Space Telescope's WFC3 UVIS mode; targeting the scattering signatures of the cloud condensate species causing the planet's elevated reflectivity. However, we do not definitively detect the planet's eclipse in our observations, with injection-recovery tests yielding a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 113 ppm on the eclipse depth of LTT 9779b in the 0.2-0.8$\mu$m waveband. We create reflectance spectrum grids for LTT 9779b's dayside using VIRGA/PICASO and compare to our UVIS limit, as well as previously published CHEOPS and TESS eclipse photometry. We find that silicate condensates are best able to explain LTT 9779b's highly-reflective dayside. Our forward model grids only enable weak constraints on vertical mixing efficiency, and suggest that, regardless of their particular composition, the clouds are likely composed of smaller and more reflective particles. Our work facilitates a deeper understanding of the reflectance properties of LTT 9779b as well as the UVIS spectroscopic mode itself, which will remain the community's primary access to UV wavelengths until next-generation telescopes like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 The mechanisms behind the fragmentation of high-mass dense clumps into compact star-forming cores are fundamental topics in current astrophysical research. The ALMAGAL survey provides the opportunity to study this process at an unprecedented level of detail and statistical significance, featuring high-angular resolution $1.38$ mm ALMA observations of $1013$ massive dense clumps at various Galactic locations. These clumps cover a wide range of distances, masses, surface densities, and evolutionary stages. Here, we present the catalog of compact sources obtained with the CuTEx algorithm from continuum images of the full ALMAGAL clump sample combining ACA-$7$m and $12$m ALMA arrays, reaching a uniform high median spatial resolution of $\sim1400$ au. We discuss the fragmentation properties and the estimated physical parameters of the core population. The ALMAGAL compact source catalog includes $6348$ cores detected in $844$ clumps ($83\%$ of the total), with a number of cores per clump between $1$ and $49$ (median of $5$). The estimated core diameters are mostly within $\sim800-3000$ au (median of $1700$ au). We obtained core masses from $0.002$ to $345\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. We evaluated the variation in the core mass function (CMF) with evolution as traced by the clump $L/M$, finding a clear, robust shift and change in slope among CMFs within subsamples at different stages. This finding suggests that the CMF shape is not constant throughout the star formation process, but rather it builds (and flattens) with evolution, with higher core masses reached at later stages. We found that all cores within a clump grow in mass on average with evolution, and the number of cores increases with the core masses. Our results favor a clump-fed scenario for high-mass star formation, in which cores form as low-mass seeds, and then gain mass while further fragmentation occurs in the clump.
