#### $\texttt{bayes_spec}$: A Bayesian Spectral Line Modeling Framework for Astrophysics
 - **Authors:** Trey V. Wenger

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00924

 - **Abstract**
 $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is a Bayesian spectral line modeling framework for astrophysics. Given a user-defined model and a spectral line dataset, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ enables inference of the model parameters through different numerical techniques, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods, implemented in the PyMC probabilistic programming library. The API for $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is designed to support astrophysical researchers who wish to ``fit'' arbitrary, user-defined models, such as simple spectral line profile models or complicated physical models that include a full physical treatment of radiative transfer. These models are ``cloud-based'', meaning that the spectral line data are decomposed into a series of discrete clouds with parameters defined by the user's model. Importantly, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ provides algorithms to determine the optimal number of clouds for a given model and dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star-forming regions exhibit a rich chemistry with complex gas distributions, especially on small scales. While surveys have yielded constraints on typical gas conditions, they often have coarse spatial resolution and limited bandwidths. Thus, to establish an interpretative framework for these efforts, detailed observations that simultaneously provide high sensitivity, spatial resolution, and large bandwidths for a subset of diverse sources are needed. Here, we present wideband (32 GHz) Submillimeter Array observations of four high-mass star-forming regions (G28.20-0.05, G20.08-0.14 N, G35.58-0.03, W33 Main) at subarcsecond resolution, where we detect and spatially-resolve 100s of lines from over 60 molecules, including many complex organic molecules (COMs). The chemical richness of our sample is consistent with an evolutionary sequence from the line-rich hot cores and HC HII regions of G28.20-0.05 and G20.08-0.14 N to the more chemically-modest UC HII regions in G35.58-0.03, followed by the molecule-poor HII region W33 Main. We detect lines across a range of excitation conditions (Eu=20 to >800 K) and from numerous isotopologues, which enables robust estimates of gas properties. We derive nearly constant COM column density ratios that agree with literature values in other low- and high-mass protostellar cores, supporting the idea that COM abundances are set during the pre-stellar phase. In all regions, we identify spatial offsets among different molecular families, due to a combination of source physical structure and chemistry. In particular, we find potential evidence of carbon grain sublimation in G28.20-0.05 and identify an elemental oxygen gradient and rich sulfur-chemistry in G35.58-0.03. Overall, these results demonstrate that the SMA's wide bandwidth is a powerful tool to untangle the complex molecular gas structures associated with massive star formation.
#### Light Scattering Measurements of KCl Particles as an Exoplanet Cloud Analog

 - **Abstract**
 Salt clouds are predicted to be common on warm exoplanets, but their optical properties are uncertain. The Exoplanet Cloud Ensemble Scattering System (ExCESS), a new apparatus to measure the scattering intensity and degree of linear polarization (DOLP) for an ensemble of particles, is introduced here and used to study the light scattering properties of KCl cloud analogs. ExCESS illuminates particles with a polarized laser beam (532 nm) and uses a photomultiplier tube detector to sweep the plane of illumination. Scattering measurements for KCl particles were collected for three size distributions representative of modeled clouds for the warm exoplanet GJ 1214b. Our measurements show that Lorenz-Mie calculations, commonly used to estimate the light scattering properties of assumedly spherical cloud particles, offer an inaccurate depiction of cubic and cuboid shaped KCl particles. All of our measurements indicate that Lorenz-Mie scattering overestimates the backscattering intensity of our cloud analogs and incorrectly predicts the scattering at mid-phase angles (~90 degrees) and preferential polarization state of KCl scattered light. Our results align with the general scattering properties of non-spherical particles and underscore the importance of further understanding the effects that such particles will have on radiative transfer models of exoplanet atmospheres and reflected light observations of exoplanets by the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Habitable Worlds Observatory.
#### Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models (SPECTRUM) -- I: Updating radiative opacities for pulsation models of Classical Cepheid and RR-Lyrae

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsating stars are universally recognized as precise distance indicators and tracers of stellar populations. Their variability, combined with well-defined relationships between pulsation properties and intrinsic evolutionary parameters such as luminosity, mass, and age, makes them essential for understanding galactic evolution and retrieving star formation histories. Therefore, accurate modeling of pulsating stars is crucial for using them as standard candles and stellar population tracers. This is the first paper in the "Stellar Pulsation and Evolution: a Combined Theoretical Renewal and Updated Models" (SPECTRUM) project, which aims to present an update of Stellingwerf's hydrodynamical pulsation code, by adopting the latest radiative opacity tables commonly used in stellar evolution community. We assess the impact of this update on pulsation properties, such as periods, instability strip topology, and light curve shapes, as well as on Period Wesenheit and Period-Luminosity relations for Classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars, comparing the results with those derived using older opacity data. Our results indicate that the opacity update introduces only minor changes: instability strip boundary locations shift by no more than $100K$ in effective temperature, and pulsation periods vary within $1\sigma$ compared to previous evaluations. Light curves exhibit slight differences in shape and amplitude. Consequently, the theoretical calibration of the Cepheid or RRL-based extragalactic distance scale remains largely unaffected by the opacity changes. However, achieving consistency in opacity tables between stellar evolution and pulsation codes is a significant step toward a homogeneous and self-consistent stellar evolution and pulsation framework.
#### The X-ray re-brightening of GRB afterglow revisited: a possible signature from activity of the central engine

 - **Abstract**
 Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to be from core collapse of massive stars, and a rapidly spinning magnetar or black hole may be formed as the central engine. The extended emission in the prompt emission, flares and plateaus in X-ray afterglow, are proposed to be as the signature of central engine re-activity. However, the directly evidence from observations of identifying the central engines remain an open question. In this paper, we systemically search for long-duration GRBs that consist of bumps in X-ray afterglow detected by Swift/XRT, and find that the peak time of the X-ray bumps exhibit bimodal distribution (defined as early and late bumps) with division line at $t=7190$ s. Although we cannot rule out that such a bimodality arises from selection effects. We proposed that the long-duration GRBs with an early (or late) bumps may be originated from the fall-back accretion onto a new-born magnetar (or black hole). By adopting MCMC method to fit the early (or late) bumps of X-ray afterglow with the fall-back accretion of magnetar (or black hole), it is found that the initial surface magnetic filed and period of magnetars for most early bumps are clustered around $5.88\times10^{13}$ G and $1.04$ ms, respectively. Meanwhile, the derived accretion mass of black hole for late bumps is range of $[4\times10^{-4}, 1.8\times10^{-2}]~M_{\odot}$, and the typical fall-back radius is distributed range of $[1.04, 4.23]\times 10^{11}$ cm which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf-Rayet star. However, we also find that the fall-back accretion magnetar model is disfavored by the late bumps, but the fall-back accretion of black hole model can not be ruled out to interpret the early bumps of X-ray afterglow.
#### Intergalactic magnetism in a gamma-ray beam as a model of Porphyrion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01640

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the magnetic field in the jets of the recently discovered 7 Mpc long Porphyrion system. We use non-detection of the system in gamma-rays to derive a lower bound on the co-moving magnetic field strength at the level of ~10 nG. This value is consistent with recent estimates of magnetic fields in the filaments of the Large Scale Structure. We discuss the possibility that, instead of being the extreme case of a radio jet formation scenario, Porphyrion actually traces a very-high-energy gamma-ray beam emitted by an active galactic nucleus. In such a model, jets do not need to spread into the voids of the Large Scale Structure to appear straight on a very large distance range, and several anomalies of the standard radio jet scenarios can be solved at once.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 850 $\mu$m polarization observations of the IC 348 star-forming region in the Perseus molecular cloud as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observation (BISTRO) survey. We study the magnetic properties of two cores (HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS) and a filamentary structure of IC 348. We find that the overall field tends to be more perpendicular than parallel to the filamentary structure of the region. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity, and we estimate the trend by power-law and the mean of the Rice distribution fittings. The power indices for the cores are much smaller than 1, indicative of possible grain growth to micron size in the cores. We also measure the magnetic field strengths of the two cores and the filamentary area separately by applying the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and its alternative version for compressed medium. The estimated mass-to-flux ratios are 0.45-2.20 and 0.63-2.76 for HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS, respectively, while the ratios for the filament is 0.33-1.50. This result may suggest that the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions occurs at the core scale ($\sim$ 0.05 pc) in the region. In addition, we study the energy balance of the cores and find that the relative strength of turbulence to the magnetic field tends to be stronger for IC 348 MMS than HH 211 MMS. The result could potentially explain the different configurations inside the two cores: a single protostellar system in HH 211 MMS and multiple protostars in IC 348 MMS.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of volume-limited samples of magnetic white dwarfs (WD) have revealed a higher incidence of magnetism in older WDs. Specifically, these studies indicate that magnetism is more prevalent in WDs with fully or partially crystallized cores compared to those with entirely liquid cores. This has led to the recognition of a crystallization-driven dynamo as an important mechanism for explaining magnetism in isolated WDs. However, recent simulations challenged the capability of this mechanism to match both the incidence of magnetism and the field strengths detected in WDs. In this letter, we explore an alternative hypothesis for the surface emergence of magnetic fields in isolated WDs. WDs with masses $\gtrsim 0.55 M_\odot$ are the descendants of main-sequence stars with convective cores capable of generating strong dynamo magnetic fields. This idea is supported by asteroseismic evidence of strong magnetic fields buried within the interiors of red giant branch stars. Assuming that these fields are disrupted by subsequent convective zones, we have estimated magnetic breakout times for WDs. Due to the significant uncertainties in breakout times stemming from the treatment of convective boundaries and mass loss rates, we cannot provide a precise prediction for the emergence time of the main-sequence dynamo field. However, we can predict that this emergence should occur during the WD phase for WDs with masses $\gtrsim 0.65 M_\odot$. We also find that the magnetic breakout is expected to occur earlier in more massive WDs, consistently with observations from volume-limited samples and the well-established fact that magnetic WDs tend to be more massive than non-magnetic ones. Moreover, within the uncertainties of stellar evolutionary models, we find that the emergence of main-sequence dynamo magnetic fields can account for a significant portion of the magnetic WDs.

 - **Abstract**
 Whether considering rare astrophysical events on cosmological scales or unresolved stellar populations, accurate models must account for the integrated contribution from the entire history of star formation upon which that population is built. Here, we describe the second version of POSYDON, an open-source binary population synthesis code based on extensive grids of detailed binary evolution models computed using the MESA code, which follows both stars' structures as a binary system evolves through its complete evolution from the zero-age main sequence, through multiple phases of mass transfer and supernovae, to their death as compact objects. To generate synthetic binary populations, POSYDON uses advanced methods to interpolate between our large, densely spaced grids of simulated binaries. In our updated version of POSYDON, we account for the evolution of stellar binaries across a cosmological range of metallicities, extending from $10^{-4}\,Z_{\odot}$ to $2\,Z_{\odot}$, including grids specifically focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds ($0.2\,Z_{\odot}$ and $0.45\,Z_{\odot}$). In addition to describing our model grids and detailing our methodology, we outline several improvements to POSYDON. These include the incorporation of single stars in stellar populations, a treatment for stellar mergers, and a careful modeling of "reverse-mass transferring" binaries, in which an once-accreting star later becomes a donor star. Our simulations are focused on binaries with at least one high-mass component, such as those that host neutron stars and black holes, and we provide post-processing methods to account for the cosmological evolution of metallicity and star formation as well as rate calculations for gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other transients.
