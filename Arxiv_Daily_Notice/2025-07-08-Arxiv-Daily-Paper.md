 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs represent the most common end stage of stellar evolution and are important for a range of astrophysical questions. The high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capability of the Habitable World Observatory (HWO) offers a unique capability to characterize white dwarfs. In this documents, we focus on two specific science cases for HWO -- white dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions, and fundamental astrophysics. HWO will have the sensitivity to measure a suite of heavy elements, such as S, C, O, Fe, and Si, in a large sample of polluted white dwarfs to constrain the water content and the light elements in the cores of extrasolar planets. HWO can also be used to search for any small variation on the fine structure constant in the presence of strong gravity. Both science cases require a minimum resolving power of 60,000, and a ultraviolet coverage down to at least 900 Angstrom.

 - **Abstract**
 The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) offers a unique opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. The goal of this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) is to investigate the physical and chemical processes that shape the composition and atmospheric mass loss in exoplanets. We review the key observables currently known as diagnostics of mass loss via transit observations, i.e., absorption lines of escaping hydrogen (Lyman-alpha), helium, and metals (Fe, Mg, C, O). We also explore the challenges to infer planetary formation processes based on atmospheric composition characterization. HWO could enable a broad, continuous coverage from far-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectroscopy (~100--1600 nm) at high resolution (R > 60, 000), which is essential to make these measurements, disentangle their planetary origin from stellar activity, and ultimately, contextualize the escape rates by simultaneously characterizing the composition, cloud predominance, and thermal structure of exoplanet atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Seismic structure inversions have been used to study the solar interior for decades. With the high-precision frequencies obtained using data from the Kepler mission, it has now become possible to study other solar-like oscillators using structure inversions, including both main-sequence and subgiant stars. Subgiant stars are particularly interesting because they exhibit modes of mixed acoustic-buoyancy nature, which provide the opportunity to probe the deeper region of stellar cores. This work examines whether the structure inversion techniques developed for the pure acoustic modes of the Sun and other main-sequence stars are still valid for mixed modes observed in subgiant stars. We construct two grids of models: one of main-sequence stars and one of early subgiant stars. Using these grids, we examine two different parts of the inversion procedure. First, we examine what we call the "kernel errors", which measure how well the mode sensitivity functions can recover known frequency differences between two models. Second, we test how these kernel errors affect the ability of an inversion to infer known structure differences. On the main sequence, we find that reliable structure inversion results can be obtained across the entire range of masses and large frequency separations we consider. On the subgiant branch, however, the rapid evolution of mixed modes leads to large kernel errors and hence difficulty recovering known structure differences. Our tests show that using mixed modes to infer the structure of subgiant stars reliably will require improvements to current fitting approaches and modifications to the structure inversion techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.
#### Crowded Field Photometry with Rubin: Exploring 47 Tucanae with Data Preview 1

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze imaging from Data Preview 1 of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to explore the performance of early LSST pipelines in the 47 Tucanae field. The coadd-\texttt{object} catalog demonstrates the depth and precision possible with Rubin, recovering well-defined color magnitude diagrams for 47 Tuc Small Magellanic Cloud. Unfortunately, the existing pipelines fail to recover sources within $\sim$28 pc of the cluster center, due to the extreme source density. Using Rubin's forced photometry on stars identified via Difference Imaging, we can recover sources down to $\sim$14 pc from the cluster center, and find 14744 potential cluster members with this extended dataset. While this forced photometry has significant systematics, our analysis showcases the potential for detailed structural studies of crowded fields with the Rubin Observatory.
#### Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7} M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.
#### Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.

 - **Abstract**
 The symbiotic channel of Type Ia supernovae progenitors is crucial for explaining the observed circumstellar material in some Type Ia supernovae. While extensive numerical and observational efforts have been dedicated to exploring the progenitor system, limited emphasis has been placed on studying the surviving companions arising from the symbiotic channel. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the symbiotic systems using {\tt MESA} as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. We conduct 1260 binary stellar evolution simulations, over a wide range of parameters, incorporating the optically thick wind model developed by Hachisu et al., and predict the post-impact evolution of these surviving companions. We classify four types of progenitor systems based on the evolutionary stage of the companion at the onset of the explosion: red giant companions, with or without prior helium flash events, and asymptotic giant branch companions, with or without the thermal pulsing phase. After the SN impact, a blue dwarf star with either a helium or carbon-oxygen core is left behind. However, if a small portion of the envelope ($\gtrsim$ 0.3\%) remains on the core of the surviving companion, the overall post-supernova evolution may remain similar to its pre-explosion state, albeit slightly fainter, making observation a challenging endeavor.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays, originating from stars, supernovae, and other astrophysical sources, are composed of high-energy particles that enter Earths atmosphere. Upon interaction with atmospheric nuclei, these primary cosmic rays generate secondary particles, including neutrons, electrons, and muons, with muons constituting a dominant component at ground level. Muons, due to their relative abundance, stability, and well-characterized energy loss mechanisms, serve as critical probes for investigating the fundamental properties of cosmic rays. Studies of muon energy distribution, diurnal anisotropy, and their modulation by solar activity provide critical insights into the mechanism of particle acceleration in cosmic ray sources and the effects of solar and this http URL study aims to characterize the counting spectra and anisotropic properties of cosmic ray muons by using a plastic scintillator detector system. The experiment was conducted over a three-month period, from December 2023 to February 2024, leveraging long-bar plastic scintillator detectors equipped with dual-end photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and a high-resolution digital data acquisition system. A dual-end coincidence measurement technique was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing thermal noise and other background interferences. Diurnal variations in muon count rates exhibit a pronounced pattern, with a systematic reduction occurring between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM. This phenomenon is attributed to the solar shielding effects, where enhanced solar activity during daytime hours modulates the flux of galactic cosmic rays reaching Earths surface. The study further corroborates these findings through cross-comparisons with data from the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory. These observations underscore the robustness of the plastic scintillator detector system for capturing detailed muon spectra and anisotropic patterns.
#### FEAST: probing the stellar population of the starburst dwarf galaxy NGC4449 with JWST/NIRCam

 - **Abstract**
 We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the starburst irregular galaxy NGC 4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic Star clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar populations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude diagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different evolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial distributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped distribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 - 60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent with the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have triggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable ages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field stars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented high-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap between Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the presence of a massive AGB star "finger". The analysis of these stars can provide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy. These results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf starburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation and underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in nearby starburst systems.
#### Thermochemical models of outer core convection with heterogeneous core-mantle boundary heat flux

 - **Abstract**
 Thermochemical convection in Earth's outer core is driven by the crystallisation of the inner core that releases latent heat and light elements. A key question in core dynamics is whether a stable layer exists just below the core-mantle boundary. Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB heterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses, RILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to coexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of thermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman number ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers $\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and chemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical models reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in either locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the strength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in our thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The addition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven by thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have varying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or chemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs are O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with the strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the strength of chemical driving. Our simulations reveal a diverse range of possible stable regions and/or a global layer at the top of Earth's core, with a seismically plausible range of thickness and strength, which may also have a signature in geomagnetic observations.
#### The late Miocene $^{10}$Be anomaly and the possibility of a supernova

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3, we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional $^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.

 Context. The dust and gas temperature in proto-planetary disks play critical roles in determining their chemical evolution and influencing planet formation processes. Aims. We attempted an accurate measurement of the dust and CO temperature profile in the edge-on disk of the Flying Saucer. Methods. We used the unique properties of the Flying Saucer, its edge-on geometry and its fortunate position in front of CO clouds with different brightness temperatures to provide independent constraints on the dust temperature. We compared it with the dust temperature derived using the radiative transfer code DiskFit and the CO gas temperature. Results. We find clear evidence for a substantial gas temperature vertical gradient, with a cold (10 K) disk mid-plane and a warmer CO layer where T(r) is 27 K at 100 au, dropping with exponent 0.3. Direct evidence for CO depletion in the mid-plane, below about 1 scale height, is also found. At this height, the gas temperature is 15-20 K, consistent with the expected CO freeze out temperature. The dust disk appears optically thin at 345 GHz, and exhibits moderate settling.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how the dynamical state of the interstellar medium (ISM) changes across spatial scales can provide important insights into how the gas is organized and ultimately collapses to form stars. To this end, we present ALMA $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(2-1)$ observations at $7$ pc ($0.4''$) spatial resolution across a $1.4~\mathrm{kpc}\times5.6~\mathrm{kpc}$ ($1'.3\times1'.3$) region located in the disk of the nearby ($D = 3.5$ Mpc), massive, star-forming galaxy NGC 253. We decompose this emission with a hierarchical, multiscale dendrogram algorithm to identify 2463 structures with deconvolved sizes ranging from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of $10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately, we do not identify any emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we find a correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These findings suggest that gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular clouds and emphasize the need for multiscale approaches to characterize the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of tidal forces in molecular cloud formation by examining how apparent boundedness, as diagnosed by the classical virial parameter, relates to the actual gravitational state of clouds subject to tidal forces from their environment. Clouds are identified by a dendrogram algorithm in zoom-in regions taken from a simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with the Voronoi mesh code AREPO that resolves star-forming regions at sub-parsec resolution. To look at a range of environments, we use data from three different regions that evolve differently in the center, near the equivalent of the Solar circle, and the outskirts of the modeled galaxy, at three different times, each spaced 2 Myr apart. We compute the importance of tidal forces on all identified clouds. We then compare the boundedness of clouds including only their internal potentials to boundedness also including the external gravitational potential. This comparison shows that tidal forces can unbind apparently bound clouds and bind apparently unbound clouds. We characterize the cloud population by comparing their virial parameters to their surface densities, finding the ratio of the maximum to the minimum eigenvalues of the tidal tensor, and determining the strength of gravitational instability in each examined region. We find that it is necessary to take the total gravitational potential into account rather than just the internal self-gravity of the clouds to have an accurate understanding of cloud dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Our Earth, being the only living planet that we know, provides us with clues that photosynthetic life-forms may be dominant on other exoplanets for billions of years. Spectropolarimetric signatures of the terrestrial photosynthetic life (PSLife) are well studied in the lab and remotely sensed with space and airborne instrumentation. An astonishing biosignature revealed by these measurements is an extremely strong linear polarization (tens \%) associated with broad absorption bands of biological pigments (biopigments) driving photosynthesis in various organisms. Also, unique circular-polarization signatures are associated with biopigments and other complex macromolecules as a sign of homochirality which is ubiquitous in terrestrial life forms. Thus, low-resolution spectro- or multi-band polarimetry of exoplanets directly imaged at an unprecedented contrast using the HWO coronagraph is a novel opportunity for a robust discovery of life on exoplanets. Here we propose to carry out two surveys and two follow-up observing programs. Survey 1 will identify potentially habitable planets (PHPs) through detection of atmospheres, clouds and liquid surface water (ocean) using linear polarimetry. Survey 2 will identify Living World (LW) candidates among PHPs by searching for strong linear polarization signatures associated with strong and broad absorption bands reminiscent of terrestrial biopigments. Follow-up program 3 will obtain multi-color surface maps of LWs, determine the distribution and abundance of alien photosynthetic organisms with exo-biopigments (exoBPs) and correlate their properties with the atmospheric and surface compositions. Follow-up program 4 will employ circular polarization to verify homochirality of exoBPs. This comprehensive approach aims at providing a quantitative answer to the ultimate question "Are we are alone in the Universe?".

 - **Abstract**
 A proper modelling of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate within gas clouds is crucial to describe their chemical evolution accurately. However, this modelling is computationally demanding because it requires the propagation of cosmic rays throughout the cloud over time. We present a more efficient approach that simultaneously guarantees a reliable estimate of the cosmic-ray impact on the chemistry of prestellar cores. We introduce a numerical framework that mimics the cosmic-ray propagation within gas clouds and applies it to magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the code GIZMO. It simulates the cosmic-ray attenuation by computing the effective column density of H$_2$ that is traversed, which is estimated using the same kernel weighting approach as employed in the simulation. The obtained cosmic-ray ionisation rate is then used in post-processing to study the chemical evolution of the clouds. We found that cosmic-ray propagation affects deuterated and non-deuterated species significantly and that it depends on the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. We explored correlations between the electron abundance, the cosmic-ray ionisation rate, and the abundance of the most relevant ions (HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and o-H$_2$D$^+$), with the purpose of finding simple expressions that link them. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the ionisation fraction, X(e$^-$), from observable tracers and applied it to existing observations of high-mass clumps. We obtained values of about 10$^{-8}$, which is in line with previous works and with expectations for dense clouds. We also provide a linear fit to calculate the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from the local H$_2$ density, which is to be employed in three-dimensional simulations that do not include cosmic-ray propagation.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the merger rate density history of binary neutron stars (BNS) can greatly aid in understanding the history of heavy element formation in the Universe. Currently, second-generation Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors can only measure the BNS merger rate density history at low redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 0.1). Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) may trace the BNS merger to higher redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 3). However, not all BNS mergers result in sGRBs, and it is not certain that all sGRBs originate from BNS mergers. In this study, we simultaneously utilize simulated BNS merger GW signals detected by the advanced LIGO design and sGRB signals detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM to constrain the BNS merger rate density history up to $z$ $\sim$ 3. The results indicate that with $\sim$ 8 GWs and 571 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured with an accuracy of about 50\% through $z=0$ to $z=1$. The ratio of the jet opening angle-corrected sGRB event rate density to the BNS merger rate density, denoted as $\eta$, can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 45\%. With $\sim$ 21 GWs and 761 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured to approximately 35\% and 40\% at $z=0$ and $z=1$, respectively. Meanwhile, $\eta$ can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 28\%. Additionally, in our parameterized simulation, we find that at least approximately $\sim$550 sGRBs are needed to constrain the characteristic delay time in the star formation rate model, given a relative error of 50\% in the estimated redshift.
#### Resolving the origin of the unidentified TeV source HESS J1626-490 as a relic of the ancient cosmic-ray factory SNR G335.2+0.1

 - **Abstract**
 While decades of observations in the TeV gamma-ray band have revealed more than 200~sources with radio or X-ray counterparts, there remain dozens of unidentified TeV sources, which may provide crucial information of cosmic ray (CR) accelerators. HESS J1626$-$490 is an unidentified TeV gamma-ray source but is expected to originate from CRs that escaped from the nearby supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and are interacting with dense interstellar clouds. To test this scenario, we scrutinize the properties of the SNR and search for non-thermal counterparts by analyzing observational data in the radio, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands. From analysis of the H\,{\sc i} and $^{12}$CO ($J{=}1{-}0$) line data, we identify the cloud associated with the SNR and compare the morphologies of the cloud and the gamma-ray emission. The distance and age of the SNR are estimated to be $3.3 \pm 0.6$~kpc and ${\sim}5$~kyr, respectively. From X-ray and GeV gamma-ray data analyses, we find an extended GeV gamma-ray emission overlapping with the SNR and H.E.S.S. source regions but no X-ray emission. The location of the peak of the extended GeV emission changes from near the SNR at $\lesssim 1$~GeV to the H.E.S.S. source at $>10$~GeV. We find a spectral hardening at ${\sim}50$~GeV, which is consistent with the existence of two components in the gamma-ray emission. We find that a combination of emission from the escaped CRs and the SNR itself can reproduce the observed broadband spectrum, on the assumption that the SNR has accelerated protons to ${\gtrsim}100$~TeV in the past.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a deep neutral hydrogen (Hi) observation of the early-type galaxy NGC 2768 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Leveraging the high sensitivity of FAST, we discover an extended gas envelope around NGC 2768. The total Hi mass is measured to be 8.1 x 10^8 M_sun , representing a magnitude increase compared to previous Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) studies. Position-velocity (PV) diagram indicates the envelope mainly involves two components: an Hi disk of NGC 2768 and a newly discovered satellite galaxy without detectable counterparts in currently deep optical surveys. The center of the gas disk is mis-aligned with the optical disk of NGC 2768, with more gas redshifted, indicating it has been disturbed. Our study indicates NGC 2768 is currently undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0. Previous deep WSRT observations reveal two dense clumps (named as Clumps A and Clump B throughout this paper) in the center of the envelope. We find Clump A corresponds to the densest part of the disk, while Clump B might be a newly discovered satellite galaxy which probably collided NGC 2768 about 0.38 Gyr ago. We also find tidal interactions between Clump B and PGC 2599651, NGC 2768 and UGC 4808. Based on these new findings, we finally analyze hierarchical accretion history of NGC 2768.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 20 Milky Way (MW), 9 Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 7 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 12 M31, and 7 M33 (classical) Cepheids with periods longer than 50 days were constructed using photometric data from the literature and fitted with model atmospheres with the aim of identifying objects with an infrared excess. The SEDs were fitted with stellar photosphere models to derive the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature; a dust component was added when required. The distance and reddening values were taken from the literature. WISE and IRAC images were inspected to verify whether potential excess emission was related to the central objects. Only one star with a significant infrared (IR) excess was found in the LMC and none in the SMC, M31, and M33, contrary to earlier work on the MW suggesting that IR excess may be more prominent in MW Cepheids than in the Magellanic Clouds. One additional object in the MW was found to have an IR excess, but it is unclear whether it is a classical Cepheid or a type-{\sc ii} Cepheid. The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (HRD) and compared to evolutionary tracks for CCs and to theoretical instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is consistent with the instability strip. For stars in the MW uncertainties in the distance and reddening can significantly change their position in the HRD.

 - **Abstract**
 We determined the ortho/para (o/p) ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in the archetypical pre-stellar core L1544. The core was observed in the two lowest rotational lines of ortho- and para-NH2D using the APEX and the IRAM 30 m telescopes. The ground-state lines of ortho- and para-NHD2 were observed with APEX. The distributions of chemical abundances in the core were predicted using a gas-grain chemistry model with two different scenarios concerning proton transfer reactions in the gas. One of the scenarios, the so-called full scrambling (FS), allows protons and deuterons to be completely mixed in the intermediate reaction complex before dissociation, whereas the other describes these reactions as proton or deuteron hops (PH). We also tested assumed abundance profiles independent of the chemistry models. Radiative transfer calculations were used to simulate the observed NH2D and NHD2 lines from the predicted and assumed abundance profiles. Our modelling efforts suggest that the ground-state lines of NH2D and NHD2 at the wavelength 0.9 mm that are observable with the same beam and in the same spectrometer band are the most reliable probes of the o/p ratios. Simulations using the PH reaction scheme show systematically better agreement with the observations than simulations with the FS model. Simulations using a broken power law abundance profile as a function of the gas density give spin ratios that are close to the predictions of the PH scenario: o/p-NH2D=2.85+-0.05, o/p-NHD2=2.10+-0.06 (1 sigma). The o/p ratios predicted by the PH scenario in the gas phase correspond to the nuclear spin statistical weights, that is, o/p-NH2D=3, o/p-NHD2=2. In view of the fact that H and D atom addition reactions on grain surfaces also result in these ratios, it is reasonable to assume that the spin ratios of interstellar ammonia and its deuterated forms are in general equal to their statistical values.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization measurements provide strong constraints on magnetic fields in star-forming systems. While magnetic field estimates of a few kiloGauss (kG) have been obtained near the surface of low-mass protostars, there are no analogous measurements in the immediate vicinity of the surface of massive protostars. We report the measurement of radio continuum circular polarization (CP) towards a massive protostar IRAS 18162-2048 for the first time wielding Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations. The fractional CP varies between $3-5\%$ across the observed frequency range of $4-6$ GHz. We consider multiple hypotheses for the production of CP and propose (i) gyrosynchrotron emission and (ii) Faraday conversion due to turbulence in the magnetic medium - both driven by mildly relativistic electrons as plausible mechanisms. We estimate, for the first time, a magnetic field $B\gtrsim20-35$ G close to the massive protostar. The Lorentz factor of the low energy electrons is estimated to be in the range $\gamma_{min}\sim5-7$ for gyrosynchrotron emission and $80-100$ for Faraday conversion from our observations. The magnetic field estimate can provide important constraints to the formation models of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However, most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \texttt{Torch} framework, integrating the \texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into \texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics. We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total mass of $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$, investigating the effects of varying numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of $0.55\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters initially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile is consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than analytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models of local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly ejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends on the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall star formation timescale.

 We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. % Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS} evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. % Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.

 - **Abstract**
 Disc winds play a crucial role in many accreting astrophysical systems across all scales. In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism. However, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the ionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable physical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed, multi-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent radiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations produced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc < 1e-5 for our adopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of ionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4). One remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal outflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and explicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow. In the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not change the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new simulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows are too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions nor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions include wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral energy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms. With the physics now built into our simulations, we are well-equipped to also explore line-driven disc winds in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Juno and Cassini have shown that Jupiter and Saturn likely contain extended gradients of heavy elements. Yet, how these gradients can survive over billions of years remains an open question. Classical convection theories predict rapid mixing and homogenization, which would erase such gradients on timescales far shorter than the planets' ages. To address this, we estimate the energy required to erode both dense and fuzzy cores, and compare it to what the planet can realistically supply. If the entire cooling budget is available to drive mixing, then even a compact core can, in principle, be destroyed. But if mixing is limited to the thermal energy near the core, which is another plausible scenario, the energy falls short. In that case, Jupiter can erode a fuzzy core by up to approximately $10~\mearth$, but a compact one remains intact. Saturn's core is more robust. Even in the fuzzy case, only about $1~\mearth$ is lost, and if the core is compact, erosion is negligible. The outcome depends sensitively on the assumed initial temperature and entropy profiles. Hotter and more superadiabatic interiors are more prone to mixing. We suggest that 3D simulations of convection driven from above, with realistic stratification and enough depth (i.e., many density scale heights) would be of great interest to further constrain the energy budget for core erosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) are known to harbor disks at young ages. Here, we present 1-13 $\mu m$ spectra for eight young FFPMOs with masses of 5-10 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ (at ages of 1-5 Myr), using the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. We derive fundamental properties of these targets, and find spectral types of M9.5 to L4, with effective temperatures of 1600-1900 K. The photospheric spectra of our targets show a clear diversity at similar temperatures, especially in the 3-5 $\mu m$ range, unaccounted for by existing atmospheric models. We find a silicate absorption feature in the photosphere of one of our targets, the first such detection in very young FFPMOs, indicating silicate clouds in their cool atmospheres. Six of our objects show mid-infrared excess emission above the photosphere, as well as silicate emission features, demonstrating the presence of disks. The shape and strength of the latter features constitute strong evidence of grain growth and crystallization, similar to what is seen in more massive brown dwarfs and stars. We also detect emission lines from hydrocarbon molecules in the disks of several targets. These are the lowest mass isolated objects found so far with silicate and hydrocarbon emission features arising in their disks. The presence of disks and their characteristics point to the potential for the formation of rocky companions around free-floating planetary-mass objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\mu m$, WISE 12~$\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\HI} column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.
