#### Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Thorne-Żytkow Objects (TŻOs) have been predicted to form when a neutron star is engulfed by a diffuse, convective giant envelope. Accretion onto a neutron star at a rate that is larger than $10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is expected to lead to significant emission of neutrinos of all flavors with energy of 1-100 MeV. Since the neutrino signal is expected to largely vary in time (from milliseconds to thousands of years), we outline detection strategies tailored to the signal duration. We find that neutrino detection from TŻOs up to the Small Magellanic Cloud is within the reach of current- and next-generation neutrino observatories, such as Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and JUNO. Interestingly, if targeted searches for neutrinos from TŻO candidates (e.g. VX Sgr in our Galaxy as well as HV 2112 and HV 11417 in the Small Magellanic Cloud) should lead to positive results, neutrinos could positively identify the nature of such sources and their accretion rate. Our findings should serve as motivation for establishing dedicated searches for neutrino emission from TŻOs. This is especially timely since it is challenging to detect TŻOs via electromagnetic radiation unambiguously, and the TŻO gravitational wave signal could be probed with next-generation detectors for sources within our Galaxy only.
#### Multi-Wavelength Analysis of AT 2023sva: a Luminous Orphan Afterglow With Evidence for a Structured Jet

 - **Abstract**
 We present multi-wavelength analysis of ZTF23abelseb (AT 2023sva), an optically discovered fast-fading ($\Delta m_r = 2.2$ mag in $\Delta t = 0.74 $ days), luminous ($M_r \sim -30.0$ mag) and red ($g-r = 0.50$ mag) transient at $z = 2.28$ with accompanying luminous radio emission. AT 2023sva does not possess a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) counterpart to an isotropic equivalent energy limit of $E_{\rm{\gamma, \, iso}} < 1.6 \times 10^{52}$ erg, determined through searching $\gamma$-ray satellite archives between the last non-detection and first detection, making it the sixth example of an optically-discovered afterglow with a redshift measurement and no detected GRB counterpart. We analyze AT 2023sva's optical, radio, and X-ray observations to characterize the source. From radio analyses, we find the clear presence of strong interstellar scintillation (ISS) 72 days after the initial explosion, allowing us to place constraints on the source's angular size and bulk Lorentz factor. When comparing the source sizes derived from ISS of orphan events to those of the classical GRB population, we find orphan events have statistically smaller source sizes. We also utilize Bayesian techniques to model the multi-wavelength afterglow. Within this framework, we find evidence that AT 2023sva possesses a shallow power-law structured jet viewed slightly off-axis ($\theta_{\rm{v}} = 0.07 \pm 0.02$) just outside of the jet's core opening angle ($\theta_{\rm{c}} = 0.06 \pm 0.02$). We determine this is likely the reason for the lack of a detected GRB counterpart, but also investigate other scenarios. AT 2023sva's evidence for possessing a structured jet stresses the importance of broadening orphan afterglow search strategies to a diverse range of GRB jet angular energy profiles, to maximize the return of future optical surveys.
#### Recent star formation episodes in the Galaxy: impact on its chemical properties and the evolution of its abundance gradient

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disc exploring various schemes of recent (last several Gyr) star formation episodes, as reported in recent observational works. We use a semi-analytical model with parametrized radial migration and we introduce gaussian star formation episodes constrained by those recent observations. We find significant impact of the star formation episodes on several observables, like the local age-metallicity and [alpha/Fe] vs metallicity relations, as well as the local stellar metallicity distribution or the existence of young [alpha/Fe]-rich stars. Moreover, we show that the recently found "wiggly" behaviour of the disk abundance gradient with age can be interpreted in terms of either star formation or infall episodes.

 - **Abstract**
 Using multi-viewpoint observations from STEREO and SOHO during three solar cycles from 23 to 25, we study the magnetic flux rope (MFR) structures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) near the Sun and magnetic clouds (MCs) at 1au. The study aims to investigate two phenomena: 1) the occurrence rate of CMEs near Hale sector boundaries (HBs) and 2) solar-cycle variation of MFR axial orientations in CMEs and MCs. Our preliminary results include: 1) the axes of MFRs in cycle 25 present a systematic northward orientation, which is the same as in cycle 23 but opposite to cycle 24; 2) the majority of the MFRs occurred near HBs (within 30 degrees) and some exceptional events occurred at non-HBs; 3) the axial fields in MCs present a similar north-south orientation, which changes from cycle to cycle. We discuss the implication of solar cycle variations of MFR axial orientations for space weather forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the effects of varying bulk viscosity coefficients $\zeta(t)=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}H$ on cosmic evolution within the framework of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. We focus on two cases: (i) $\zeta_{1} \neq0$ and (ii) $\zeta_{1} =0$, deriving the Hubble parameter $H$ as a function of redshift $z$ using a linear $f(T)$ model ($f(T) = \alpha T$ where $\alpha \neq 0$). Using the combined $H(z)+Pantheon^{+}+BAO$ dataset, we obtain observational constraints on model parameters. For Case I ($\zeta_1 \neq 0$), best-fit values are $H_0=60.0^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=1.01^{+0.10}_{-0.098}$, $\zeta_0=40.1^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$, and $\zeta_1=0.123^{+0.093}_{-0.088}$, while for Case II ($\zeta_1 = 0$), they are $H_0=67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}$ km/s/Mpc, $\alpha=0.94^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$, and $\zeta_0=34.7^{+2.0}_{-2.0}$. The analysis reveals a transition in the deceleration parameter, indicating a shift from deceleration to acceleration of the universe's expansion, with present-day values of $q_{0} \approx -0.49$ and $q_{0} \approx -0.32$ for the respective cases. The jerk parameter $j(z)$ and effective EoS for the cosmic viscous fluid also support the cosmic acceleration, with trajectories aligning with the quintessence scenario. These findings underscore the potential of our $f(T)$ model dominated by bulk viscous matter in explaining cosmic acceleration.
#### Empirical Modeling of Magnetic Braking in Millisecond Pulsars to Measure the Local Dark Matter Density and Effects of Orbiting Satellite Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method that enables us to estimate the acceleration of individual millisecond pulsars (MSPs) using only their spin period and its time derivative. For our binary MSP sample, we show that one can obtain an empirical calibration of the magnetic braking term that relies only on observed quantities. We find that such a model for magnetic braking is only valid for MSPs with small surface magnetic field strengths ($<3\times10^8$ G) and large characteristic ages ($>$ 5 Gyr). With this method we are able to effectively double the number of pulsars with line-of-sight acceleration measurements, from 28 to 54 sources. This expanded dataset leads to an updated measurement of the total density in the midplane, which we find to be $\rho_0$ = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.001 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$, and an updated measurement of the local dark matter density, which we calculate to be $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ = 0.014 $\pm$ 0.005 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ (0.53 $\pm$ 0.30 GeV/cm$^3$). This updated value for $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ is in good agreement with literature values derived from kinematic estimates. We show that each new acceleration measurement improves the precision of $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ by the same amount as roughly 10$^5$ stars. The pulsar accelerations are very asymmetric above and below the disk; we show that the shape and size of this asymmetry can be largely explained by the north-south asymmetry of disk star counts and the offset in the Milky Way disk and halo centers of mass due to the Large Magellanic Cloud.
#### The Galactic Bulge exploration IV.: RR~Lyrae stars as traces of the Galactic bar -- 3D and 5D analysis, extinction variation

 - **Abstract**
 We created new reddening maps and derived new extinction laws from visual to near-infrared passbands using improved RR~Lyrae period-absolute magnitude-metallicity relations, thus enabling distance estimates for individual bulge RR~Lyrae variables. The extinction law is most uniform in RIK and RJK and the distances to individual RR~Lyrae based on these colors are determined with an accuracy six and four percent, respectively. Using only the near-infrared passbands for distance estimation we inferred the distance to the Galactic center equal to djk = 8.2 +- 0.001(stat) +- 0.53(sys)pc after geometrical correction. We show that variations in the extinction law toward the Galactic bulge can mimic a barred spatial distribution in the bulge RR~Lyrae star population in visual passbands. This arises from a gradient in extinction differences along Galactic longitudes and latitudes, which can create the perception of the Galactic bar, particularly when using visual passband-based distances. A barred angle in the RR~Lyrae spatial distribution disappears when near-infrared passband-based distances are used, as well as when reddening law variations are incorporated in visual passband-based distances. The prominence of the bar, as traced by RR~Lyrae stars, depends on their metallicity, with metal-poor RR~Lyrae stars ([Fe/H]<-1.0dex) showing little to no tilt with respect to the bar. Metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1.0dex) RR~Lyrae stars do show a barred/bulge signature in spatial properties derived using near-infrared distances, with an angle {\iota} = 18 +- 5deg, consistent with previous bar measurements from the literature. The 5D kinematic analysis, primarily based on transverse velocities, indicates a rotational lag in RR~Lyrae stars compared to red clump giants. Despite variations in the extinction law, our kinematic conclusions are robust across different distance estimation methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal holes are thought to be composed of relatively broad columnar structures known as plumes. Here we demonstrate that the plumes (and inter-plumes) in polar coronal holes are composed of fine-scale filamentary structure, with average scales of 2-10$^{\arcsec}$. The fine structure is the off-limb analogue of the previously found 'plumelets' of \cite{Uritsky_2021}. The off-limb observations enable an examination of the fine-structure without the influence of the underlying atmosphere along the line of sight. Hence, we show that the fine-scale structure is present at least until the edge of the field of view of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The fine structure is found to have spatial distribution that follows a $k^{-1}$ power law perpendicular to the inferred magnetic field direction. For a small sample of the fine structure, the cross-sectional profiles are measured as a function of height. In some cases, the measurements indicate that the fine structure expands super-radially, consistent with existing models of polar field expansion and the expansion of the plumes. We discuss the implications of the presence of the fine structure with respect to understanding wave propagation in the coronal holes and their contribution to powering the solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the high-mass binary system V1216 Sco, an eclipsing Algol-type binary hosting a $\beta$ Cephei pulsator, with an orbital period of 3.92 days. This system was analyzed using TESS photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy from SALT HRS to investigate its orbital parameters, stellar properties, and evolutionary history. The TESS light curve, comprising over 12000 data points, revealed five independent pulsation frequencies within the beta Cephei range of 5 to 7 d$^{-1}$. Spectroscopic analysis provided radial velocities and disentangled atmospheric parameters, enabling precise orbital and evolutionary modeling. The system features a primary star of 11.72 M$_{\odot}$ and a secondary of 4.34 M$_{\odot}$. The secondary star has a radius near its Roche lobe, indicating recent or ongoing mass transfer. Evolutionary modeling with MESA-binary suggests that V1216 Sco underwent a case A mass transfer scenario, where mass transfer began while the donor was still on the main sequence. The system's evolutionary models indicate an age of 15 to 30 million years, highlighting the significant impact of binary interactions on stellar evolution. This study underscores the value of combining observational and theoretical approaches to understanding complex systems like V1216 Sco, emphasizing the role of mass transfer in shaping binary star evolution.

 Context. The supernova remnant (SNR) W44 and its surroundings are a prime target for studying the acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Several previous studies established an extended gamma-ray emission that is set apart from the radio shell of W44. This emission is thought to originate from escaped high-energy CRs that interact with a surrounding dense molecular cloud complex. Aims. We present a detailed analysis of Fermi-LAT data with an emphasis on the spatial and spectral properties of W44 and its surroundings. We also report the results of the observations performed with the MAGIC telescopes of the northwestern region of W44. Finally, we present an interpretation model to explain the gamma-ray emission of the SNR and its surroundings. Methods. We first performed a detailed spatial analysis of 12 years of Fermi-LAT data at energies above 1 GeV, in order to exploit the better angular resolution, while we set a threshold of 100MeV for the spectral analysis. We performed a likelihood analysis of 174 hours of MAGIC data above 130 GeV using the spatial information obtained with Fermi-LAT. Results. The combined spectra of Fermi-LAT and MAGIC, extending from 100MeV to several TeV, were used to derive constraints on the escape of CRs. Using a time-dependent model to describe the particle acceleration and escape from the SNR, we show that the maximum energy of the accelerated particles has to be ' 40 GeV. However, our gamma-ray data suggest that a small number of lower-energy particles also needs to escape. We propose a novel model, the broken-shock scenario, to account for this effect and explain the gamma-ray emission.
#### Eruptive YSOs in Cygnus-X: a mid-infrared variability study with NEOWISE and SPICY

 - **Abstract**
 The mass accretion process controls pre-main-sequence evolution, although its intrinsic instability has yet to be fully understood, especially towards the protostellar stage. In this work, we have undertaken a thorough examination of the mid-infrared variability of Spitzer-selected YSOs in the Cygnus-X star-forming region over the last decade, using the NEOWISE time series. This work compares two groups of young stars: embedded Class I objects, and the more evolved flat-spectrum/Class II sources. We report on 48 candidate eruptive variables within these groups, including 14 with characteristics that resemble the photometric behaviour of FUors. We also include an additional 20 YSOs, which are of a less certain categorisation. We find the candidate FUors to be an order of magnitude more common among the younger Class I systems than more evolved objects. A large number of the identified short-duration eruptive YSOs display mid-infrared colour behaviour that is redder-when-brighter, which contrasts with optically bright outbursts seen in YSOs. Finally, we note the unusual long-term rising behaviours of four Class I YSOs, with rise timescales longer than five years, which is far slower than 6-12 month timescale for the majority of optically discovered FUors. Additionally, our broader investigation of MIR variability for embedded class I YSOs shows that there is a higher incidence of high amplitude variability for these stars, than is seen in class II sources. This holds true for all variable class I YSOs, not just the eruptive sources.
