 - **Abstract**
 We present contemporaneous high-angular-resolution millimeter imaging and visible polarimetric imaging of the nearby asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star W Hya to better understand the dynamics and dust formation within a few stellar radii. The star W Hya was observed in two vibrationally excited H2O lines at 268 and 251 GHz with ALMA at a spatial resolution of 16 x 20 mas and at 748 and 820 nm at a resolution of 26 x 27 mas with the VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL. ALMA's high spatial resolution allowed us to image strong emission of the vibrationally excited H2O line at 268 GHz (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 6_5,2 - 7_4,3) over the stellar surface instead of absorption against the continuum, which is expected for thermal excitation. Strong, spotty emission was also detected along and just outside the stellar disk limb at an angular distance of ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii), extending to ~60 mas (~2.9 stellar radii). Another H2O line (v2 = 2, J_K_a,K_c = 9_2,8 - 8_3,5) at 251 GHz with a similar upper-level energy was tentatively identified, which shows absorption over the stellar surface. This suggests that the emission over the surface seen in the 268 GHzH2O line is suprathermal or even maser emission. The estimated gas temperature and H2O density are consistent with the radiatively pumped masers. The 268 GHz H2O line reveals global infall at up to ~15 km/s within 2--3 stellar radii, but outflows at up to ~8 km/s are also present. The polarized intensity maps obtained in the visible reveal clumpy dust clouds forming within ~40 mas (~1.9 stellar radii) with a particularly prominent cloud in the SW quadrant and a weaker cloud in the east. The 268 GHz H2O emission overlaps very well with the visible polarized intensity maps, which suggests that both the nonthermal and likely maser H2O emission and the dust originate from dense, cool pockets in the inhomogeneous atmosphere within ~2--3 stellar radii.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the Gaia Data Release 3 and APOGEE datasets, we investigate the kinematic differences between young stellar objects (YSOs) and their parent clouds in five nearby star-forming regions. Overall, the 1D velocity differences between Class II YSOs and their parent molecular cloud range from [0, 1.4] km/s. In feedback environments dominated by outflows, massive stars, and supernova feedback, the corresponding velocity differences range from [0, 1.4] km/s, [0.1, 0.4] km/s, and [0.1, 1] km/s, respectively. These results indicate that YSO kinematics are not significantly affected by these different types of feedback environment. Additionally, compared to the Class II YSOs, Class III YSOs have slightly larger velocities and dispersions.
#### Modeling the X-ray emission of the Boomerang nebula and implication for its potential ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission

 - **Abstract**
 The Boomerang nebula is a bright radio and X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by an energetic pulsar, PSR~J2229+6114. It is spatially coincident with one of the brightest ultrahigh-energy (UHE, $\ge 100$\,TeV) gamma-ray sources, LHAASO~J2226+6057. While X-ray observations have provided radial profiles for both the intensity and photon index of the nebula, previous theoretical studies have not reached an agreement on their physical interpretation, which also lead to different anticipation of the UHE emission from the nebula. In this work, we model its X-ray emission with a dynamical evolution model of PWN, considering both convective and diffusive transport of electrons. On the premise of fitting the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field within the Boomerang nebula is weak ($\sim 10\mu$G in the core region and diminishing to $1\mu\,G$ at the periphery), which therefore implies a significant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle transport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang nebula via the IC radiation may constitute about $10-50\%$ of the flux of LHAASO~J2226+6057 at 100\,TeV, and up to 30\% at 500\,TeV. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission from the PWN. In our modeling, most of the spindown luminosity of the pulsar may be transformed into thermal particles or relativistic protons.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed X-ray investigation of a region (S1) exhibiting non-thermal X-ray emission within the supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031. Previous analyses modeled this emission with a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index ($\Gamma$) and absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}$). Based on these, S1 was suggested to be the SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or an interaction region between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger dataset favors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the best-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of $\Gamma=1.23\pm0.23$ and $2.24\pm0.16$ below and above a break at $5.57\pm0.52$ keV, respectively. However, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the BPL model, the inferred $N_{\rm H}=(4.08\pm0.72)\times 10^{22}\rm \ cm^{-2}$ towards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical association. The BPL-inferred spectral break $\Delta \Gamma \approx 1$ and hard $\Gamma$ can be naturally explained by a non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) model. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed spectrum, which indicates the presence of sub-relativistic electrons within S1. However, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with unusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out. We discuss these explanations and their implications for gamma-ray emission from CTB 37B, and describe future observations that could settle the origin of S1.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the observations of a quiescent filament eruption and its deflection from the radial direction. The event occurred in the southern solar hemisphere on 2021 May 9 and was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), by the STEREO A Observatory and GONG. Part of the filament erupted in the west direction, while major part of the filament deviated towards east direction. LASCO observed a very weak CME towards the west direction where it faded quickly. Moreover, the eruption was associated with CME observed by STEREO A COR1 and COR2. Our observations provide the evidence that the filament eruption was highly non-radial in nature.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of magnetic fields within molecular clouds is fundamental to understanding star formation processes. Accurately gauging the three-dimensional structure of these fields presents a challenge, as observational techniques such as dust polarization and the Zeeman effect each provide only partial information on the orientation and line-of-sight strength, respectively. By analyzing a suite of AREPO simulations, this paper investigates how observables can relate to underlying physical properties to derive a more comprehensive picture of the magnetic field's inclination angle and strength, specifically in regions where both dust polarization and Zeeman data are available. To demonstrate the method, we produce synthetic observations of the polarization angle dispersion and line-of-sight Alfvén Mach Number and explore the behavior of the inclination angle, $\gamma$, and strength of the magnetic field in regions where both Zeeman and dust polarization data are available. We find that dust polarization data can be used to determine the inclination angle if the cloud is known to be trans-Alfvénic or sub-Alfvénic. The strength of the magnetic field relative to turbulence can be estimated by comparing polarization observations to Zeeman observations. Comparing the dispersion of the polarization angle to the estimated line-of-sight Alfvén Mach Number provides clues about the strength of the magnetic field and, consequently, the orientation of the magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in sub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance of new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with large-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to fully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the atmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability characteristics. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk microphysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres. We derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and develop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include homogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes that evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our new 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl clouds in a Tint = 400 K, log g = 4.25 Y-dwarf atmosphere and examine the effect of cloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics. Our results show a generally homogeneous global KCl cloud, with only slight variations occurring in the equatorial regions. The atmosphere is generally sluggish and stagnant, with near-zero vertical velocities throughout most of the atmosphere. Only very small grains ~0.01 um remain lofted in the atmosphere. Our results conform with dynamical theories for this parameter regime, with our model showing minimal (~0.2%) spectral variability at mid-infrared wavelengths. Our study demonstrates that the 2-moment bulk cloud microphysical scheme is a highly suitable method for investigating cloud characteristics and feedback in GCMs and other large scale simulations of sub-stellar atmospheres. Split moment schemes and mixed material grains will be explored in a follow up study.
#### A Survey of Cassini Images of Spokes in Saturn's Rings: Unusual Spoke Types and Seasonal Trends

 - **Abstract**
 Spokes are localized clouds of fine particles that appear over the outer part of Saturn's B ring. Over the course of the Cassini Mission, the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) obtained over 20,000 images of the outer B ring, providing the most comprehensive data set for quantifying spoke properties currently available. Consistent with prior work, we find that spokes typically appear as dark features when the lit side of the rings are viewed at low phase angles, and as bright features when the rings are viewed at high phase angles or the dark side of the rings are observed. However, we also find examples of spokes on the dark side of the rings that transition between being brighter and darker than the background ring as they move around the planet. Most interestingly, we also identify spokes that appear to be darker than the background ring near their center and brighter than the background ring near their edges. These "mixed spokes" indicate that the particle size distribution can vary spatially within a spoke. In addition, we document seasonal variations in the overall spoke activity over the course of the Cassini mission using statistics derived from lit-side imaging sequences. These statistics demonstrate that while spokes can be detected over a wide range of solar elevation angles, spoke activity increases dramatically when the Sun is within 10 degrees of the ring plane.
#### Self-Excited Pulsations and the Instability Strip of Long-Period Variables: the Transition from Small-Amplitude Red Giants to Semi-Regular Variables

 - **Abstract**
 We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic stellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of self-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with OGLE observations in the period-luminosity diagram we are able to link the transition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a shift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent with previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss rate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The luminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to depend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length parameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the pulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical pulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear evidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and physical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the predictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the temperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is critical for model-based studies of the period-luminosity relations of evolved stars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in particular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope composition. The grid of models is made publicly available with a companion interpolation routine.
