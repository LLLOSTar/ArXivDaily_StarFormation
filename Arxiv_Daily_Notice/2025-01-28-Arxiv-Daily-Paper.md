 - **Abstract**
 Highly-irradiated gas giant exoplanets are predicted to show circulation patterns dominated by day-to-night heat transport and a spatial distribution of clouds that is driven by advection and local heating. Hot-Jupiters have been extensively studied from broadband phase-curve observations at infrared and optical wavelengths, but spectroscopic observations in the reflected light are rare and the regime of smaller and higher-metallicity ultra-hot planets, such as hot-Neptunes, remains largely unexplored to date. Here we present the phase-resolved reflected-light and thermal-emission spectroscopy of the ultra-hot Neptune LTT 9779b, obtained through observing its full phase-curve from 0.6 to 2.8 $\mu$m with JWST NIRISS/SOSS. We detect an asymmetric dayside in reflected light (3.1$\sigma$ significance) with highly-reflective white clouds on the western dayside (A = 0.79$\pm$0.15) and a much lower-albedo eastern dayside (A = 0.41$\pm$0.10), resulting in an overall dayside albedo of A = 0.50$\pm$0.07. The thermal phase curve is symmetric about the substellar point, with a dayside effective temperature of T$_\mathrm{eff,day}$ = 2,260$^{+40}_{-50}$ K and a cold nightside (T$_\mathrm{eff,night}$ <1,330 K at 3-$\sigma$ confidence), indicative of short radiative timescales. We propose an atmospheric circulation and cloud distribution regime in which heat is transported eastward from the dayside towards the cold nightside by an equatorial jet, leading to a colder western dayside where temperatures are sufficiently low for the condensation of silicate clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a product of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white dwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance of triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV catalogs, we construct a sample of $\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within 1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at separations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide tertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples using detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that 20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and donor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after the formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer birth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do undergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the tertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially wide inner orbits ($\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary separations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the observed Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide binaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of triples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact binaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study the circumstellar material (CSM) around massive stars, and the mass-loss rates depositing this CSM, using a large sample of radio observations of 325 core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; only $\sim 22 \%$ of them being detected). This sample comprises both archival data and our new observations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic approach devised to constrain the mass-loss at different stages of stellar evolution. In the SN-CSM interaction model, observing the peak of the radio emission of a SN provides the CSM density at a given radius (and therefore mass-loss rate that deposited this CSM). On the other hand, limits on the radio emission, and/or on the peak of the radio emission provide a region in the CSM phase space that can be ruled out. Our analysis shows discrepancy between the values of mass-loss rates derived from radio-detected and radio-non-detected SNe. Furthermore, we rule out mass-loss rates in the range of $2 \times 10^{-6} - 10^{-4} \, \rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ for different epochs during the last 1000 years before the explosion (assuming wind velocity of $10 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$) for the progenitors of $\sim 80\%$ of the type II SNe in our sample. In addition, we rule out the ranges of mass-loss rates suggested for red supergiants for $\sim 50 \%$ of the progenitors of type II SNe in our sample. We emphasize here that these results take a step forward in constraining mass-loss in winds from a statistical point of view.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A$^*$). Scattering in the turbulent plasma of the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of Sgr A$^*$ on scales only marginally smaller than the fiducial resolution of EHT. Therefore, this process both diffractive blurs and adds stochastic refractive substructures that limits the practical angular resolution of EHT images of Sgr A$^*$. We utilized a novel recurrent neural network machine learning framework to demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate interstellar scattering at wavelengths of $1.3\,{\rm mm}$ near the galactic center up to structures at the scale of $5\mu{as}$ well below the nominal instrumental resolution of EHT, $24\,\mu{\rm as}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs lack nuclear fusion and cool with time; the coldest known have an effective temperature below 500 K, and are known as Y dwarfs. We present a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometric dataset of Y dwarfs: twenty-three were imaged in wide-field mode, 20 using NIRCam with the F150W and F480M filters, and 3 using NIRISS with the F480M filter. We present an F480M vs. F150W $-$ F480M color-magnitude diagram for our sample, and other brown dwarfs with F150W and F480M colors synthesized from JWST spectra by Beiler et al. (2024). For one target, WISEA J083011.95$+$283716.0, its detection in the near-infrared confirms it as one of the reddest Y dwarfs known, with F150W $-$ F480M $= 9.62$ mag. We provide its updated parallax and proper motion. One of the Beiler et al. Y dwarfs, CWISEP J104756.81+545741.6, is unusually blue, consistent with strong CO absorption seen in its spectrum which the F480M filter is particularly sensitive to. The strong CO and the kinematics of the object suggest it may be very low-mass and young. We update the resolved photometry for the close binary system WISE J033605.05$-$014350.4 AB, and find that the secondary is almost as cold as WISE 085510.83$-$071442.5, with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 300$ K, however the F150W $-$ F480M color is significantly bluer, possibly suggesting the presence of water clouds. Astrometry is measured at the JWST epoch for the sample which is consistent with parallax and proper motion values reported by Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) and Marocco et al. (in prep).

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino quantum kinetics is a rapidly evolving field in computational astrophysics, with a primary focus on collective neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and post-merger phases of binary neutron star mergers. In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning resolution dependence in numerical simulations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive resolution study in both angular- and spatial directions by using two independent schemes of quantum kinetic neutrino transport: finite volume and pseudospectral methods. We complement our discussion by linear stability analysis including inhomogeneous modes. Our result suggests that decreasing spatial resolutions underestimates the growth of flavor instability, and then leads to wrong asymptotic states of flavor conversions, which potentially has a critical impact on astrophysical consequences. We further delve into numerical results of low resolution simulations, that reveals the underlying mechanism responsible for numerical artifacts caused by insufficient resolutions. This study settles the debate on requirements of resolutions and serves as a guideline for numerical modeling of quantum kinetic neutrino transport.

 - **Abstract**
 We present data processing and verification of the Southern Twenty-centimetre All-sky Polarization Survey (STAPS) conducted with Murriyang, the Parkes 64-m telescope. The survey covers the sky area of -89<Dec<0 and the frequency range of 1.3-1.8 GHz split into 1-MHz channels. STAPS was observed commensally with the S-band Polarization All-Sky Survey (S-PASS). The survey is composed of long azimuth scans, which allows us to absolutely calibrate Stokes Q and U with the data processing procedure developed for S-PASS. We obtain I, Q, and U maps in both flux density scale (Jy/beam) and main beam brightness temperature scale (K), for the 301 frequency channels with sufficiently good data. The temperature scale is tied to the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) high-band north sky survey conducted with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory 26-m telescope. All the STAPS maps are smoothed to a common resolution of 20 arcmin. The rms noise per channel ranges from about 16 mK to 8 mK for I, and from about 8 mK to 5 mK for Q and U at frequencies from 1.3 to 1.8 GHz. The rms noise in Q and U varies with declination and reaches minimum at declination of -89 degree. We also run rotation measure (RM) synthesis and RM clean to obtain peak polarized intensity and Faraday depth maps. The whole STAPS data processing is validated by comparing flux densities of compact sources, pixel flux density versus pixel flux density for Cen A, pixel temperature versus pixel temperature for the entire survey area, and RMs of extragalactic sources between STAPS and other measurements. The uncertainty of the flux density scale is less than 10%. STAPS delivers an L-band (20 cm) multi-frequency polarization view of the Galaxy, and will help advance our understanding of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetized interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed spectral bump in cosmic-ray (CR) proton and helium spectra, along with the phase and amplitude evolution of CR dipole anisotropy, provide plausible yet indirect evidence for the presence of a nearby CR source. This study investigates the potential of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) located near the solar system to act as natural probes of CRs from the nearby source, with their gamma-ray emissions serving as indicators of spatial variations in CR flux within the solar neighborhood resulting from this source. We show that a nearby source, accounting for the CR data, could imprint distinct features on the $\gamma$-ray spectra of different GMCs. We expect that these features are detectable by LHAASO and upcoming high-energy $\gamma$-ray observatories, providing a powerful test for the hypothesized nearby source. Notably, we find that determining the energy dependence of the $\gamma$-ray spectral index offers a promising approach to investigate the nearby source and constrain its distance. Conversely, if the spectral bump is a widespread Galactic phenomenon, the energy dependence would exhibit uniformity across all GMCs, distinguishing the underlying mechanism accounting for the spectral bump from the scenario involving a nearby source.

 - **Abstract**
 NCORES was a large observing program on the ESO HARPS spectrograph, dedicated to measuring the masses of Neptune-like and smaller transiting planets discovered by the TESS satellite using the radial velocity technique. This paper presents an overview of the programme, its scientific goals and published results, covering 35 planets in 18 planetary systems. We present spectrally derived stellar characterisation and mass constraints for five additional TOIs where radial velocity observations found only marginally significant signals (TOI-510.01, $M_p=1.08^{+0.58}_{-0.55}M_\oplus$), or found no signal (TOIs 271.01, 641.01, 697.01 and 745.01). A newly detected non-transiting radial velocity candidate is presented orbiting TOI-510 on a 10.0d orbit, with a minimum mass of $4.82^{+1.29}_{-1.26}M_\oplus$, although uncertainties on the system architecture and true orbital period remain. Combining the NCORES sample with archival known planets we investigate the distribution of planet masses and compositions around and below the radius gap, finding that the population of planets below the gap is consistent with a rocky composition and ranges up to a sharp cut-off at $10M_\oplus$. We compare the observed distribution to models of pebble- and planetesimal-driven formation and evolution, finding good broad agreement with both models while highlighting interesting areas of potential discrepancy. Increased numbers of precisely measured planet masses in this parameter space are required to distinguish between pebble and planetesimal accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 This study is aimed at identifying possible low-mass and sub-stellar companions to stars with well-determined metallicities. We investigate the multiplicity of metal-poor stars along with its impact on formation processes in the conditions of the early universe. Our goal is to look for wide common proper motion companions to metal-poor stars and study the binarity frequency at low metallicity with astrometry from large-scale catalogues (Gaia, VHS, and WISE). We used the stellar parameter determination from the latest release of Gaia to identify metal-poor stars over the entire sky. We combined the Gaia sample with other public catalogues and spectroscopic determinations for a given subsample to refine the stellar metallicities. We also considered other public catalogues of metal-poor stars to look for co-moving companions. We obtained our own high-resolution images of a subsample with the lucky imaging technique. We found a few bona fide co-moving systems among a sample of 610 metal-poor stars with metallicities below -1.5 dex in the full sky. We inferred a multiplicity rate below 3%, with 3sigma completeness for projected separations larger than 8 au, after taking into account incompleteness and any other limiting factors of our search. At closer separations, we found a minimum binary fraction of 20% that appears to be relatively independent of metallicity. We conclude that the multiplicity fraction of solar-type stars is relatively independent of metallicity for close-in companions with projected separations below ~8 au. Between 8 and 10000 au, the binary fraction of metal-poor stars drops significantly to a few percent and is significantly lower than the multiplicity derived for the solar-metallicity case. We interpret these similarities and differences as being due to the chemistry at work in molecular clouds as well as disruption effects attributed to the old age of subdwarfs.
#### Giant Molecular Clouds in RCW 106 (G333): Galactic Mini-starbursts and Massive Star Formation Induced by Supersonic Cloud-Cloud Collisions

 - **Abstract**
 To reveal the origin of the mini-starbursts in the Milky Way, we carried out large-scale CO observations toward the RCW 106 giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex using the NANTEN2 4-m radio telescope operated by Nagoya University. We also analyzed the Mopra Southern Galactic plane CO survey and Herschel infrared continuum archival data. The RCW 106 GMC complex contains the radial velocity components of $-68$ km s$^{-1}$ and $-50$ km s$^{-1}$ reported by Nguyen et al. (2015). Focusing on the RCW 106 East and West region with the massive star formation having the bright infrared dust emission, we found that these regions have three different velocity components with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences. The two out of three velocity components show morphological correspondence with the infrared cold dust emission and connect with the bridge feature on a position-velocity diagram. Therefore, two molecular clouds (MCs) with $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ differences are likely to be physically associated with massive star-forming regions in the GMC complex. Based on these observational results, we argue that mini-starbursts and massive star/cluster formation in the RCW 106 GMC complex are induced by supersonic cloud-cloud collisions in an agglomerate of molecular gas on the Scutum-Centurus arm.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of upcoming large-scale surveys like Euclid, the necessity for the automation of strong lens detection is essential. While existing machine learning pipelines heavily rely on the classification probability (P), this study intends to address the importance of integrating additional metrics, such as Information Content (IC) and the number of pixels above the segmentation threshold, to alleviate the false positive rate in unbalanced data-sets. In this work, we introduce a segmentation algorithm (U-Net) as a supplementary step in the established strong gravitational lens identification pipeline (Denselens), which primarily utilizes P$_{\rm mean}$ and IC$_{\rm mean}$ parameters for the detection and ranking. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of segmentation enables significant reduction of false positives by approximately 25 per cent in the final sample extracted from DenseLens, without compromising the identification of strong lenses. The main objective of this study is to automate the strong lens detection process by integrating these three metrics. To achieve this, a decision tree-based selection process is introduced, applied to the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) data. This process involves rank-ordering based on classification scores, filtering based on Information Content, and segmentation score. Additionally, the study presents 14 newly discovered strong lensing candidates identified by the U-Denselens network using the KiDS DR4 data.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star formation involves significant ionization in the innermost regions near the central object, such as gravitationally trapped H II regions, jets, ionized disks, or winds. Resolved observations of the associated continuum and recombination line emission are crucial for guiding theory. The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will enable unprecedented observations of thermal emission with 1 mas resolution, providing a new perspective on massive star formation at scales down to a few astronomical units at kiloparsec distances. This work presents synthetic interferometric ngVLA observations of the free-free continuum (93-GHz band), $\mathrm{H41\alpha}$, and $\mathrm{H38\alpha}$ recombination lines from ionized jets and disks around massive protostars. Using the sf3dmodels Python package, we generate gas distributions based on analytical models, which are then processed through the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. Our results indicate that the ngVLA can easily resolve, both spatially and spectrally, the ionized jet from a 15 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ protostar at 700 pc, distinguishing between collimated jets and wide-angle winds, and resolving their launching radii, widths, and any substructure down to a few astronomical units. Detailed studies of radio jets launched by massive protostars will be feasible up to distances of $\sim 2$ kpc. Furthermore, ngVLA will be able to study in detail the ionized disks around massive ($> 10~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) protostars up to distances from 4 to 12 kpc, resolving their kinematics and enabling the measurement of their central masses across the Galaxy. These observations can be conducted with on-source integrations of only a few hours.
