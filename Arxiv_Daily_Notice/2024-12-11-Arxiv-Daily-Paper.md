 - **Abstract**
 We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from a ~5 Mpc-long (comoving) portion of the cosmic web hosting an overdensity ($\delta \approx 25$) of 19 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z\approx 4$ within the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF), reaching an average surface brightness (SB) of $5\times 10^{-20}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}~ cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$. This large-scale structure has an average SB similar to the filament across the two MUDF quasars at $z\approx 3.22$. However, deep multiwavelength data do not show a clear presence of active galactic nuclei, suggesting that the emission is mainly regulated by the underlying gas density. We find $\approx 0.2$ dex higher star formation compared to control samples and a remarkable predominance (5/7) of blue-peaked emission lines in the spectra of the embedded LAEs, indicative of favorable conditions for gas accretion. Lastly, we quantify the contribution of intragalactic gas to the Ly$\alpha$ SB profile at large distances from LAEs. By studying samples of filaments detected in emission within diverse environments, we are finally gaining new insight into the physics of gas accretion within the cosmic web.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is a satellite orbiting the Milky Way that has experienced multiple stripping events due to tidal interactions with our Galaxy. Its accretion history has led to a distinct stellar overdensity, which is the remnant of the core of the progenitor. We present a complete chemical analysis of 111 giant stars in the core of Sgr dSph to investigate the chemical evolution and enrichment history of this satellite. Employing the metallicity-sensitive Ca H&K photometry from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, we selected stars spanning a wide metallicity range and obtained high-resolution spectra with the ESO FLAMES/GIRAFFE multi-object spectrograph. For the stellar sample covering $-2.13 < \rm{[Fe/H] < -0.35}$, we derived abundances for up to 14 chemical elements with average uncertainties of $\sim 0.09$ dex and a set of stellar ages which allowed us to build an age-metallicity relation (AMR) for the entire sample. With the most comprehensive set of chemical species measured for the core of Sgr, we studied several [X/Fe] ratios. Most trends align closely with Galactic chemical trends, but notable differences emerge in the heavy $n$-capture elements, which offer independent insights into the star formation history of a stellar population. The deficiency in the $\alpha$-elements with respect the Milky Way suggests a slower, less efficient early star formation history, similar to other massive satellites. $S$-process element patterns indicate significant enrichment from AGB stars over time. The AMR and chemical ratios point to an extended star formation history, with a rapid early phase in the first Gyr, followed by declining activity and later star-forming episodes. These findings are consistent with Sgr hosting multiple stellar populations, from young ($\sim 4$ Gyr) to old, metal-poor stars ($\sim 10$ Gyr)

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the interaction between a shock-driven hot wind and a cold multi-cloud layer, for conditions commonly found in interstellar and circumgalactic gas. We present a method for identifying distinct clouds using a Friends-of-Friends algorithm. This approach unveils novel detailed information about individual clouds and their collective behaviour. By tracing the evolution of individual clouds, our method provides comprehensive descriptions of cloud morphology, including measures of the elongation and fractal dimension. Combining the kinematics and morphology of clouds, we refine previous models for drag and entrainment processes. Our by-cloud analysis allows to discern the dominant entrainment processes at different times. We find that after the initial shock passage, momentum transfer due to condensation becomes increasingly important, compared to ram pressure, which dominates at early times. We also find that internal motions within clouds act as an effective dynamic pressure that exceeds the thermal pressure by an order of magnitude. Our analysis shows how the highly efficient cooling of the warm mixed gas at temperatures $\sim 10^{5}$ K is effectively balanced by the kinetic energy injected by the hot wind into the warm and cold phases via shocks and shear motions. Compression-driven condensation and turbulence dissipation maintain a multi-phase outflow and can help explain the presence of dense gas in galaxy-scale winds. Finally, we show that applying our Friends-of-Friends analysis to $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$-emitting gas and correcting for beam size and telescope sensitivity can explain two populations of $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$ clouds within the Milky-Way nuclear wind as structures pertaining to the same outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 The B2 star $\epsilon$ CMa, at parallax distance $d = 124\pm2$~pc, dominates the H I photoionization of the local interstellar cloud (LIC). At its closer parallax distance compared to previous estimates, $\epsilon$ CMa has a 0.9 mag fainter absolute magnitude $M_V =-3.97\pm0.04$. We combine measurements of distance with the integrated flux $f = (41.5\pm3.3) \times 10^{-6}~{\rm erg~cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and angular diameter $\theta_d = 0.80\pm0.05$~mas to produce a consistent set of stellar parameters: radius $R = 10.7\pm0.7~R_{\odot}$, mass $M = 13.1\pm2.3~M_{\odot}$, gravity $\log g = 3.50\pm0.05$, effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} \approx 21,000$~K, and luminosity $L \approx 20,000~L_{\odot}$. These parameters place Epsilon CMa outside the $\beta$ Cephei instability strip, consistent with its observed lack of pulsations. The observed EUV spectrum yields a hydrogen photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm HI} \approx 10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$ (at Earth). The total flux decrement factor at the Lyman limit ($\Delta_{\rm LL} = 5000\pm500$) is a combination of attenuation in the stellar atmosphere ($\Delta_{\rm star} = 110\pm10$) and interstellar medium ($\Delta_{\rm ISM} = 45\pm5$) with optical depth $\tau_{\rm LL} = 3.8\pm0.1$. After correcting for interstellar HI column density $N_{\rm HI} = (6\pm1)\times10^{17}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, we find a stellar LyC photon flux $\Phi_{\rm LyC} \approx 3000~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ and ionizing luminosity $Q_{\rm LyC} = 10^{45.7\pm0.3}$ photons s$^{-1}$. The photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm H} \approx$ (1-2)$\times 10^{-14}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ at the cloud surface produces an ionization fraction (30-40\%) for total hydrogen density $n_{\rm H} = 0.2$ cm$^{-3}$. With its $27.3\pm0.4$ km/s heliocentric radial velocity and small proper motion, $\epsilon$ CMa passed within $9.3\pm0.5$ pc of the Sun 4.4 Myr ago, with a 180 times higher photoionization rate.

 - **Abstract**
 WD\,0141--675 was reported as the first astrometrically detected white dwarf planet host candidate as part of the third data release from \textit{Gaia}, just to be later retracted via a news item on the \textit{Gaia} web site$^1$. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical ESPRESSO spectroscopy of \obj. A radial velocity analysis of the \Ion{Ca}~K absorption line reveals a tentative periodic signal of $15.6\pm0.9$\,d. Phase-folding the ESPRESSO spectroscopy on this signal exhibits weak variability in the morphology of \Ion{Ca}~K close to the core of the line. A violet-to-red ratio analysis of the Ca~K line shows a periodic signal of $16.1\pm0.9$\,d. The periods from both methods agree, within their uncertainties, with half the period of the astrometric planet candidate, however, both measurements are of low statistical significance. Nonetheless, our results imply possible solutions to the mass function within the planetary regime. And when combined with existing infrared photometry, which rules out a brown dwarf companion, yield a lower limit on the orbital inclination of $\sim7^\circ$. Our study demonstrates that ESPRESSO observations are well capable of detecting short-period (days to weeks) giant planets orbiting white dwarfs.
#### Impact of the shape of the prestellar density fluctuations on the core mass function

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that departure from sphericity in the geometry of primordial dark matter halos modifies their mass function. The ellipsoidal collapse model yields a better agreement with simulations of hierarchical clustering than the original, spherical model. In the present paper, we examine the same issue in the context of star formation by studying the impact of non-sphericity of density perturbations in a gravoturbulent medium on the prestellar core mass function (CMF). An important question, notably, is to find out how ellipsoidal, instead of spherical, initial density fluctuations modify both the high-mass and low-mass tails of the CMF. Our study shows that triaxial density fluctuations indeed depart from a purely spherical form but the deformation (prolateness and ellipticity) remains modest, suggesting that the usual hypothesis of spherical collapse in existing theories of the IMF is reasonable. We find that, as in the cosmological case, the departure from sphericity increases the collapse barrier, stabilizing the prestellar cores. The striking difference between the stellar case and the cosmological one for the ellipsoidal collapse model is that, although in both cases the less dense structures are the most deformed, they correspond to small scales, thus low mass halos in cosmology but to large scales, thus large mass cores in star formation. As a result, the high mass range of the CMF is the most affected by the ellipsoidal collapse, resulting in a slightly less steep slope than the one predicted with the spherical hypothesis and a peak slightly shifted toward lower masses.

 - **Abstract**
 Using nearly 230,000 red clump stars selected from LAMOST and Gaia, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the stellar age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) for various disk populations, within 5.0 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$ $\leq$ 3.0 kpc. The AVRs of the whole RC sample stars are accurately described as $\sigma_{v}$ = $\sigma_{v,0}$ ($\tau$ + 0.1)$^{\beta_{v}}$, with $\beta_{R}$, $\beta_{\phi}$ and $\beta_{Z}$ displaying a global exponential decreasing trend with $R$, which may point to the difference in spatial distributions of various disk heating mechanisms. The measurements of $\beta$ $-$ $R$ for various disks suggest that the thin disk exhibits a radial dependence, with a global exponential decreasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$, while $\beta_{\phi}$ remains a nearly constant value (around 0.20$\sim$0.25) within 8.5 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 11.5 kpc. The thick disk displays a global increasing trend in $\beta_{R}$ $-$ $R$, $\beta_{\phi}$ $-$ $R$ and $\beta_{Z}$ $-$ $R$. These results indicate that the thin disk stars are likely heated by long-term heating from GMCs and spiral arms, while thick disk stars are likely heated by some violent heating process from merger and accretion, and/or formed by the inside-out and upside-down star formation scenarios, and/or born in the chaotic mergers of gas-rich systems and/or turbulent ISM. Our results also suggest that the disk perturbation by a recent minor merger from Sagittarius may have occurred within 3.0 Gyr.

 - **Abstract**
 While the environment around Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) has long been believed to be close to homogeneous, the latest analysis of Chandra data has identified a substantial deceleration of the forward shock which poses a major challenges to this picture. arXiv:2310.14841 showed that the existence of dense molecular cloud (MC) surrounding a rarefied wind-like circumstellar matter (CSM) can explain this observational finding in term of the shock-expansion dynamics, supporting the so-called single-degenerate scenario for the progenitor system. We here extend this work to study the non-thermal emission processes and investigate whether such an environment is consistent with the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. While the simulated broadband spectrum based on the wind-MC environment is largely consistent with observations, we find that such an environment predicts a harder gamma-ray spectrum than observed due to the relatively low CSM density in the cavity interior of the MC. This difference can be at least partially attributed to the present one-dimensional setup of the model which does not account for the clumpy and multi-dimensional structure of the CSM. Our model provides predictions for the long-term evolution of the broadband spectrum which can be used to further probe Tycho's surrounding environment in the future, a key to resolving the long-standing issue of type Ia supernova progenitor channels.
#### Early Solar System Turbulence Constrained by High Oxidation States of the Oldest Non-Carbonaceous Planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 Early Solar System (SS) planetesimals constitute the parent bodies of most meteorites investigated today. Nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies of bulk meteorites have revealed a dichotomy between non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) groups. Planetesimals sampling NC and CC isotopic signatures are conventionally thought to originate from the "dry" inner disk, and volatile-rich outer disk, respectively, with their segregation enforced by a pressure bump close to the water-ice sublimation line, possibly tied to Jupiter's formation. This framework is challenged by emerging evidence that the oldest NC planetesimals (i.e., the iron meteorites parent bodies; IMPBs) were characterized by far higher oxidation states than previously imagined, suggesting abundant ($\gtrsim$ few wt.%) liquid water in their interiors prior to core differentiation. In this paper, we employ a model for a degassing icy planetesimal (heated by $^{26}$Al decay) to map the conditions for liquid water production therein. Our work culminates in threshold characteristic sizes for pebbles composing the said planetesimal, under which water-ice melting occurs. Adopting a model for a disk evolving under both turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic disk winds, and assuming pebble growth is fragmentation-limited, we self-consistently translate the threshold pebble size to lower limits on early SS turbulence. We find that if NC IMPBs were "wet," their constituent pebbles must have been smaller than a few centimeters, corresponding to typical values of the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha_{\nu}$ turbulence parameter in excess of $10^{-3}$. These findings argue against a quiescent SS disk (for <10 AU), are concordant with astronomical constraints on protoplanetary disk turbulence, and suggest pebble accretion played a secondary role in building our rocky planets.
#### Determining stellar properties of massive stars in NGC346 in the SMC with a Bayesian statistic technique

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 346 is a young cluster with numerous hot OB stars. It is part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and has an average metallicity that is one-seventh of the Milky Way's. A detailed study of its stellar content provides a unique opportunity to understand the stellar and wind properties of massive stars in low-metallicity environments, and enables us to improve our understanding of star formation and stellar evolution. The fundamental stellar parameters defining a star's spectral appearance are its effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Unfortunately, these parameters cannot be obtained independently from only H and He spectral features as they are partially degenerate. With this work we aim to overcome this degeneracy by applying a newly developed Bayesian statistic technique that can fit these three parameters simultaneously. Multi-epoch optical spectra are used in combination with a Bayesian statistic technique to fit stellar properties based on a publicly available grid of synthetic spectra of stellar atmospheres. The use of all of the multi-epoch observations simultaneously allows the identification of binaries. The stellar parameters for 34 OB stars within the core of NGC 346 are derived and presented here. By the use of both $\mathrm{He}\textsc{i}$ and $\mathrm{He}\textsc{ii}$ lines, the partial degeneracy between the stellar parameters of effective surface temperature, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity is overcome. A lower limit to the binary fraction of the sample of stars is found to be at least 46%. Based on comparisons with analysis conducted on an overlapping sample of stars within NGC 346, the Bayesian statistic technique approach is shown to be a viable method to measure stellar parameters for hot massive stars in low-metallicity environments even when only low-resolution spectra are available.}

 - **Abstract**
 SHAPE (Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth) is an experiment onboard the Chandrayaan-3 Mission, designed to study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the habitable planet Earth in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (1.0 - 1.7 $\mu$m). The spectro-polarimeter is the only scientific payload (experimental in nature) on the Propulsion Module (PM) of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The instrument is a compact and lightweight spectro-polarimeter with an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF) at its core. The AOTF operates in the frequency range of 80 MHz to 135 MHz with a power of 0.5 - 2.0 Watts. The two output beams (e-beam and o-beam) from the AOTF are focused onto two InGaAs detectors (pixelated, 1D linear array) with the help of focusing optics. The primary (aperture) optics, with a diameter of $\sim$2 mm, collects the NIR light for input to the AOTF, defining the field of view (FOV) of 2.6$^\circ$. The payload has a mass of 4.8 kg and operates at a power of 25 Watts. This manuscript highlights some of the ground-based results, including the post-launch initial performance of the payload while orbiting around the Moon to observe Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Volume density is a key physical quantity controlling the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation, but it cannot be accessed directly by observations of molecular clouds. We aim at estimating the volume density distribution in nearby molecular clouds, to measure the relation between column and volume densities and to determine their roles as predictors of star formation. We develop an inverse modelling method to estimate the volume density distributions of molecular clouds. We apply this method to 24 nearby molecular clouds for which column densities have been derived using Herschel observations and for which star formation efficiencies (SFE) have been derived using observations with the Spitzer space telescope. We then compare the relationships of several column- and volume-density based descriptors of dense gas with the SFE of the clouds. We derive volume density distributions for 24 nearby molecular clouds, which represents the most complete sample of such distributions to date. The relationship between column densities and peak volume densities in these clouds is a piece-wise power-law relation that changes its slope at a column density of $5-10\times 10^{22}$ H$_2$cm$^{-2}$. We interpret this as a signature of hierarchical fragmentation in the dense ISM. We find that the volume-density based dense gas fraction is the best predictor of star formation in the clouds, and in particular, it is as anticipated a better predictor than the column-density based dense gas fraction. We also derive a volume density threshold density for star formation of $2\times 10^4$ H$_2$cm$^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We analyse multi-colour photometric and spectroscopic observations of a Young Stellar Object Gaia20bdk. Aims. We aim to investigate the exact nature of the eruptive phenomenon that the star has been experiencing since 2018. Methods. We use public-domain archival photometry to characterise the quiescent phase in order to establish major physical parameters of the progenitor. Then, we use our and public-domain optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy to study the outburst. Results. Gaia20bdk is a member of the Sharpless 2-301 star-forming region, at a distance of 3.3 kpc. The progenitor is a rather massive 2.7 solar mass, G7-type Class I young star having an effective temperature of 5300 K and bolometric luminosity of 11 solar luminosities. The optical and infrared photometric and spectroscopic data obtained during the outburst show a variety of signatures commonly found in classical FUors. Our disc modelling results in a bolometric luminosity of 100-200 solar luminosities and mass accretion rate of 1-2e-5 solar masses per year, also confirming the object's FUor classification. Further monitoring is necessary to track the light changes, accretion rate and spectral variations, as well as to understood the mechanisms behind the disc flickering.
