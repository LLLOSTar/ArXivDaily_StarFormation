#### Calibrating chemical mixing induced by internal gravity waves based on hydrodynamical simulations; The chemical evolution of OB-type stars

 - **Abstract**
 Internal gravity waves (IGWs) have been shown to contribute to the transport of chemical elements in stars with a convective core and radiative envelope. Recent 2D hydrodynamical simulations of convection in intermediate-mass stars have provided estimates of the chemical mixing efficiency of such waves. The chemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing is described by a constant A times the squared wave velocity. The value of A, however, remains unconstrained by such simulations. This work aims at investigating what values A can take in order to reproduce the observed nitrogen surface abundances of the most nitrogen-enriched massive stars. Furthermore, we discuss the prevalence of IGW mixing compared to rotational mixing. We provide an implementation of these mixing profiles predicted from hydrodynamical simulations in the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We compute evolution tracks for stars between 3 and 30Msun with this new implementation for IGW mixing and study the evolution for the surface abundances of isotopes involved in the CNO cycle, particularly the N14 isotope. We show that this 1D framework predicting the chemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing yields consistent morphologies of the mixing profile in comparison with hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the value of A must increase with mass in order to reproduce the most nitrogen-enriched stars. Assuming these calibrated values for A, mixing by IGWs is a potential mechanism to reproduce well-mixed stars without needing rapid rotation. We have provided observational limits on the efficiency of IGW mixing for future theoretical studies. Future asteroseismic modelling efforts taking IGW mixing into account will be able to place additional constraints on the convective core mass, as our models predict that the convective core should be significantly more massive if IGW mixing is indeed efficient.
#### Inferring the density and membership of stellar streams with flexible models: The GD-1 stream in Gaia Data Release 3

 - **Abstract**
 As bound stellar systems orbit within a galaxy, stars may be tidally stripped to form streams of stars that nearly follow the orbit of their progenitor system. Stellar streams provide one of the most promising avenues for constraining the global mass distribution of the Milky Way and the nature of dark matter (DM). The stream stars' kinematic "track" enables inferring large-scale properties of the DM distribution, while density variations and anomalies provide information about local DM clumps (e.g., from DM subhalos). Using precise astrometric data from the Gaia Mission, which enables clean selections of Milky Way stream stars, we now know of a few streams with perturbations and density anomalies. A full accounting of the density tracks and substructures within all >100 Milky Way stellar streams will therefore enable powerful new constraints on DM. However, methods for discovering and characterizing membership of streams are heterogeneous and often highly customized to individual streams. Here we present a new, flexible framework for modeling stellar stream density and membership. Our framework allows us to include off-track or non-Gaussian components to the stream density, meaning we can capture anomalous features (such as the GD-1 steam's spur). We test our model on GD-1, where we characterize previously-known features and provide the largest catalog of probable member stars to date (1689 stars). Our framework (built on JAX and numpyro) provides a path toward uniform analysis of all Milky Way streams, enabling tight constraints on the Galactic mass distribution and its dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Venus' atmosphere -- specifically its clouds buoyed up 40 to 60 km above the surface -- has long been suspected to encompass a biosphere where Earth-like living organisms could grow and flourish. This idea has been recently rekindled by the observation (signal-to-noise ratio of about 15$\sigma$) of a phosphine (PH$_3$) absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere. There is a chance that this observation could be a sign of life, because the PH$_3$ gas observed on Earth originates mostly in decaying organic material. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is no other natural process on Venus that could otherwise produce the observed PH$_3$ absorption line. On the other hand, cosmic rays and the particle cascades they produce in the Earth's atmosphere are hazardous to living organisms, because the ionizing radiation produced in air showers can blow apart chemical molecules and disrupt biochemical processes, causing cells to die or undergo dangerous mutations. Compared to Earth, the hypothesized biosphere of Venus could be exposed to substantially more ionizing radiation. This is because Venus has no protective intrinsic magnetic field, orbits closer to the Sun, and the entire eventual habitable region lies in the clouds high in the atmosphere. Thereby, if the clouds were sterilized there would be no reservoir of deeper life that can recolonize afterwards. In this communication we study the effects of particle cascades in the venusian atmosphere using the AIRES simulation package properly configured. We show that the effects of cosmic radiation in the habitable zone would be comparable to those on the Earth's surface and so would not have any hazardous effect on possible venusian microorganisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova is a topic of active research. The core of a supernova is an intense source of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Self-interaction among neutrinos (as well as antineutrinos) gives rise to a rich phenomenology not seen in terrestrial situations. In studies of the dynamics of flavor evolution in such environments, the gravitational effects are generally ignored. Although the curvature outside a dense core does not deviate much from a flat space, the spin of the neutrinos can still couple to the torsion of the spacetime. These extra degrees of freedom of curved spacetime have interaction strengths that are proportional to the density of the neutrinos and the other fermions \cite{Chakrabarty:2019cau} \cite{Barick:2023qjq} as well as the coupling constants of the spin-torsion interaction. We have studied the effects of such interactions in flavor evolution inside a core-collapse supernova \cite{Ghose:Manuscript}. The self-interaction gets modified by the spin-torsion interaction and the oscillation dynamics is modified. We have seen that there are noticeable changes in the flavor dynamics when the neutrino density is uniform. We have also studied the effects of such interaction in a realistic core-collapse supernova (CCSN). As neutrino astronomy enters the precision era, this study will shed light on the potential of neutrino fluxes from CCSN to probe the neutrino-neutrino interaction.

 - **Abstract**
 T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4 and NH3, which exhibit a wealth of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4$\sigma$ and 9.5$\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing ($K_{zz}\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature derivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.
#### Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: Corona Australis 151, the densest pre-stellar core or the youngest protostar?

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Pre-stellar cores are the birthplaces of Sun-like stars and represent the initial conditions for the assembly of protoplanetary systems. Due to their short lifespans, they are rare. In recent efforts to increase the number of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected a sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the Herschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that stands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use molecular lines that trace dense gas (n>=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the exceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and to understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4 transitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We use the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the core's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five lines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very high densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We infer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect several other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also detect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of high-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and the fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing frequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall motions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or as the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO). *SHORTENED*

 - **Abstract**
 The direction of extensive air showers can be used to determine the source of gamma quanta and plays an important role in estimating the energy of the primary particle. The data from an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detector stations HiSCORE in the TAIGA experiment registering the number of photoelectrons and detection time can be used to estimate the shower direction with high accuracy. In this work, we use artificial neural networks trained on Monte Carlo-simulated TAIGA HiSCORE data for gamma quanta to obtain shower direction estimates. The neural networks are multilayer perceptrons with skip connections using partial data from several HiSCORE stations as inputs; composite estimates are derived from multiple individual estimates by the neural networks. We apply a two-stage algorithm in which the direction estimates obtained in the first stage are used to transform the input data and refine the estimates. The mean error of the final estimates is less than 0.25 degrees. The approach will be used for multimodal analysis of the data from several types of detectors used in the TAIGA experiment.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: We characterize and quantify this multi-scale flow for a prototypical high-mass star-forming region. Methods: In a multi-scale analysis from parsec to ~50au scales, we combined multiple single-dish and interferometric observations to study the gas flow from large-scale sizes of several parsec (Mopra) via intermediate-scale filamentary gas flows (ALMA-IMF) to the central cores (ALMA DIHCA and configuration 10 data). The highest-resolution multi-configuration ALMA dataset achieved a spatial resolution of 0.027''x0.022'' or 50au. Results: This multi-scale study allows us to follow the gas from the environment of the high-mass star-forming region (~2pc) via intermediate-scale (~0.25pc) filamentary gas flows down to the innermost cores within the central few 1000au. The intermediate-scale filaments connect spatially and kinematically to the larger-scale cloud as well as the innermost cores. We estimate a filamentary mass inflow rate around 10^-3M_sun/yr, feeding into the central region that hosts at least a dozen mm cores. While the flow from the cloud via the filaments down to 10^4au appears relatively ordered, within the central 10^4au the kinematic structures become much more complicated and disordered. We speculate that this is caused by the interplay of the converging infalling gas with feedback processes from the forming central protostars. Conclusions: This multi-scale study characterises and quantifies the hierarchical gas flow from clouds down to the central protostars for a prototypical infrared dark cloud with several embedded cores at an unprecedented detail. While comparatively ordered gas flows are found over a broad range of scales, the innermost area exhibits more disordered structures, likely caused by the combination of inflow, outflow and cluster dynamical processes.
