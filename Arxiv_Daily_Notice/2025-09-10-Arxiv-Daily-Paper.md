 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs that are short period ($<10\,$day) companions to actively flaring M dwarfs may provide a context to directly observe flare-driven photochemistry and structural changes in an extrasolar planet-like atmosphere. To assess the viability of directly observing flare impacts in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf, we perform self-consistent temperature-chemistry modeling of the atmospheric response to individual energetic superflares. We modified the existing open-source \texttt{VULCAN} chemical-kinetics and \texttt{HELIOS} radiative-transfer codes for this purpose. Similar to previous studies of flare impacts on hydrogen dominated atmospheres, we find flares are capable of orders-of-magnitude changes in the mixing abundances of many chemical species, including important opacity sources like CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. However, due to fast chemical timescales resulting from high temperatures and densities in brown dwarf atmospheres, these changes last for a short-period of time, generally less than a day, and are only plausibly observable via high resolution emission spectroscopy. We find that the most observable, short-term spectral changes in hot (T$_{\text{eff}}\sim2000\,$K), high-gravity ($\log{\text{g}}\sim5$), cloudless brown dwarfs are the photolysis of H$_2$O and enhancement of CO$_2$, which can result in part-per-thousands spectral changes in the hours after a flare.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\sim100$) and the high-resolution grating ($R\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\sim$7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85--545 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \textit{JWST} data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\rm \log(M_{BH}/(M_{\odot}))=9.2\pm 0.2$ and $\rm \log(L_{bol}/(erg \, s^{-1}))=46.8\pm 0.1$, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of $\rm \lambda_{Edd}\sim 0.4$, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.
#### A galactic tug-of-war: how (not) to simultaneously fit the Milky Way satellite luminosity function and the mass-metallicity relation

 - **Abstract**
 The satellite population of the Milky Way is shaped by a range of astrophysical processes including mergers, star formation, feedback, and cosmic reionisation. Determining which processes most strongly influence its properties is challenging and a key test of galaxy formation models. We train a neural network on the GALFORM semi-analytic model and apply a variance-based sensitivity analysis to characterise the influence of 11 astrophysical parameters on two key observables: the satellite luminosity function, and the mass-metallicity relation. We find that: (1) the abundance of bright satellites ($\mathrm{M}_V \lesssim -13$) is regulated primarily by supernova feedback; (2) the faint end of the luminosity function is shaped by the interplay between feedback and reionisation; and (3) the mass-metallicity relation is governed almost exclusively by feedback at all masses. We are unable to find a combination of parameters in the fiducial model that fits the observed data for both statistics simultaneously. To understand why, we employ SHapley Additive exPlanations to capture the directionality of each parameter variation. This enables us to pinpoint the origin of tensions in the model, showing that parameter adjustments that regulate the abundance of faint satellites drive stellar metallicities to be an order of magnitude too low and vice versa. This internal "tug-of-war" leads us to consider extensions to the baseline model, such as metal loading in winds, or allowing the feedback strength to evolve with redshift. Our study highlights the value of interrogating complex physical models through a sensitivity analysis framework by revealing high-order parameter interactions and non-linear responses that traditional one-at-a-time variations would miss.
#### Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Observational Perspectives on Structure, Kinematics, and Lifetime

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07083

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze an ensemble of simulated prestellar cores to facilitate interpretation of structure, kinematics, and lifetime of observed cores. While our theory predicts a "characteristic" density for star formation, it also predicts that the individual critical density varies among cores; any observed sample thus contains cores at various evolutionary stages within a given density bin. By analyzing the remaining lifetime, we find cores undergoing quasi-equilibrium collapse evolve on a timescale of twice the freefall time throughout most of their life. Our analysis shows that the central column density and the associated full-width half maximum provide a reasonably accurate observational estimator of the central volume density, and therefore the freefall time; this does, however require resolving the central column density plateau. Observations with a finite beam size tend to underestimate densities of evolved cores, and this makes observed lifetimes appear to decrease more steeply than the apparent freefall time. We measure from our simulations the ratio of prestellar duration to envelope infall time, and find this is consistent with the observed relative number of prestellar cores and embedded protostars. Yet, the absolute core lifetime in our simulations is significantly shorter than would be expected from empirical measurements of the relative numbers of prestellar cores and Class II sources; we discuss several possible reasons for this discrepancy. Finally, our simulated cores have nearly constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion within the emitting region in the sky plane, resembling observed "coherent cores." We show that this "coherence" is a consequence of projection effects, which mask the intrinsic power-law velocity structure function. We discuss possible ways to estimate line-of-sight path lengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (< au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.
#### First look at Vela X-1 with XRISM: A simultaneous campaign with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) serve as useful laboratories for exploring the behaviour of accreted matter onto compact objects and for probing the complex wind environments of massive stars. These investigations are essential for understanding stellar life cycles and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and they are prominent topics in the science cases for XRISM and NewAthena. We report, for the first time, a XRISM observation of the HMXB Vela X-1, conducted during the first cycle of the XRISM general observer programme and complemented by simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coverage. This campaign targeted a critical orbital phase -- when the neutron star is in inferior conjunction -- during which significant changes in absorption are expected. We performed absorption-resolved spectral analyses during two time intervals of interest: the soft and hard hardness ratio (HR) intervals, as it is strongly correlated with absorption variability. We observed a sudden transition in the HR from a soft to a hard state, coinciding with an increase in the absorption column density. This is likely attributed to the onset of the accretion structure crossing our line of sight. With XRISM/Resolve, we also investigated the Fe K region, and we report for the first time the presence of a Fe K$\alpha$ doublet in the spectrum of Vela X-1, together with the presence of already known Fe K$\beta$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines that are produced in cold clumps embedded in the hot ionised wind. The measured line velocities of the order of $10^2 \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with production sites in the vicinity of the neutron star. This precursor study with Vela X-1 shows the potential of XRISM in studying in unprecedented details the spectral evolution of wind-accreting X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SNe-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that SNRs radiate incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation, localized at the interface where the hot and warm plasma phases mix near the cooling radius. I provide evidence that this process is seeded by a Vishniac (1994)-type instability, which corrugates and folds the interface. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism described and measured in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $\propto k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable SNR layer, can imprint itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale instabilities in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive 3D dust reddening map covering the entire Milky Way, constructed by combining reddening estimates based on LAMOST low-resolution spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$) with those derived from $Gaia$ XP spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$), along with revised $Gaia$ distances. E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$ values of $\sim$ 4.6 million unique sources were obtained with the standard-pair analysis using LAMOST DR11 stellar parameters and synthesized $B/V$-band photometry from $Gaia$ XP spectra, showing a typical precision of $\sim$ 0.01 mag. The E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$ from the catalog of \citet{zhang2023}, which was derived using forward modeling of $Gaia$ XP spectra, were cross-validated with E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$, leading to the selection of $\sim$ 150 million high-reliability measurements. The combined dataset achieves a median precision of $\sim$ 0.03 mag for E(B$-$V). To model the reddening -- distance relationship along various lines-of-sight, we implemented a parametric approach that accounts for contributions from the local bubble, diffuse interstellar-medium, and multiple potential molecular clouds. The sky was adaptively partitioned based on stellar density, resulting in angular resolutions ranging from 3.4$^{\prime}$ to 58$^{\prime}$, with about half of the sky having a resolution better than 6.9$^{\prime}$. The reddening precision of our 3D map for individual stars reaches $\sim$ 0.01 mag in most regions at $|b| > 20^\circ$, but degrades to 0.01-0.05 mag at $|b| < 20^\circ$. The map reaches a maximum distance of 3-5 kpc in high-extinction regions with $|b| < 5^\circ$, and extends to 10-15 kpc elsewhere. An interactive platform and Python package have been developed for utilization of the 3D dust map. Available online: this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the distribution and properties of molecular clouds is crucial for tracing the structure and evolution of the interstellar medium and the large-scale morphology of the Milky Way. Here we present an all-sky catalog of 3,345 molecular clouds identified from our previous three-dimensional dust reddening map using a dendrogram-based clustering method with distance-adaptive parameters. The catalog spans heliocentric distances from 90 pc to 4.3 kpc and includes key physical properties for each cloud, including position, size, mass, surface density, and dust density. Approximately 650 clouds in our catalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740 clouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high Galactic latitudes ($|b| > 20^\circ$). The spatial distribution of the cataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk, including coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more detailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our understanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and provide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble. The catalog serves as a valuable resource for future studies of star formation, Galactic structure, and the interaction between molecular clouds and large-scale ISM features.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of theories have been put forward to explain the bi-modal stellar rotational distribution observed in young massive clusters. These include stellar mergers and interactions induced in binary systems, and the role of angular momentum transfer between a star and its circumstellar disk in its early evolution. Each theory predicts unique rotation distributions in various locations of the colour-magnitude diagram. Specifically, the stellar merger hypothesis posits that the upper end of the main sequence will host a significant number of slowly rotating merger products, essentially that the blue straggler stars are an extension of the blue main sequence. In the present work, we use observations of three massive ($\sim10^5$~\msun) young ($100-300$~Myr) clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud using a combination of HST photometry and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. We show that in all three clusters, these bright blue stars have stellar rotational distributions that differ significantly from that measured on the blue main sequence. We conclude that stellar mergers do not play a significant role in the formation of the split main sequence/bi-modal rotational distribution. As a corollary, we show that blue straggler stars in these YMCs display a wide range of rotational velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.
