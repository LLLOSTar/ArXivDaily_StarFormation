 - **Abstract**
 As humanity advances toward long-term lunar presence under NASA's Artemis program, the development of lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC) capabilities has become increasingly critical. The high cost of transporting materials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with lunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility, material efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This study investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) composites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS). PEEK and LMS-1D powders were melt-compounded via twin-screw extrusion, printed using a high-temperature chamber, and annealed at 300 degrees C. The samples were characterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing, and microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities above 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK to 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation enhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while reducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and print success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa up to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%. Annealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt% LRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental analyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith particles. This work establishes processing windows and trade-offs for regolith-rich PEEK composites, supporting ISRU-enabled AM of future lunar infrastructure.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of Pegasus V and Pisces VII, along with a re-analysis of the archival imaging of Pegasus W, and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) neutral gas (HI) observations of all three. These three ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) are all within the Local Group in the approximate direction of M31. The VLA observations place stringent upper limits on their HI content, with all having $M_\mathrm{HI} < 10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$. As the red giant branches of these UFDs are sparsely populated, we determined distances from the HST photometry of horizontal branch (HB) stars in comparison to a fiducial HB population (from M92), with all three falling in the range 0.7-1 Mpc. Using a new Python-based star formation history (SFH) fitting code (based on StarFISH), we derive SFHs of all three UFDs. As found previously, the best fit SFH for Pegasus W includes significant star formation well beyond the end of reionization, while the SFHs calculated for Pegasus V and Pisces VII are consistent with them having quenched shortly after reionization. These findings for the latter two objects indicate that, like those in the vicinity of the Milky Way, lower mass UFDs in the vicinity of M31 likely quenched at early times.
#### HST Observations of the CV Propeller LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9

 - **Abstract**
 We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) FUV spectra and light curves of the magnetic cataclysmic variable (CV) LAMOST J024048.51+195226.9 (J0240), the second known CV propeller. The five consecutive HST orbits span a full 7.34 hour binary orbital period. We detect a 24.939 $\pm$ 0.006 s FUV modulation, confirming that J0240 contains the fastest spinning white dwarf (WD) in a CV. A high N V/C IV emission line ratio is considered an indicator of a recent episode of thermal time-scale mass transfer. The observed ratio in J0240 is higher than seen in typical magnetic CVs, but far less than observed in the only other confirmed propeller, AE Aquarii (AE Aqr). We also find that J0240 is significantly less luminous than AE Aqr during both low- and high-flux states. Around orbital phase 0.5, the Si IV emission line displays a P-Cygni absorption profile likely related to the gas accelerated in the propeller. We derive new mass-dependent temperature limits for the surface temperature of the WD of T $\leq$ 11,000-15,000 K. This temperature is low enough to allow for WD core crystallization, which may be linked to magnetism in WDs, particularly those in CVs.

 - **Abstract**
 By fitting the tilt in the path of the Orphan-Chenab Stream (OCS), we conclude that the current mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) within 30 kpc is $4.7$ - $5.1 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We note that the tidal radius of the LMC of this mass is 16.9 kpc, indicating that our measured mass approximates the current bound mass of the LMC. Previous measurements of the LMC mass based on fitting the observed path of the OCS through the Milky Way (MW) halo reported the total mass of the LMC. We show that because the closest approach of the LMC to the OCS, where the gravitational perturbation of the stream path is the highest, is about 20 kpc, the mass of the LMC outside of 30 kpc is not constrained and depends entirely on the assumed radial profile at large radius. Our best-fit total mass varies between $4.5 \times 10^{10}$ and $2.2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ or more, depending on the presumed radial profile of the LMC. We also show that previous measurements of the mass of the LMC that used a particle-spray method to simulate the path of the OCS suffered from systematic error because they assumed that all particles were stripped from the dwarf galaxy at the tidal radius; N-body simulations show that particles are actually released from a range of distances from the center of mass of the OCS. In contrast, the choice of MW potential has little effect on the estimated LMC mass from the OCS.

 - **Abstract**
 Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is the youngest known core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) in the Galaxy and is perhaps the best-studied SNR in X-rays. Cas A has a line-rich spectrum dominated by thermal emission and given its high flux, it is an appealing target for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. Cas A was observed at two different locations during the Performance Verification phase of the XRISM mission, one location in the southeastern part (SE) of the remnant and one in the northwestern part (NW). This paper serves as an overview of these observations and discusses some of the issues relevant for the analysis of the data. We present maps of the so-called ``spatial-spectral mixing'' effect due to the fact that the XRISM point-spread function is larger than a pixel in the Resolve calorimeter array. We analyze spectra from two bright, on-axis regions such that the effects of spatial-spectral mixing are minimized. We find that it is critical to include redshifts/blueshifts and broadening of the emission lines in the two thermal components to achieve a reasonable fit given the high spectral resolution of the Resolve calorimeter. We fit the spectra with two versions of the AtomDB atomic database (3.0.9 and 3.1.0) and two versions of the SPEX (3.08.00 and 3.08.01*) spectral fitting software. Overall we find good agreement between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* for the spectral models considered in this paper. The most significant difference we found between AtomDB 3.0.9 and 3.1.0 and between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* is the Ni abundance, with the new atomic data favoring a considerably lower (up to a factor of 3) Ni abundance. Both regions exhibit significantly enhanced abundances compared to Solar values indicating that supernova ejecta dominate the emission in these regions. We find that the abundance ratios of Ti/Fe, Mn/Fe, \& Ni/Fe are significantly lower in the NW than the SE.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the 2025 release of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, highlighting significant enhancements to the scope and accuracy of the physics which have been made since the previous release. A major part of this development involves resolving the Lyman $\alpha$ line into $j$-resolved fine-structure doublets, making Cloudy of use to the X-ray community. On this front, we have also updated inner-shell ionization line energies and incorporated the 1 keV feature commonly observed in X-ray binaries. Additionally, we update our in-house database, Stout, for the carbon isoelectronic sequence, improving Cloudy microphysical calculations for all wavelengths. We have also extended the molecular network by adding new silicon-bearing species, titanium-related reactions, and phosphorus-containing molecules, enhancing Cloudy's ability to model the complex chemistry relevant to rapidly growing field of exoplanet atmospheres. Finally, we outline future developments aimed at maximizing the scientific return from the current and upcoming generation of observatories, including XRISM, JWST, Roman, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and NewAthena.
#### Equation vs. AI: Predict Density and Measure Width of molecular clouds by Multiscale Decomposition

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar medium widely exists in the universe at multi-scales. In this study, we introduce the {\it Multi-scale Decomposition Reconstruction} method, an equation-based model designed to derive width maps of interstellar medium structures and predict their volume density distribution in the plane of the sky from input column density data. This approach applies the {\it Constrained Diffusion Algorithm}, based on a simple yet common physical picture: as molecular clouds evolve to form stars, the density of interstellar medium increases while their scale decreases. Extensive testing on simulations confirms that this method accurately predicts volume density with minimal error. Notably, the equation-based model performs comparably or even more accurately than the AI-based DDPM model(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), which relies on numerous parameters and high computational resources. Unlike the "black-box" nature of AI, our equation-based model offers full transparency, making it easier to interpret, debug, and validate. Their simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency make them indispensable not only for understanding complex astrophysical phenomena but also for complementing and enhancing AI-based methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs is crucial for understanding their atmospheric physics and chemistry, searching for biosignatures, and investigating their formation histories. Recent advances in observational techniques, combining adaptive optics with high-resolution spectrographs, have enabled detailed spectroscopic analysis for directly imaged faint companions. In this paper, we report an atmospheric retrieval on the L-type brown dwarf HR 7672 B using a near-infrared high-contrast high-resolution spectrograph, REACH (Y, J, H band, $R\sim100,000$), which combines SCExAO with IRD at the Subaru Telescope. Our model, developed based on the ExoJAX spectrum code, simultaneously accounts for several factors, including the presence of clouds in the L dwarf's atmosphere as well as contamination from the host star's light and telluric absorption lines in the observed spectra. Our analysis identified H2O and FeH as the primary absorbers in the observed J- and H-band spectra. Additionally, the observed features were reproduced with a model that includes cloud opacity, assuming an optically thick cloud at the pressure $P_\mathrm{top}$. The resulting temperature at the cloud top pressure suggests the potential formation of clouds composed of TiO2, Al2O3, or Fe. This study is the first science demonstration for faint spectra obtained by REACH, providing a foundation for future investigations into the atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic millisecond-duration signals which encode otherwise unattainable information on the plasma which permeates our Universe, providing insights into magnetic fields and gas distributions. Here we report the discovery of FRB 20240304B originating at redshift 2.148 +/- 0.001 corresponding to just 3 billion years after the Big Bang. FRB 2024030 was detected with the MeerKAT radio telescope and localized to a low-mass, clumpy, star forming galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery doubles the redshift reach of localized FRBs and probes ionized baryons across ~80% of cosmic history. Its sightline, intersecting the Virgo Cluster and a foreground group, reveals magnetic field complexity over many gigaparsec scales. Our observations establish FRB activity during the peak of cosmic star formation and demonstrate that FRBs can probe galaxy formation during the most active era in cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.
#### On the formation of multiple dust-trapping rings in the inner Solar system

 - **Abstract**
 Isotopic properties of meteorites provide evidence that multiple dust trap or pressure bumps had to form and persist in the inner Solar System on a timescale of millions of years. The formation of a pressure bump at the outer edge of the gap opened by Jupiter blocks particles drifting from the outer to the inner disk. This is not enough to preserve dust in the inner disk. However, in low viscosity disks, under specific condition on the gas cooling time, massive planets can also open secondary gaps, separated by density bumps, inward of the main gap. The majority of studies have been done in two dimensional equatorial simulations with prescribed disk cooling. Recent results have shown that including the treatment of radiation transport is key to determine the formation of secondary gaps. We extend previous studies to three dimensional disks including radiative effects and we also consider non ideal MHD effects, in disks with prescribed cooling time. We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations with self consistent treatment of radiative effects and including the magnetic field with non ideal Ohmic and Ambipolar effects. We show that in a disk with low bulk viscosity and consistent treatment of radiative effects, planetary masses close to the pebble isolation mass as well as a Jupiter massive planet open multiple gaps. In the presence of non ideal MHD effects multiple gaps and rings are also formed by a Jupiter massive this http URL conclusion the formation of multiple gaps and rings inside the planetary orbit is crucial to preserve dust reservoirs. Such reservoirs are pushed towards the inner part of the disk during Jupiter runaway growth and are persistent after Jupiter's growth. Multiple dust reservoirs could therefore be present in the inner Solar System since the formation of Jupiter's solid core if the disk had low-viscosity.
#### Spectroscopic Confirmation: Fast rotators in the young clusters NGC 1856 and NGC 1953

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a spectroscopic investigation of two Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, NGC 1953 and NGC 1856. Both clusters have similar ages (250 and 300 Myr, respectively). Spectra were recorded with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System located on the Magellan-Clay 6.5m telescope. Spectra were visually inspected to assess the presence of stellar H$\alpha$ emission lines attributed to B stars rotating close to breakup velocity (Be stars). High fractions of Be stars in the cluster typically indicate the presence of a large population of fast rotating stars, predicted by some models to explain the observed split and extended main sequence. There are numerous Be star candidates in NGC 1856, exhibiting weak but broad H$\alpha$ emission. However, only one such target was detected in NGC 1953. This stark contrast between the observed populations for NGC 1856 and NGC 1953 may suggest that cluster density plays a key role in determining the fraction of Be stars. These results provide essential constraints for the different scenarios attempting to explain the bimodal distribution of rotational velocities and the multiple populations of stars observed in globular clusters. The impact of stellar radial velocity and nebular emission on photometric measures is assessed through simulations relying on the spectra. These simulations suggest that photometric studies can under-estimate the fraction of H$\alpha$ emitters in a cluster, in particular for stars with relatively weak emission features. The results also show that nebular emission has minimal impact on the photometric H$\alpha$ excesses.
#### Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\,2024ggi from 250 and 420 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \textÅ doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at $2.3$ $\mu$m from 250 to 319 days in the NIR.
