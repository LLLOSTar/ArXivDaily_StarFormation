#### A possible wave-optical effect in lensed FRBs

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic bursts whose properties are still largely unknown, but based on their extremely small time duration, they are proposed to have a compact structure, making them candidates for wave-optical effects if gravitational lensed. If an FRB is lensed into multiple-images bursts at different times by a galaxy or cluster, a likely scenario is that only one image is detected, because the others fall outside the survey area and time frame. Aims: In this work we explore the FRB analog of quasar microlensing, namely the collective microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy, now with wave optics included. The eikonal regime is applicable here. Methods. We study the voltage (rather than the intensity) in a simple simulation consisting of (a) microlensing stars, and (b) plasma scattering by a turbulent interstellar medium. Results: The auto-correlation of the voltage shows peaks (at order-microsecond separations) corresponding to wave-optical interference between lensed micro-images. The peaks are frequency dependent if plasma-scattering is significant. While qualitative and still in need of more realistic simulations, the results suggest that a strongly-lensed FRB could be identified from a single image. Conclusions: Microlensing could sniff out macro-lensed FRBs
#### Do We Know How to Model Reionization?

 - **Abstract**
 I compare the power spectra of the radiation fields from two recent sets of fully-coupled simulations that model cosmic reionization: "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and "Thesan". While both simulations have similar power spectra of the radiation sources, the power spectra of the photoionization rate are significantly different at the same values of cosmic time or the same values of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction. However, the power spectra of the photoionization rate can be matched at large scales for the two simulations when the matching snapshots are allowed to vary independently. I.e., on large scales, the radiation field in two simulations proceeds through the same evolutionary stages, but the timing of these stages is different in different simulations and is not parameterized by an easily interpretable physical quantity like the mean neutral fraction or the mean free path. On small scales, large differences are present and remain partially unexplained. Both CROC and Thesan use the Variable Eddington Tensor approximation for modeling radiative transfer, but adopt different closure relations (optically thin OTVET versus M1). The role of this key difference is tested by using smaller simulations with a new cosmological simulation code that implements both closure relations in a controlled environment (the same hydro, cooling, and gravity solvers and the star formation recipe). In these controlled tests, both the M1 closure and the OTVET ansatz follow the expected behavior from a simple analytical approximation, demonstrating that the differences in the 2-point function of the radiation field induced by the choice of the Eddington tensor are not dominant.
#### A $ν$ look at the Sun: Probing the conditions of the solar core using $^8$B neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 In the coming age of precision neutrino physics, neutrinos from the Sun become robust probes of the conditions of the solar core. Here, we focus on $^8$B neutrinos, for which there are already high precision measurements by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory and Super-Kamiokande. Using only basic physical principles and straightforward statistical tools, we calculate projected constraints on the temperature and density of the $^8$B neutrino production zone compared to a reference solar model. We outline how to better understand the astrophysics of the solar interior using forthcoming neutrino data and solar models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the elemental abundances distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 cluster using {\it XMM-Newton} observations. This analysis uses EPIC-pn data, including a new energy scale calibration, which allows us to measure velocities with uncertainties down to $\Delta v \sim 80$ km/s, and MOS observations. We measured radial O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe profiles. This is the first study of elemental abundances beyond Fe using X-ray observations within the A3266 cluster. The abundance profiles display discontinuities similar to those obtained for the temperature. We modeled the X/Fe ratio profiles with a linear combination of type~Ia supernovae (SNIa) and core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) models. We found that the SNIa ratio over the total cluster enrichment tends to be uniform, with a $42\pm 5\%$ contribution. Such a trend supports an early ICM enrichment scenario, with most metals produced before clustering.
#### The nature of spectral variability of the accreting pulsar Centaurus X-3 unveiled by NuSTAR observation covering two orbital cycles

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a $369\;{\rm ks}$ NuSTAR observation on the X-ray pulsar Centaurus X-3, which covered two consecutive orbital cycles of the source, including two eclipse durations. We investigated the orbital-phase spectral variability over the two orbital cycles. We divided the entire observation data into multiple segments, each covering an orbital interval of $\Delta\Phi=0.005$. The phenomenological spectral modeling applied to these orbital-phase-resolved spectra reveals that the photon index is the key parameter with the most variability and a strong correlation with the continuum flux. The photon index becomes softer during the high-flux phases and harder in the low-flux phases. The relation between the photon index and continuum flux remains consistent when investigating specific spin phases, suggesting that the spectral variability originates from extrinsic factors apart from the neutron star. Furthermore, the 3-5 keV pulse fraction also exhibits variability, being enhanced in the high-flux phases and suppressed in the low-flux phases, which indicates the presence of multiple emission components with different pulse fractions. These phenomenological analysis results enabled us to estimate the physical origin of the spectral variability. We successfully fitted the orbital-phase-resolved spectra with a physical model that assumes (1) stable emission from the neutron star, (2) attenuation by inhomogeneous, clumpy stellar wind, and (3) an additional non-pulsed emission component arising from thermal emission from the accretion disk. The thermal emission from the accretion disk can be described by a blackbody with a temperature of $kT\sim0.5\;{\rm keV}$ and a luminosity of $\sim10^{37}\;{\rm erg\;s^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.
#### Interstellar scintillation of sources B0821+394 and B1812+412 as observed by the LPA LPI radio telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The search for long-term variability of compact components of radio sources B0821+394 and B1812+412 over an interval of 10 years was carried out. The LPA LPI radio telescope with an operating frequency of 111 MHz was used for observations. According to our estimates, the characteristic time of variability for both sources is 1.5-2.5 years. It is shown that the observed variability is not related to intrinsic variations in the radiation flux, but is due to refractive scintillation on inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium. From the obtained upper estimates of the apparent angular dimensions of the sources, it follows that the main contribution to the scattering of radio emission is made by turbulent plasma concentrated in sufficiently thin screens, the distance to which does not exceed 300-400 pc.
#### Keplerian motion of a compact source orbiting the inner disk of PDS 70: A third protoplanet in a resonance with b and c?

 - **Abstract**
 The disk around PDS 70 hosts two directly imaged protoplanets in a gap. Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at ~13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b. We reduce seven published and one unpublished VLT/SPHERE datasets in YJH and K bands, as well as an archival VLT/NaCo dataset in L' band, and an archival VLT/SINFONI dataset in H+K band. We combine angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all epochs, consistent with the JWST detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet which could be in a resonance with PDS 70 b & c. We find that the spectral slope is overall consistent with the unresolved star and inner disk emission at 0.95--1.65$\mu$m, which suggests a dust scattering dominated spectrum. An excess beyond 2.3$\mu$m could be thermal emission from either a protoplanet or heated circumplanetary dust, variability, or inner disk contamination, and requires confirmation. While we currently cannot rule out a moving inner disk feature or a dust clump associated with an unseen planet, the data supports the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the reporting of extensive and luminous star-forming regions associated with explosive outflows. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding of the possible physical mechanisms that produce such energetic and isotropic events. Then, we propose a gravitational interaction as a likely mechanism that could trigger explosive outflows in dense star-forming regions. This could constrain the physical conditions that generate an explosive outflow produced by the close dynamical encounter of a runaway star with a clump cluster in dynamical equilibrium. Then, we have produced a set of $N$-body simulations that account for the collision of a 10M$_\odot$ stellar object with a cluster of particles with a mass that ranges from 0 to 50 \msun. We propose a parameter to describe the interaction, the evaporation parameter, that represents the fraction of stars that become unbound. The main result is that, when the cluster mass is less than, or up to a few times the stellar mass, the collision will produce an explosive outflow, ejecting a significant fraction of the cluster members with velocities larger than the impact velocity. All of our models produce an explosive outflow, with different characteristics, which increases the probability that a close encounter could be responsible for producing the observed flows.
#### The morphology of supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 implies explosion by jittering-jets

 - **Abstract**
 I examine the morphology of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1 and reveal a point-symmetrical morphology that implies shaping by three or more pairs of jets, as expected in the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The large northwest protrusion, the ear (or lobe), has two bright rims. I compare this ear with its rims to an ear with three rims of a jet-shaped planetary nebula and jets from an active galactic nucleus that shaped several rims on one side. Based on this similarity, I argue that two jets or more shaped the northwest ear of SNR G0.9+0.1 and its two rims. I identified the bright region south of the main shell of SNR G0.9+0.1 as a jet-shaped blowout formed by a jet that broke out from the main SNR shell. I base this on the similarity of the blowout of SNR G0.9+0.1 with that of SNR G309.2-00.6, argued in the past to be shaped by jets. I identify four symmetry axes along different directions that compose the point-symmetric morphology of SNR G0.9+0.1. I show that the morphological features of holes, granular texture, and random filaments exist in CCSNe and planetary nebulae and are unlikely to result from some unique processes in CCSNe. These structures result from similar instabilities in the JJEM and the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism and, unlike a point-symmetric morphology, cannot determine the explosion mechanism. Identifying SNR G0.9+0.1 as a new point-symmetric CCSN strengthens the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.
