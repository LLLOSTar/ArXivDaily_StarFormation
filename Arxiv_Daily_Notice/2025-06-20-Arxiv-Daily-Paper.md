 - **Abstract**
 Due to dust grain alignment with magnetic fields, dust polarization observations of far-infrared emission from cold molecular clouds are often used to trace magnetic fields, allowing a probe of the effects of magnetic fields on the star formation process. We present inferred magnetic field maps of the Pillars of Creation region within the larger M16 emission nebula, derived from dust polarization data in the 89 and 154 micron continuum using SOFIA/HAWC+. We derive magnetic field strength estimates using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We compare the polarization and magnetic field strengths to column densities and dust continuum intensities across the region to build a coherent picture of the relationship between star forming activity and magnetic fields in the region. The projected magnetic field strengths derived are in the range of 50-130 microGauss, which is typical for clouds of similar n(H2), i.e., molecular hydrogen volume density on the order of 10^4-10^5 cm^(-3). We conclude that star formation occurs in the finger tips when the magnetic fields are too weak to prevent radial collapse due to gravity but strong enough to oppose OB stellar radiation pressure, while in the base of the fingers the magnetic fields hinder mass accretion and consequently star formation. We also support an initial weak field model (<50 microGauss) with subsequent strengthening through realignment and compression, resulting in a dynamically important magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 253, the Sculptor galaxy, is the southern, massive, star-forming disk galaxy closest to the Milky Way. In this work, we present a new 103-pointing MUSE mosaic of this galaxy covering the majority of its star-forming disk up to 0.75xR25. With an area of ~20x5 arcmin2 (~20x5 kpc2, projected) and a physical resolution of ~15 pc, this mosaic constitutes one of the largest, highest physical resolution integral field spectroscopy surveys of any star-forming galaxy to date. Here, we exploit the mosaic to identify a sample of ~500 planetary nebulae (~20 times larger than in previous studies) to build the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) and obtain a new estimate of the distance to NGC 253. The value obtained is 17% higher than estimates returned by other reliable measurements, mainly obtained via the top of the red giant branch method (TRGB). The PNLF also varies between the centre (r < 4 kpc) and the disk of the galaxy. The distance derived from the PNLF of the outer disk is comparable to that of the full sample, while the PNLF of the centre returns a distance ~0.9 Mpc larger. Our analysis suggests that extinction related to the dust-rich interstellar medium and edge-on view of the galaxy (the average E(B-V) across the disk is ~0.35 mag) plays a major role in explaining both the larger distance recovered from the full PNLF and the difference between the PNLFs in the centre and in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich analysis of the narrow-line region (NLR) in the low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) I galaxy NGC 5005 using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband imaging of [O III]${\lambda}$5007, H${\beta}$, H${\alpha}$, and [S II]${\lambda}{\lambda}$6717,6731. With a resolution of ${\lesssim}$0.1 (${\lesssim}$10 pc at z = 0.003), we dissect the NLR into H II (star-forming), Seyfert, and LINERs across spatial scales extending up to r$\sim$8 kpc from the nucleus. Our results reveal a compact nuclear region exhibiting Seyfert-like emission, consistent with photoionization by a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Surrounding this Seyfert-like nucleus is a thin ($\sim$20 pc thick) higher-excitation LINER-like cocoon, likely arising from shock-excited gas in the interstellar medium (ISM). Beyond this cocoon, a centrally localized extended (r$\sim$1 kpc) LINER-like region surrounds the Seyfert-like nucleus and cocoon, likely ionized by the AGN, while a more extended (r${\gtrsim}$2 kpc) LINER-like zone may be ionized by a combination of post-AGB stars and shocks from gas inflows. We also detect H II-like regions at both small and large scales. In the inner 500 pc, these regions may be triggered by jet-ISM interactions, potentially inducing localized star formation. At r$\sim$4 kpc, we identify an outer H II-like region tracing a large-scale star-forming ring, where ionization is dominated by young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 A major issue in contemporary cosmology is the persistent discrepancy, known as the Hubble tension, between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) estimates from local measurements and those inferred from early-Universe observations under the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. Recent advances have identified fast radio bursts (FRBs), a class of extragalactic phenomena observable at considerable redshifts, as a promising observational tool for probing late-time cosmology. In this study, we incorporate two complementary methodologies, machine learning algorithms and Bayesian analysis, on a set of localized FRBs to rigorously test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM model at late cosmic epochs. Our results reveal a statistically significant redshift-dependent variation of $H_0$, which contradicts the core postulate of $\Lambda$CDM. We further validate that the redshift dependency of $H_0$ can be removed within the more flexible framework of $w_0w_a$CDM model. These findings highlight that the redshift evolution of $H_0$ is not merely an artifact of the standard model but an indication of a deeper inadequacy in the $\Lambda$CDM model, supporting the need for a more flexible cosmological framework.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the question of whether core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can produce rapid neutron capture process (r-process) elements and how future MeV gamma-ray observations could address this. Rare types of CCSNe characterized by substantial magnetic fields and rotation, known as magnetorotational supernovae (MR-SNe), are theoretically predicted to produce these elements, although direct observational evidence is lacking. We suggest that this critical question be addressed through the study of some of the eleven CCSN remnants located within 10 kpc, as well as through the detection of gamma-ray emission from a future Galactic supernova. We use a two-dimensional MR-SN model to estimate the expected gamma flux stemming from nuclear decays in the range of a few tens of keV to a few MeV. Our results indicate that an observation of Sn-126 (Sb-126) in a remnant stands out as a signature of an r-process-producing supernova. Since the neutron-rich conditions that lead to the production of the r-process could also enhance the production of Fe-60, the detection of substantial Fe-60 (Co-60) would be indicative of favorable conditions for the r-process. In the case of a future supernova explosion, when the evolution of the spectrum is studied over ten days to a few years, a rich picture emerges. At various epochs, second peak r-process isotopes such as Sb-125, I-131, Te-132, I-132 and La-140 produce gamma-ray signals that emerge above the background from explosive burning products and electron-positron annihilation. The weak r-process isotopes Nb-95, Ru-103, Rh-106 also have periods of prominence. While MR-SNe are predicted to have a relatively small main r-process contribution, third peak isotopes like Ir-194 could still be above next-generation MeV gamma instrument sensitivities.

 - **Abstract**
 WASP-4 b is a hot Jupiter exhibiting a decreasing orbital period, prompting investigations into potential mechanisms driving its evolution. We analyzed 173 transit light curves, including 37 new observations, and derived mid-transit timings with EXOFAST, forming the most extensive TTV dataset for this system. Adding 58 literature timings and removing unreliable data, we constructed a TTV diagram with 216 points. Our analysis considered linear, quadratic, and apsidal motion models, with the quadratic model proving to be significantly superior in all model comparison statistics. We found no significant periodic signals in the data. The quadratic model allows us to infer a tidal quality factor of Q' ~ 80,000 from the orbital decay rate if this is due to stellar tides. Theoretical considerations indicate that such efficient dissipation is possible due to internal gravity waves in the radiative core of WASP-4, but only in our models with a more evolved host star, possibly near the end of its main-sequence lifetime, and with a larger radius than the observed one. Our main-sequence models produce only about a third of the required dissipation (Q' ~ 200,000 - 500,000). Therefore, the observed orbital decay can only be explained by a slightly larger or more evolved host, resembling the case for WASP-12. Our findings highlight the need for further stellar modeling and improvement in our current understanding of tidal dissipation mechanisms driving orbital decay in close-in exoplanetary systems.
#### Galactic seismology: can the Gaia 'phase spiral' co-exist with a clumpy, turbulent interstellar medium?

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia satellite revealed a remarkable spiral pattern ('phase spiral', PS) in the z-Vz phase plane throughout the solar neighbourhood, where z and Vz are the displacement and velocity of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane. As demonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic stellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance in the recent past (~0.3-3 Gyr). However, previous controlled simulations did not consider the impact of the multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is crucial because it has been suggested that this weak signal is highly susceptible to scattering by small-scale density fluctuations typical of the ISM. This has motivated us to explore the formation and fate of the PS in a high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamical simulation of an idealised Galaxy analogue bearing a realistic ISM, which interacts impulsively with a massive perturber. In our models, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to drive turbulence. We find that the PS is almost non-existent if the ISM has an excess of power on sub-kiloparsec scales compared to longer wavelengths. This can happen in the absence of star formation and feedback when the gas is allowed to cool. In the presence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar feedback, the PS has a patchy spatial distribution and a high degree of intermittency on kiloparsec scales. We anticipate that future studies of the phase-spiral behaviour on all scales will provide crucial information on star-gas dynamics.
#### Study of a giant Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnant, Veliki (J0450.4-7050)

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution radio-continuum view and a multi-frequency analysis of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Supernova Remnant (SNR) J0450.4-7050, which we give the nickname Veliki. These high-resolution observations reveal a larger extent than previously measured, making J0450.4-7050 one of the largest SNRs that we know of. Additionally, we observe a higher than expected radio surface brightness and an unusually flat spectral index ($\alpha = -0.26 \pm 0.02$), with little spectral variation over the remnant. We observe a bright H$\alpha$ shell indicating significant cooling over the remnant, but also an excess of [Oiii] on the eastern shock front. We investigate several theoretical scenarios to explain the emission and radio evolution of J0450.4-7050 in the context of the LMC environment, and determine that this is most likely an older, predominantly radiative, SNR with a higher shock compression ratio, which gives a flatter non-thermal spectrum, in combination with a thermal (bremsstrahlung) emission contribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic hot gas emission is closely related to halo gas acquisition and galactic feedback processes. Their X-ray observations reveal important physical properties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However, the measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always include contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the target. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via different strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting theoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from intervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid of the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and estimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting galaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the intervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is gravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the diffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web structures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that permeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line emissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray band can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound to intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent galaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along the line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as measured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the emission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.
#### Massive stars exploding in a He-rich circumstellar medium. XI. Diverse evolution of five Ibn SNe 2020nxt, 2020taz, 2021bbv, 2023utc and 2024aej

 - **Abstract**
 We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of five Type Ibn supernovae (SNe): SN 2020nxt, SN 2020taz, SN 2021bbv, SN 2023utc, and SN 2024aej. These events share key observational features and belong to a family of objects similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc. The SNe exhibit rise times of approximately 10 days and peak absolute magnitudes ranging from $-$16.5 to $-$19 mag. Notably, SN 2023utc is the faintest Type Ibn supernova discovered to date, with an exceptionally low r-band absolute magnitude of $-16.4$ mag. The pseudo-bolometric light curves peak at $(1-10) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with total radiated energies on the order of $(1-10) \times 10^{48}$ erg. Spectroscopically, these SNe display relatively slow spectral evolution; the early spectra are characterised by a hot blue continuum and prominent He I emission lines. Early spectra show blackbody temperatures exceeding $10000~\mathrm{K}$, with a subsequent decline in temperature during later phases. Narrow He I lines, indicative of unshocked circumstellar material (CSM), show velocities of approximately $1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. The spectra suggest that the progenitors of these SNe underwent significant mass loss prior to the explosion, resulting in a He-rich CSM. Light curve modelling yields estimates for the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) in the range $1-3~M_{\odot}$, with kinetic energies ($E_{\rm Kin}$) of $(0.1-1) \times 10^{50}$ erg. The inferred CSM mass ranges from $0.2$ to $1~M_{\odot}$. These findings are consistent with expectations for core-collapse events arising from relatively massive, envelope-stripped progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) in solar-like young stellar objects (YSOs), particularly within protostellar disks, are of significant interest due to their potential connection to prebiotic chemistry in emerging planetary systems. We report the discovery of a rotating feature enriched in COMs, including CH3OH, CH3CHO, and NH2CHO, in the protostellar core G192.12-11.10. By constructing a YSO model, we find that the COM-rich feature is likely located within or near the boundary of the Keplerian disk. The image synthesis results suggest that additional heating mechanisms leading to a warm ring or a warm inner disk are required to reproduce the observed emission. We discuss possible origins of the COM-rich feature, particularly accretion shocks as a plausible cause for a warm ring. Additionally, molecules such as C18O, H2CO, DCS, H2S, and OCS exhibit distinct behavior compared to CH3OH, indicating a range of physical and chemical conditions within the region. The observed kinematics of H2S and OCS suggest that OCS resides in regions closer to the central protostar than H2S, consistent with previous experimental studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of the light curves and pulsation properties of First Overtone (FO) Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) obtained using observations and predictions from stellar pulsation models. Multiwavelength observational light curves were compiled from the literature (OGLE-IV, Gaia and VMC). We investigate the period-amplitude (PA), period-colour (PC), period-luminosity (PL), and amplitude-colour (AC) relations for FO Cepheids at multiwavelengths. We find that the PA distribution of FO Cepheids in the MCs modelled using a Gaussian Mixture Model shows that the SMC consists of higher amplitude stars than the LMC. We find multiple break-points in the PC/PL/AC relations for FO/FU Cepheids in the optical and near-infrared bands including the one near to P = 2.5 d in the MCs using piecewise regression analysis and F- test statistics. Similarly, for the LMC FO Cepheids, we find a break-point in the PC/PL/AC relations near P = 0.58 d. The slopes of the PC relations for LMC FO Cepheids are found to be shallow for 0.58 < P(d) < 2.5 but steeper for P < 0.58 d and P > 2.5 d. We complemented the observed relations using theoretical models for FO Cepheids with chemical compositions Z = 0.008 and Z = 0.004, appropriate for the LMC and SMC, respectively computed with MESA-RSP. Our results show that the pulsation properties of FO Cepheids in PC/PL/AC relations and colour-magnitude diagram are strongly correlated and their connections can provide stringent constraints for the theoretical pulsation models.

 - **Abstract**
 The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Context. It is crucial to understand the interaction between globular clusters (GCs) and the Oort cloud, as close flybys of such massive objects can significantly disturb the cloud's structure and redirect comets towards the inner Solar System. This increases the risk of impacts on Earth. Studying such events can teach us about the evolution and stability of the Solar System, as well as the effect of external gravitational forces on its dynamics over time. Aims. In our study of the gravitational effects of the flyby of the NGC 7078 or M 15 GC on the Oort cloud, we focus on two types of approximation. First, we investigate the impact on the Sun's orbit during close passages, treating the GC as a point mass. At the second stage, we use a complete N-body system representation of the GC comprising over one million particles. Methods. We carried out a dynamical study of the gravitational interaction between Oort cloud particles and galactic GCs within the time-varying galactic external potential. Initially, the GCs are represented as point masses orbiting the Galaxy alongside the Sun and the Oort cloud system. Results. Our study reveals significant variations in the impact of NGC 7078 on the Oort cloud, depending on whether it is modelled as a point mass or a complete N-body system. The N-body system results in much greater stripping of Oort cloud particles, with over 52% stripped during a close pass, compared to a few percent in the point mass model for a flyby at a large distance (>200 pc) and 36% for a closer 10 pc point mass flyby. The N-body system also causes substantial expansion, with particles spreading over 50 pc from the Sun within 30 Myr after the GC's crossing. This creates a twisted and flattened cloud structure with extended outer tails. These stripped cloud particles (more than 10%) spread across the galaxy, reaching distances of up to 16 kpc from the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of JWST, with its unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution, infrared spectral surveys have revealed a rich inventory of ices, including complex organic molecules (COMs), in young stellar objects (YSOs). However, robust methods to decompose and quantify these absorption features particularly across broad spectral ranges, are still under investigation. We present INDRA (Ice-fitting with NNLS-based Decomposition and Retrieval Algorithm), a fully Python-based tool that performs continuum and silicate removal, global ice fitting using Weighted Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), and estimates column densities and statistical significance. We apply INDRA to NGC 1333 IRAS 2A, a target from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program previously studied using local fitting. We derive optical depths via polynomial continuum subtraction and remove silicate absorption using a synthetic model, isolating ice features for global MIRI fitting. Our results are consistent with previous local fits, confirming simple species and COMs, and expand the inventory by identifying additional absorption features from CO2 and NH4+. We also propose the presence of organic refractories contributing up to 9.6% in the spectral region of 5-8 microns among the various ice components, whose inclusion significantly improves the global spectral fitting. These broad absorption features, extending across 5.5-11 microns, are likely produced by large, complex molecules containing carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (O-H), amine (N-H), and C-H bending modes. Our expanded inventory, now incorporating these organic residues, offers new insights into the chemical evolution of ices in star-forming regions and highlights the importance of global spectral fitting in constraining ice compositions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence governs the fragmentation of molecular clouds and plays a pivotal role in star formation. The persistence of observed cloud turbulence suggests it does not decay significantly within the turnover timescale, implying a recurrent driving mechanism. Although ubiquitous self-gravity is a plausible driver, MHD simulations by \citet{ostriker2001density} demonstrated that self-gravity alone does not modify the global turbulence decay rate. In this study, we demonstrate that the dominant diffuse volume of a cloud dictates its overall decay rate, while individual dense cores can maintain near-zero decay rates. Crucially, this phenomenon is absent in control simulations excluding self-gravity. This discrepancy cannot be attributed to contamination of turbulent velocities by core contraction, as most cores in our simulations remain in a quasi-equilibrium state. Our analysis reveals that the gravitational potential energy released during core formation\textemdash not necessarily driven by self-gravity but also by turbulent compression\textemdash is sufficient to sustain the observed turbulence levels within cores.

 - **Abstract**
 In the interstellar medium (ISM), polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are believed to be an important carbon reservoir, accounting for up to a quarter of all interstellar carbon in our galaxy. This makes the investigation of their potential formation precursors highly relevant in the context of ISM chemistry. This, in turn, includes knowing the abundance of the precursor species. One of the possible precursor molecules for PAHs is the recently detected cyanocyclopentadiene, c-C$_5$H$_5$CN. Given the physical conditions of the dense dark molecular cloud TMC-1 where the cyclic species was detected, it is crucial to consider that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions may not be satisfied. In such case an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance involves taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes, which requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant interstellar species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first potential energy surface (PES) for the interaction of the most stable isomer of cyanocyclopentadiene (1-cyano-1,3-cyclopentadiene) with He atoms is computed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)-F12]. The obtained PES demonstrates a high anisotropy and is characterized by a global potential well of -101.8 cm$^{-1}$. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of 1-cyano-cyclopentadiene induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum mechanical close-coupling method for total energies up to 125 cm$^{-1}$. The resulting rotational state-to-state cross sections are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favoring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.
