 - **Abstract**
 Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black hole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity than high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains mostly flat with metallicity, and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers show intermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact objects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and for merger rate calculations. Yet, the literature offers various (sometimes contradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause for the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that the BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition distributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about one in eight interacting binary systems with sufficient mass to form black holes will lead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities in double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The stable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly diminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the common envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of stellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions exacerbate the latter effect, suggesting BHBH formation may be much less metallicity dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency remains metallicity independent as they form exclusively through the common envelope channel, with natal kicks that are uncorrelated with mass. Forthcoming GW observations will provide valuable constraints on these findings

 - **Abstract**
 We present supernova (SN) 2023ufx, a unique Type IIP SN with the shortest known plateau duration ($t_\mathrm{PT}$ $\sim$47 days), a luminous V-band peak ($M_{V}$ = $-$18.42 $\pm$ 0.08 mag), and a rapid early decline rate ($s1$ = 3.47 $\pm$ 0.09 mag (50 days)$^{-1}$). By comparing observed photometry to a hydrodynamic MESA+STELLA model grid, we constrain the progenitor to be a massive red supergiant with M$_\mathrm{ZAMS}$ $\simeq$19 - 25 M$_{\odot}$. Independent comparisons with nebular spectral models also suggest an initial He-core mass of $\sim$6 M$_{\odot}$, and thus a massive progenitor. For a Type IIP, SN 2023ufx produced an unusually high amount of nickel ($^{56}$Ni) $\sim$0.14 $\pm$ 0.02 M$_{\odot}$, during the explosion. We find that the short plateau duration in SN 2023ufx can be explained with the presence of a small hydrogen envelope (M$_\mathrm{H_\mathrm{env}}$ $\simeq$1.2 M$_{\odot}$), suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. About $\simeq$0.09 M$_{\odot}$ of CSM through mass loss from late-time stellar evolution of the progenitor is needed to fit the early time ($\lesssim$10 days) pseudo-bolometric light curve. Nebular line diagnostics of broad and multi-peak components of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6364, H$\alpha$, and [Ca II] $\lambda \lambda$7291, 7323 suggest that the explosion of SN 2023ufx could be inherently asymmetric, preferentially ejecting material along our line-of-sight.
#### Hubble Space Telescope survey of Magellanic Cloud star clusters. Binaries among the split main sequences of NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly all star clusters younger than ~600 Myr exhibit extended main sequence turn offs and split main sequences (MSs) in their color-magnitude diagrams. Works based on both photometry and spectroscopy have firmly demonstrated that the red MS is composed of fast-rotating stars, whereas blue MS stars are slow rotators. Nevertheless, the mechanism responsible for the formation of stellar populations with varying rotation rates remains a topic of debate. Potential mechanisms proposed for the split MS include binary interactions, early evolution of pre-main sequence stars, and the merging of binary systems, but a general consensus has yet to be reached. These formation scenarios predict different fractions of binaries among blue- and red-MS stars. Therefore, studying the binary populations can provide valuable constraints that may help clarify the origins of the split MSs. We use high-precision photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to study the binaries of three young Magellanic star clusters exhibiting split MS, namely NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164. By analyzing the photometry in the F225W, F275W, F336W, and F814W filters for observed binaries and comparing it to a large sample of simulated binaries, we determine the fractions of binaries within the red and the blue MS. We find that the fractions of binaries among the blue MS are higher than those of red-MS stars by a factor of ~1.5, 4.6, and ~1.9 for NGC 1818, NGC 1850, and NGC 2164, respectively. We discuss these results in the context of the formation scenarios of the split MS.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse the energy spectral density properties of Gravitational waves from Galactic binary populations in the~\text{mHz} band targeted by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission. Our analysis is based on combining BPASS with a Milky Way analogue galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environment (FIRE) simulations and the GWs these populations emit. Our investigation compares different functional forms of gravitational wave (GW) ESDs, namely the single power-law, broken power-law, and single-peak models, revealing disparities within and among Galactic binary populations. We estimate the ESDs for six different Galactic binary populations and the ESD of the total Galactic binary population for LISA. Employing a single power-law model, we predict a total Galactic binary GW signal amplitude $\alpha$ = $2.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} \times 10^{-8}$ and a slope $\beta$ = $-2.64 ^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ and the ESD $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW}$ = $1.1 ^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^{-9}$ at 3~\text{mHz}. For the Galactic WDB binary GW signal $\alpha = 1^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \times 10^{-10}$, $\beta = -1.56 ^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ and $\rm h^2 \Omega_{GW} = 18 ^{+1}_{-1} \times 10^{-12}$. Our analysis underscores the importance of accurate noise parameter estimation and highlights the complexities of modelling realistic observations, prompting future exploration into more flexible models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results from our extensive hard-to-soft X-ray (NuSTAR, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton, Chandra) and meter-to-mm wave radio (GMRT, VLA, NOEMA) monitoring campaign of the very nearby (d $=6.9$ Mpc) Type II SN2023ixf spanning $\approx$ 4--165 d post-explosion. This unprecedented dataset enables inferences on the explosion's circumstellar medium (CSM) density and geometry. Specifically, we find that the luminous X-ray emission is well modeled by thermal free-free radiation from the forward shock with rapidly decreasing photo-electric absorption with time. The radio spectrum is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the same shock, and the NOEMA detection of high-frequency radio emission may indicate a new component consistent with the secondary origin. Similar to the X-rays, the level of free-free absorption affecting the radio spectrum rapidly decreases with time as a consequence of the shock propagation into the dense CSM. While the X-ray and the radio modeling independently support the presence of a dense medium corresponding to an \emph{effective} mass-loss rate $\dot{M} \approx 10^{-4}\, \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at $R = (0.4-14) \times 10^{15}$ (for $v_{\rm w}=\rm 25 \,km\,s^{-1}$), our study points at a complex CSM density structure with asymmetries and clumps. The inferred densities are $\approx$10--100 times those of typical red supergiants, indicating an extreme mass-loss phase of the progenitor in the $\approx$200 years preceding core collapse, which leads to the most X-ray luminous Type II SN and the one with the most delayed emergence of radio emission. These results add to the picture of the complex mass-loss history of massive stars on the verge of collapse and demonstrate the need for panchromatic campaigns to fully map their intricate environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of a jet geometry transition region is an important instrument of assessing the jet ambient medium properties, plasma bulk motion acceleration, parameters of a black hole and location of a jet launching radius. In this work we explore the possibility of a presence of a core shift break, associated with the geometry and jet physical properties transition. We obtain the relations on the core shift offset jump due to a change in a core shift exponent. The condition of a proper frame magnetic field continuity and the core shift break can be used as an instrument to refine the magnetic field estimates upstream the break. This method is applied to the jet in NGC 315. We speculate that the localised in a flow plasma heating either by reconnection or due to particles acceleration at the shock will also lead to a core shift break, but of a different type, than the one observed in NGC 315. We propose to use the multi-frequency core shift measurements to increase the number of sources with a detected jet shape break and to boost the accuracy of assessing the properties of a jet geometry transition region.

 - **Abstract**
 The atomic and molecular compounds of cometary ices serve as valuable knowledge into the chemical and physical properties of the outer solar nebula, where comets are formed. From the cometary atmospheres, the atoms and gas-phase molecules arise mainly in three ways: (i) the outgassing from the nucleus, (ii) the photochemical process, and (iii) the sublimation of icy grains from the nucleus. In this paper, we present the radio and millimeter wavelength observation results of Oort cloud non-periodic comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) band L and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6. We do not detect continuum emissions and an emission line of atomic hydrogen (HI) at rest frequency 1420 MHz from this comet using the GMRT. Based on ALMA observations, we detect the dust continuum emission and rotational emission lines of methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) from comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF). From the dust continuum emission, the activity of dust production (Af$\rho$) of comet ZTF is 2280$\pm$50 cm. Based on LTE spectral modelling, the column density and excitation temperature of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) are (4.50$\pm$0.25)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 70$\pm$3 K. The integrated emission maps show that CH$_{3}$OH was emitted from the coma region of the comet. The production rate of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is (7.32$\pm$0.64)$\times$10$^{26}$ molecules s$^{-1}$. The fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with respect to H$_{2}$O in the coma of the comet is 1.52%. We also compare our derived abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with the existence modelled value, and we see the observed and modelled values are nearly similar. We claim that CH$_{3}$OH is formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of formaldehyde (H$_{2}$CO) on the grain surface of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF).

 - **Abstract**
 The eXTP mission is a major project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), with a large involvement of Europe. Its scientific payload includes four instruments: SFA, PFA, LAD and WFM. They offer an unprecedented simultaneous wide-band Xray timing and polarimetry sensitivity. A large European consortium is contributing to the eXTP study, both for the science and the instrumentation. Europe is expected to provide two of the four instruments: LAD and WFM; the LAD is led by Italy and the WFM by Spain. The WFM for eXTP is based on the design originally proposed for the LOFT ESA M3 mission, that underwent a Phase A feasibility study. It will be a wide field of view X-ray monitor instrument working in the 2-50 keV energy range, achieved with large-area Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs), similar to the ones used for the LAD but with better spatial resolution. The WFM will consist of 3 pairs of coded mask cameras with a total combined field of view (FoV) of 90x180 degrees at zero response and a source localisation accuracy of ~1 arc min. The main goal of the WFM is to provide triggers for the target of opportunity observations of the SFA, PFA and LAD, in order to perform the core science programme, dedicated to the study of matter under extreme conditions of density, gravity and magnetism. In addition, the unprecedented combination of large field of view and imaging capability, down to 2 keV, of the WFM will allow eXTP to make important discoveries of the variable and transient X-ray sky, and provide X-ray coverage of a broad range of astrophysical objects covered under 'observatory science', such as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, gravitational wave electromagnetic counterparts. In this paper we provide an overview of the WFM instrument, explaining its design, configuration, and anticipated performance.
#### Comparison of Bayesian inference methods using the Loreli II database of hydro-radiative simulations of the 21-cm signal

 - **Abstract**
 While the observation of the 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization is an instrumental challenge, the interpretation of a prospective detection is still open to questions regarding the modelling of the signal and the Bayesian inference techniques that bridge the gap between theory and observations. To address some of these questions, we present Loreli II, a database of nearly 10 000 simulations of the 21 cm signal run with the Licorice 3D radiative transfer code. With Loreli II, we explore a 5-dimensional astrophysical parameter space where star formation, X-ray emissions, and UV emissions are varied. We then use this database to train neural networks and perform Bayesian inference on 21 cm power spectra affected by thermal noise at the level of 100 hours of observation with the Square Kilometer Array. We study and compare three inference techniques : an emulator of the power spectrum, a Neural Density Estimator that fits the implicit likelihood of the model, and a Bayesian Neural Network that directly fits the posterior distribution. We measure the performances of each method by comparing them on a statistically representative set of inferences, notably using the principles of Simulation-Based Calibration. We report errors on the 1-D marginalized posteriors (biases and over/under confidence) below $15 \%$ of the standard deviation for the emulator and below $25 \%$ for the other methods. We conclude that at our noise level and our sampling density of the parameter space, an explicit Gaussian likelihood is sufficient. This may not be the case at lower noise level or if a denser sampling is used to reach higher accuracy. We then apply the emulator method to recent HERA upper limits and report weak constraints on the X-ray emissivity parameter of our model.

 - **Abstract**
 Evolved cool stars have three distinct evolutionary status: shell Hydrogen-burning (RGB), core Helium and shell Hydrogen burning (RC), and double shell burning (AGB). Asteroseismology can distinguish between the RC and the other status, but distinguishing RGB and AGB has been difficult seismically and spectroscopically. The precise boundaries of different status in the HR diagram have also been difficult to establish. In this article, we present a comprehensive catalog of asteroseismic evolutionary status, RGB and RC, for evolved red giants in the Kepler field. We carefully examine boundary cases to define the lower edge of the RC phase in radius and surface gravity. We also test different published asteroseisemic methods claiming to distinguish AGB and RGB stars against a sample where AGB candidates were selected using a spectrocopic identification method. We used six different seismic techniques to distinguish RC and RGB stars, and tested two proposed methods for distinguishing AGB and RGB stars. These status were compared with those inferred from spectroscopy. We present consensus evolutionary status for 18,784 stars out of the 30,337 red giants present in the Kepler data, including 11,516 stars with APOGEE spectra available. The agreement between seismic and spectroscopic classification is excellent for distinguishing RC stars, agreeing at the 94% level. Most disagreements can be traced to uncertainties in spectroscopic parameters, but some are caused by blends with background stars. We find a sharp lower boundary in surface gravity at log(g) = 2.99+/-0.01 for the RC and discuss the implications. We demonstrate that asteroseismic tools for distinguishing AGB and RGB stars are consistent with spectroscopic evolutionary status at near the RC but that the agreement between the different methods decreases rapidly as the star evolves.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first broadband near- to mid-infrared (3-12 microns) transmission spectrum of the highly-irradiated (T_eq = 981 K) M dwarf rocky planet L 168-9 b (TOI-134 b) observed with the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments aboard JWST. We measure the near-infrared transit depths to a combined median precision of 20 ppm across the three visits in 54 spectroscopic channels with uniform widths of 60 pixels (~0.2 microns wide; R~100), and the mid-infrared transit depths to 61 ppm median precision in 48 wavelength bins (~0.15 microns wide; R~50). We compare the transmission spectrum of L 168-9 b to a grid of 1D thermochemical equilibrium forward models, and rule out atmospheric metallicities of less than 100x solar (mean molecular weights <4 g mol$^{-1}$) to 3-sigma confidence assuming high surface pressure (>1 bar), cloudless atmospheres. Based on photoevaporation models for L 168-9 b with initial atmospheric mass fractions ranging from 2-100%, we find that this planet could not have retained a primordial H/He atmosphere beyond the first 200 Myr of its lifetime. Follow-up MIRI eclipse observations at 15 microns could make it possible to confidently identify a CO2-dominated atmosphere on this planet if one exists.
