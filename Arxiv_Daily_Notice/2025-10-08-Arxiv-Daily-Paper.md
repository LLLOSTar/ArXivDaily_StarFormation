#### QML-FAST - A Fast Code for low-$\ell$ Tomographic Maximum Likelihood Power Spectrum Estimation

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel implementation for the quadratic maximum likelihood (QML) power spectrum estimator for multiple correlated scalar fields on the sphere. Our estimator supports arbitrary binning in redshift and multipoles $\ell$ and includes cross-correlations of redshift bins. It implements a fully optimal analysis with a pixel-wise covariance model. We implement a number of optimizations which make the estimator and associated covariance matrix computationally tractable for a low-$\ell$ analysis, suitable for example for kSZ velocity reconstruction or primordial non-Gaussianity from scale-dependent bias analyses. We validate our estimator extensively on simulations and compare its features and precision with the common pseudo-$C_\ell$ method, showing significant gains at large scales. We make our code publicly available. In a companion paper, we apply the estimator to kSZ velocity reconstruction using data from ACT and DESI Legacy Survey and construct full set of QML estimators on 40 correlated fields up to $N_{\text{side}}= 32$ in timescale of an hour on a single 24-core CPU requiring $<256\ \mathrm{Gb}$ RAM, demonstrating the performance of the code.

 - **Abstract**
 The dominant sources of photoionizing radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) incident on the exterior of the local interstellar clouds include two nearby early B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), three hot dwarfs, and the local hot bubble (LHB). Line emission (170-912A) from highly ionized metals (Fe, Ne, Mg) in million-degree LHB plasma may be responsible for the elevated ionization fractions of helium ($n_{\rm HeII}/n_{\rm He} \approx 0.4$) compared to hydrogen ($n_{\rm HII} / n_{\rm H} \approx 0.2$) in the local clouds. We update the stellar parameters and ionizing flux for $\beta$ CMa, after correcting the EUV spectra for intervening HI column density, $N_{\rm HI} = 1.9\pm0.1\times10^{18}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, and its hotter effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff} \approx 25,000$K vs. 21,000K for $\epsilon$ CMa. These two stars produce a combined H-ionizing photon flux $\Phi_{\rm H} \approx 6800\pm1400$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the external surface of the local clouds. The hot bubble could produce comparable fluxes, $\Phi_{\rm H} =$ 2000-9000 cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, depending on the amount of metal depletion into dust grains that survive sputtering. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun $4.4\pm0.1$ Myr ago, with 100-200 times higher local ionizing fluxes. At that time, the local clouds were likely farther from the Sun, owing to their transverse motion. Over the last few Myr, EUV radiation from these two stars left a wake of highly ionized gas in a hot, low-density cavity produced by past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association and connected with the LHB.
#### Water solubility in silicate melts: The effects of melt composition under reducing conditions and implications for nebular ingassing on rocky planets

 - **Abstract**
 Rocky planet atmospheres form and evolve through interactions between the planet's surface and interior. If a growing rocky planet acquires enough mass prior to the dissipation of the nebular gas disk, it can gravitationally capture a `primary' atmosphere dominated by H2. At the same time, these young, rocky bodies are likely to have partial or global magma oceans as a result of the heat from accretion, core formation and radioactive decay of short-lived major element isotopes. During this magma ocean stage, the dissolution of volatile, life-essential elements, such as hydrogen in the form of water or H2, into the magma is critical in determining the extent to which a rocky planet can maintain these elements over time. However, our ability to quantify the amount of hydrogen dissolved in the magma oceans of rocky planets is limited by the lack of experimental constraints on H-bearing species' solubilities at relevant pressure and temperature conditions, including those expected for the early Earth. Here we experimentally determine the solubility of water in silicate melts of various compositions in the Ca-Mg-Al-Si-Fe-O system at a total pressure of 1 bar and temperatures from 1673-1823 K, synthesized in a H2-CO2 gas-mixing furnace. We use Bayesian parameter estimation to derive a robust water solubility law that includes the effects of melt composition and temperature. Using this solubility law, we estimate that ~100 ppm of hydrogen can dissolve into a 1 MEarth planet with a surface pressure of ~300 bars set by accretion of solar-like nebular gas. For rocky planets in general, ingassing of a primary atmosphere may be an important source and initial storage mechanism for hydrogen-bearing species in a planet's interior, provided it grew to a sufficient mass within the lifetime of the solar nebula.
#### Gamma-ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.
#### Observation and modeling of a geo-effective event observed on 2011 May 28 from the solar surface to 1au

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05334

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present a comprehensive observational and modeling study of a geo-effective event with D_ST index of -80 nT observed on 2011 May 28 when a coronal hole was bordering an active region. We analyze HMI and EUV images and found that this event involved two filament eruptions ~8 hours apart from two different active region closed to each other. We produce 3D magnetic field configurations for the active regions that are consistent with the observations and employ numerical models to track the CME/ICME propagation up to 1\,au. From our, magnetic models we found that the nearby coronal hole reduced the stability threshold of the flux ropes, with axial flux values approximately three times lower than in comparable cases without coronal holes. A derivative analysis applied to STEREO coronagraph and OMNI database in situ data revealed no evidence of CME-CME interaction during the early stages of their evolution and identified distinct signatures of two CMEs, along with the interacting flow associated with the nearby coronal hole at 1 au. Moreover, we used hydrodynamic simulations constrained by remote sensing and in situ data to track the different structures in the solar wind. We found a good agreement between data and the models. Additionally, we found that the presence of the coronal hole may have suppressed interactions between CMEs, with the transients subsequently propagating along the solar wind streams emerging from the coronal hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We present detailed analysis of an active region coronal jet accompanying a minifilament eruption that is fully captured and well-resolved in high spatial resolution 174A coronal images from Solar Orbiters Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI). The active region jet is simultaneously observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). An erupting minifilament is rooted at the edge of an active region where mixed-polarity magnetic flux is present. Minority-polarity positive flux merges and cancels with the active regions dominant negative flux at an average rate of 1019 Mx/hr, building a minifilament-holding flux rope and triggering its eruption. The eruption shows a slow rise followed by a fast rise, akin to large-scale filament eruptions. EUI images and Mg II k spectra, displaying simultaneously blueshifts and redshifts at the opposite edges of the spire, indicate counterclockwise untwisting of the jet spire. This jet is the clearest, most comprehensively observed active-region jet with this instrument set, displaying striking similarities with quiet Sun and coronal hole jets. Its magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energies suggest a significant contribution to local coronal heating. We conclude that magnetic flux cancelation builds a minifilament-carrying twisted flux rope and also eventually triggers the flux ropes eruption that makes the coronal jet, in line with our recent results on the buildup and explosion of solar coronal jets in quiet Sun and coronal holes. That is, this active region jet clearly works the same way as the vast majority of quiet Sun and coronal hole jets.
#### Monitoring of 3C 286 with ALMA, IRAM, and SMA from 2006 to 2025: Stability, Synchrotron Ages, and Frequency-Dependent Polarization Attributed to Core-Shift

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of multi-frequency monitoring of the radio quasar 3C 286, conducted using three instruments: ALMA at 91.5, 103.5, 233.0, and 343.4 GHz, the IRAM 30-m Telescope at 86 and 229 GHz, and SMA at 225 GHz. The IRAM measurements from 2006 to 2024 show that the total flux of 3C 286 is stable within measurement uncertainties, indicating long-term stability up to 229 GHz, when applying a fixed Kelvin-to-Jansky conversion factor throughout its dataset. ALMA data from 2018 to 2024 exhibit a decrease in flux, which up to 4% could be attributed to an apparent increase in the absolute brightness of Uranus, the primary flux calibrator for ALMA with the ESA4 model. Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic total flux of 3C 286 has remained stable up to 229 GHz over the monitoring period. The polarization properties of 3C 286 are stable across all observing frequencies. The electric vector position angle (EVPA) gradually rotates as a function of wavelength squared, which is well described by a single power-law over the full frequency range. We therefore propose using the theoretical EVPA values from this model curve for absolute EVPA calibration between 5 and 343.4 GHz. The Faraday rotation measure increases as a function of frequency up to (3.2+/-1.5)x10^4 rad m^-2, following RM proportional to nu^alpha with alpha = 2.05+/-0.06. This trend is consistent with the core-shift effect expected in a conical jet.

 - **Abstract**
 The luminosity distance-redshift ($D_{\rm L}$--$z$) relation derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) yields evidence for a nonzero cosmological constant. SNe Ia analyses typically fit to the functional form $D_{\rm L}(z)$ derived theoretically from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Yet, the metric in the epoch relevant to SNe Ia measurements deviates slightly from FLRW due to gravitational clumping of mass into large-scale structures like filaments and voids, whose sizes span many orders of magnitude. The small deviation is modeled typically by scalar perturbations to the FLRW metric. Each line of sight to a SNe Ia passes through a random sequence of structures, so $D_{\rm L}$ differs stochastically from one line of sight to the next. Here, we calculate the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion in an exact Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Swiss-cheese universe with a power-law hole size distribution, as a function of the lower cut-off $R_{\rm min}$ and logarithmic slope $\gamma$. We find that the standard deviation of $D_{\rm L}$ scales as $\sigma_{D_{\rm L}} \propto z^{2.25\pm0.01} (R_{\rm min}/24\pm1\,{\rm Mpc})^{(0.157\pm0.003)\left[\gamma - (1.16\pm0.02)\right]}$ for redshifts in the range $0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.1$. The scaling shows that the $D_{\rm L}$ dispersion is dominated by a few large voids rather than the many small voids.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive long-term multi-wavelength study of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 3822, based on 17 years (2008 to 2025) of X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical this http URL dataset includes observations from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, the Very Large Telescope, and the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our multiwavelength light curve analysis reveals flux variations across X-ray to optical/UV bands, with an increased variability amplitude at shorter wavelengths. X-ray spectral analysis indicates the presence of intrinsic absorption during the 2016 and 2022 observations; however, this absorption disappeared before and after these epochs. The presence and absence of the absorber are attributed to clouds moving in and out of the line of sight. During the long-term monitoring period, the bolometric luminosity of the source varies between ($1.32-17)\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals changing-look (CL) behaviour in NGC~3822, characterized by the appearance and disappearance of broad emission lines (BELs). These CL transitions are associated with changes in the Eddington ratio rather than changes in the obscuration. The BELs appear only when the Eddington ratio is relatively high ($\sim 3.8\times10^{-3}$) and disappear when it drops to a lower value ($\sim 0.9\times10^{-3}$).

 - **Abstract**
 Late-stage infall onto protoplanetary disks can produce large scale spiral arms. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations to study the kinematic perturbations induced in disks by infalling material. We found that deviations from Keplerian rotation are predominantly in the radial and vertical velocity components, spatially correlated with spiral arms in the gas surface density. The infall produces observable wiggles in the channel maps, analogous to those produce by the gravitational instability (GI), along with large-scale arcs and filaments. GI induced spiral arms produce radial velocity perturbations that point towards the center of the spiral arm owing to their higher self-gravity. We found a similar signature from infall-induced spiral arms, despite not including self-gravity in our simulation. Our study suggests that recent evidence of GI in the kinematics of the disk around AB Aur may instead be due to the observed infall, without the need for invoking GI.
#### MEGATRON: the impact of non-equilibrium effects and local radiation fields on the circumgalactic medium at cosmic noon

 - **Abstract**
 We present three cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic zoom simulations of the progenitor of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the MEGATRON suite. The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\approx 10^4\,M_\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.
#### Radiative-Corrected Higgs Inflation in Light of the Latest ACT Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), particularly when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, have reported a scalar spectral index $n_s$ slightly higher than that inferred by {\it Planck}~2018, suggesting a mild tension with the predictions of standard inflationary attractor models. In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r < 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} < \lambda/\xi^{2} < 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.
#### Exploring Complexity Measures for Analysis of Solar Wind Structures and Streams

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we use statistical complexity and information theory metrics to study structure within solar wind time series. We explore this using entropy-complexity and information planes, where the measure for entropy is formed using either permutation entropy or the degree distribution of a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). The entropy is then compared to the Jensen complexity (Jensen-Shannon complexity plane) and Fisher information measure (Fisher-Shannon information plane), formed both from permutations and the HVG approach. Additionally we characterise the solar wind time series by studying the properties of the HVG degree distribution. Four types of solar wind intervals have been analysed, namely fast streams, slow streams, magnetic clouds and sheath regions, all of which have distinct origins and interplanetary characteristics. Our results show that, overall, different metrics give similar results but Fisher-Shannon, which gives a more local measure of complexity, leads to a larger spread of values in the entropy-complexity plane. Magnetic cloud intervals stood out in all approaches, in particular when analysing the magnetic field magnitude. Differences between solar wind types (except for magnetic clouds) were typically more distinct for larger time lags, suggesting universality in fluctuations for small scales. The fluctuations within the solar wind time series were generally found to be stochastic, in agreement with previous studies. The use of information theory tools in the analysis of solar wind time series can help to identify structures and provide insight into their origin and formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones," which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to >100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma Dor stars are ideal targets for studies of the innermost dynamical properties of stars, due to their rich frequency spectrum of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope. Recent studies found that these modes could couple at the core-to-envelope interface with pure inertial modes in their sub-inertial regime, forming the so-called inertial dip in the period-spacing pattern of these stars. The inertial dip, as formed by core modes, stands out as a unique probe of core properties. We aim in this work to explore the effect of core magnetism on its structure, property of key relevance in modern stellar physics. We describe the outlines of our model and the geometry of the considered field. We give the coupling equation and the variation of the dip shape and location with increasing magnetic contrast between the core and the envelope. We compare our findings to the ones obtained in a hydrodynamical, differentially-rotating case. We show hints at potentially lifting the degeneracy between the signatures of core-to-envelope differential rotation and core magnetic fields. Together, these two cases can be considered as an exploration of different magnetic regimes potentially reached in the core of gamma Dor stars.
#### The influence of rotation and metallicity on the explodability of massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 During the late stages of massive stellar evolution, failed supernovae (FSN) may form through core-collapse processes. The traditional evaluation criterion $\xi_{2.5}$ $=$ 0.45, primarily established using non-rotating progenitor models, suffers from significant inaccuracies when applied to rotating pre-supernova systems. The effects of metallicity and rotation on the explodability landscapes of massive stars lack robust quantification. We aim to investigate how rotation and metallicity influence the explodability of massive stars. We investigate how rotation and metallicity affect stellar explodability using MESA simulations with initial rotational velocities of $0$, $300$, and $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at three metallicities ($Z_{\odot}$, $1/10,Z_{\odot}$, $1/50,Z_{\odot}$). Core-collapse phases are simulated with GR1D to determine critical heating efficiencies. Our results yield revised $\xi_{2.5}$ criteria: 0.45 for non-rotating models; 0.48 for $300~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$; 0.47 for $600~\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$ at solar metallicity; and 0.59 for low-metallicity models. Chemically homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating low-metallicity stars significantly raises the compactness limit for successful explosions and narrows the zero-age main sequence mass range for failed supernovae. Rotation substantially affects the explodability of low-metallicity massive stars, underscoring the importance of incorporating rotational effects in models of core-collapse supernova progenitors.
