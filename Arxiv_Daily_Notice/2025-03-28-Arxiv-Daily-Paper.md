 - **Abstract**
 Blue supergiants (BSGs) mediate between the main sequence and the late stages of massive stars, which makes them valuable for assessing the physics that drives the stars across the diverse evolutionary channels. By exploring correlations between the parameters of BSGs and their variability properties, we aim to improve the constraints on the models of the evolved star structure and on the physics of the post-main-sequence evolution. We conducted a variability study of 41 BSGs with known spectroscopic parameters in the Galaxy using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We described the time domain of the stars by means of three statistical measures and extracted frequencies via iterative pre-whitening. Alongside, we investigated the stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability, which manifests itself in all amplitude spectra. We report a positive correlation between the amplitude of variability and the stellar luminosity. For log(L/L$_{\odot}\lesssim 5$), stars display frequencies that match the rotational one, suggesting that variability is driven by surface spots and/or features embedded in the wind. For log(L/L$_{\odot}\gtrsim 5$), variables of the $\alpha$ Cyg class manifest themselves with their diverse and/or time-variant properties. Moreover, we report a positive correlation between the SLF variability amplitude and $T_{\rm eff}$, indicating an influential role that the stellar age plays on the emergence of the background signal beyond the main sequence. Positive, though weak, correlation is observed between the intrinsic brightness and the SLF variability amplitude, similar to the findings in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which suggests an in common excitation mechanism that depends only mildly on metallicity. Exceptionally, the $\alpha$ Cyg variables display a suppressed SLF variability that prompts to the interior changes that the evolving stars undergo.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia recently revealed a two-armed spiral pattern in the vertical phase-space distribution of the inner Galactic disk (guiding radius $R_\textrm{g} \sim 6.2$ kpc), indicating that some non-adiabatic perturbation symmetric about the mid-plane is driving the inner disk out of equilibrium. The non-axisymmetric structures in the disk (e.g., the bar or spiral arms) have been suspected to be the major source for such a perturbation. However, both the lifetime and the period of these internal perturbations are typically longer than the period at which stars oscillate vertically, implying that the perturbation is generally adiabatic. This issue is particularly pronounced in the inner Galaxy, where the vertical oscillation period is shorter and therefore adiabatically shielded more than the outer disk. We show that two-armed phase spirals can naturally form in the inner disk if there is a vertical resonance that breaks the adiabaticity; otherwise, their formation requires a perturber with an unrealistically short lifetime. We predict analytically and confirm with simulations that a steadily rotating (non-winding) two-armed phase spiral forms near the resonance when stars are subject to both periodic perturbations (e.g., by spiral arms) and stochastic perturbations (e.g., by giant molecular clouds). Due to the presence of multiple resonances, the vertical phase-space exhibits several local phase spirals that rotate steadily at distinct frequencies, together forming a global phase spiral that evolves over time. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to earlier predictions, the formation of the two-armed phase spiral does not require transient perturbations with lifetimes shorter than the vertical oscillation period.

 - **Abstract**
 Almost all the physics of star formation critically depends on the number density of the molecular gas. However, the methods to estimate this key property often rely on uncertain assumptions about geometry, depend on overly simplistic uniform models, or require time-expensive observations to constrain the gas temperature as well. An easy-to-use method to derive n(H2) that is valid under realistic conditions is absent, causing an asymmetry in how accurately this parameter is estimated, and how often dedicated tracers are used, compared to the gas temperature. We propose and calibrate a versatile tool based on CH3OH lines that greatly simplifies the inference of the number density. CH3OH is abundant in both cold and hot gas, and thus it can be applied to a wide variety of scales. Moreover, this tool does not need to be tailored to the specific source properties (e.g. distance, temperature, and mass). We perform RT calculations to investigate the robustness of the line ratios as density probes, also in the presence of density and temperature gradients. We find that the ratios of the (2_K-1_K) band transitions constrain the average n(H2) along the LOS within a factor of 2-3 in the range 5 x 10^4 - 3 x 10^7 cm^-3. The range can be extended down to a few times 10^3 cm^-3, when also using line ratios from the (5_K-4_K) and/or (7_K-6_K) bands. We provide practical analytic formulas and a numerical method for deriving n(H2) and its uncertainty from the line ratios. Thanks to our calibration and analytical recipes, we make the estimate of n(H2) much simpler, with an effort comparable or inferior to deriving Tex, contributing to offsetting the disparity between these two fundamental parameters of the molecular gas. Applying our method to a sub-sample of sources from the ATLASGAL TOP100 we show that the material in the clumps is being compressed, accelerating in the latest stages.
#### Galaxy and Halo Root Systems: Fingerprints of Mass Assembly

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss what we call halo or galaxy root systems, collections of particle pathlines that show the infall of matter from the initial uniform distribution into a collapsed structure. The matter clumps as it falls in, producing filamentary density enhancements analogous to tree roots and branches, blood vessels, or even human transportation infrastructure in cities and regions. This relates to the larger-scale cosmic web, but is defined locally about one of its nodes; a physical, geometric version of a merger tree. We find dark-matter-halo root systems on average to exhibit more roots and root branches for the largest cluster haloes than in small haloes. This may relate to the `cosmic-web detachment' mechanism that likely contributes to star-formation quenching in galaxy groups and clusters. We also find that high spin manifests in these root systems as curvier roots.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The study of blue straggler stars (BSS) provides insight into the mechanisms of stellar mass exchange during binary stellar evolution and the complex gravitational interactions within dense stellar systems. In combination, they enhance our understanding of the possible life cycles of stars and the evolutionary pathways of star clusters. Aim. We study the populations of BSSs in 41 globular clusters (GCs) and 42 open clusters (OCs) adopting photometry, proper motion, and parallax from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), confirming their cluster membership. We find a total of 4399 BSSs: all GCs show the presence of BSSs (3965 or ~90% of the sample), whereas only 42 out of 129 studied OCs show the presence of BSSs (434 or ~10% of the sample). Clusters younger than ~500 Myr do not host any BSSs. Methods. We derive their astrophysical parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and mass based on color-temperature relations, isochrone models and Gaia DR3 spectroscopy (if available). We find values for $T_{\rm eff}=(6800 \pm 585) \ {\rm K}$ and $(7570 \pm 1400) \ {\rm K}$; and an average mass of $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.02 \pm 0.1) \ {M_\odot}$ and $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.75 \pm 0.45) \ {M_\odot}$ for GCs and OCs, respectively. We finally compute the difference of the BSS mass and the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) mass of its respective cluster, normalized by the MSTO mass, for every identified BSS. Results. Based on this parameter and BSSs ages derived from isochrone models, we find: i) GC BSSs that are most likely to be formed through collisions show a "boost" for ages ~ 1-2 Gyr, in agreement with ages for core-collapse events in GCs reported in previous studies; ii) a double sequence for GC BSSs that could indicate the hint of a pre/post-merger or close-binary scenario.
#### ALMA 2D Super-resolution Imaging Survey of Ophiuchus Class I/Flat Spectrum/II Disks -- I: Discovery of New Disk Substructures

 - **Abstract**
 This study focuses on Class I, Flat Spectrum (FS), and Class II disks in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, a nearby active star-forming region with numerous young stellar objects (YSOs), to unveil signs of substructure formation in these disks. We employ two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling (SpM) for ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data, achieving images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au (0".02-0".2) for 78 dust disks, all of which are spatially resolved. In our sample, we confirm that approximately 30-40% of the disks exhibit substructures, and we identify new substructures in 15 disks (4 Class I, 7 Class FS, and 4 Class II objects). Compared to the eDisk sample in terms of bolometric temperature, Tbol, our targets are in a relatively later accretion phase. By combining our targets with the eDisk sample, we confirm that substructure detection in available data is restricted to objects where Tbol exceeds 200-300 K and the dust disk radius, Rdust, is larger than ~30 au. Moreover, we find that the distribution of inclination angles for Class II disks has a deficit of high values and is not consistent with being random. Analyzing molecular line emission data around these objects will be crucial to constrain disk evolutionary stages further and understand when and how substructures form.

 - **Abstract**
 This research paper aims to compare different methods for calculating the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (\textit{LMC}). The distance, $d_{LMC}$, is determined using stellar parallax, variable stars (RR Lyrae and Classical Cepheids), redshift, and celestial mechanics, from which the systematic and standard errors are calculated. After analyzing each method, the final distance is obtained as $d_{LMC} = 50.4802 \pm 0.0638_{\text{std}}$ Kpc, differing by $+0.5102$ Kpc from the currently most accepted value of $d_{LMC} = 49.97$ Kpc (Pietrzyński, 2014). In this paper, the value of $d_{LMC}$ was derived by combining the distances determined from RR Lyrae and Classical Cepheid variable stars, celestial mechanics and parallax.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs at the L-T transition likely experience an inhomogeneous clearing of the clouds in their atmospheres. The resulting surface of thin and thick cloudy patches has been put forward to explain the observed variability, J-band brightening, and re-emergence of FeH absorption. We study the closest brown dwarf binary, Luhman 16A and B, in an effort to constrain their chemical and cloud compositions. As this binary consists of an L7.5 and T0.5 component, we gain insight into the atmospheric properties at the L-T transition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we observed Luhman 16AB at high spectral resolution in the J-band ($1.1-1.4\ \mathrm{\mu m}$) using CRIRES$^+$. To analyse the spectra, we employ an atmospheric retrieval framework, coupling the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS with the MultiNest sampling algorithm. For both objects, we report detections of H$_2$O, K, Na, FeH, and, for the first time in the J-band, hydrogen-fluoride (HF). The K doublet at $1250\ \mathrm{nm}$ shows asymmetric absorption in the blue line wings, which are reproduced via pressure- and temperature-dependent shifts of the line cores. We find evidence for clouds in both spectra and we place constraints on an FeH-depletion in the Luhman 16A photosphere. The inferred over-abundance of FeH for Luhman 16B opposes its predicted rainout into iron clouds. A two-column model, which emulates the patchy surface expected at the L-T transition, is weakly preferred ($\sim 1.8\sigma$) for component B but disfavoured for A ($\sim 5.5\sigma$). The results suggest a uniform surface on Luhman 16A, which is in good agreement with the reduced variability observed for this L-type component. While the presented evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about any inhomogeneity on Luhman 16B, future observations covering a broader wavelength range could help to test the cloud-clearing hypothesis.
#### Study of the origin of the azimuthal variation of synchrotron X-ray spectrum from SNR RX J0852.0-4622

 - **Abstract**
 We report the azimuthal distribution of the X-ray energy spectrum of non-thermal dominant supernova remnant RX J0852.0$-$4622. The X-rays from the shock region observed by the X-ray astronomy satellite Suzaku/XIS in the energy range of 2-8 keV are well described by the absorbed power-law model and can be parameterized with flux and photon index. The X-ray flux and photon index are bimodally distributed in relation to the azimuthal angle. To understand its origin, we examined three possible causes: azimuthal variation by (1) the galactic magnetic field, (2) cloud density, and (3) shock velocity. From the polarization observations of stars near the SNR, we find that the Galactic magnetic field around the SNR is not aligned. This result leads us to conclude that the azimuthal variation of the X-ray spectrum is most likely not caused by the Galactic magnetic field. The X-ray fluxes are positively correlated with the cloud density with a significance of $\sim 5\sigma$, and the azimuthal distributions of these physical quantities are particularly pronounced in the northern part of the SNR. In addition, the X-ray fluxes on the southern part of the SNR are positively correlated with the shock velocity. This phenomenon can be qualitatively explained by the increase in roll-off energy due to the amplification of the magnetic field by (A) the interaction between the shock and dense clouds in the north and (B) the fast shock velocity in the south of the SNR. Since the shock velocity is likely related to the cloud density interacting with the shock, we conclude that the azimuthal variation of cloud density most likely causes the azimuthal variations of the X-ray flux and photon index.

 - **Abstract**
 CONTEXT: Dense cores are thought to be isolated from the surrounding cloud. However, observations of streamers and subsonic material outside core boundaries challenges this idea. AIMS: In this study, we aim to probe the extended subsonic region observed around the pre-stellar core H-MM1 in L1688 using multi-component kinematical analysis of very high-sensitivity NH3 data. METHODS: We used observations of NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) using GBT. We then fitted up to two components towards the core and its surrounding molecular cloud. RESULTS: We detect an extended region of subsonic turbulence in addition to the ambient cloud, which show supersonic turbulence. This extended subsonic region is approximately 12 times the size of and more than two times as massive as the previously detected subsonic material. The subsonic region is further split into two well-separated, velocity-coherent components, one of which is kinematically and spatially connected to the dense core. The two subsonic components are red- and blue-shifted with respected to the cloud component. We also detect a flow of material onto the dense core from the extended subsonic region via a streamer of length ~0.15 pc (~30000 au). CONCLUSIONS: We find that the extended subsonic component kinematically associated with the dense core contains 27% more mass than the core. This material could be further accreted by the core. The other subsonic component contains a mass similar to that of the core mass, and could be tracing material in the early stage of core formation. The H-MM1 streamer is kinematically similar to the ones observed towards protostellar systems, but is the first instance of such an accretion feature onto a core in its pre-stellar phase. This accretion of chemically fresh material by the pre-stellar core challenges our current understanding of a core evolving with a mass unchanged since the time of its formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars are one of the possible final stages in the evolution of massive stars. If a supernova explosion is anisotropic, it can give the pulsar a powerful kick, propelling it to supersonic speeds. The resulting pulsar wind nebula is significantly reshaped by its interaction with the surrounding medium as the pulsar moves through it. First, the pulsar crosses the supernova remnant, followed by the different layers of circumstellar medium formed during different stages of the progenitor star s evolution. We aim to investigate how the evolutionary history of massive stars shapes the bow shock nebulae of runaway kicked pulsars, and how these influences in turn affect the dynamics and non-thermal radio emission of the entire pulsar remnant. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code to model the pulsar wind nebula generated by a runaway pulsar in the supernova remnant of a red supergiant progenitor, and derive its non-thermal radio emission. The supernova remnant and the pre-supernova circumstellar medium of the progenitor strongly confine and reshape the pulsar wind nebula of the runaway pulsar, bending its two side jets inwards and giving the nebula an arched shape for an observer perpendicular to the jets and the propagation direction, as observed around PSR J1509 5850 and Gemina. We perform the first classical 3D model of a pulsar moving inward through its supernova ejecta and circumstellar medium, inducing a bending of its polar jet that turns into characteristic radio synchrotron signature. The circumstellar medium of young runaway pulsars has a significant influence on the morphology and emission of pulsar wind nebulae, whose comprehension requires a detailed understanding of the evolutionary history of the progenitor star.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments are ubiquitous in astronomical data sets. Be it in particle simulations or observations, filaments are always tracers of a perturbation in the equilibrium of the studied system and hold essential information on its history and future evolution. However, the recovery of such structures is often complicated by the presence of a large amount of background and transverse noise in the observation space. While the former is generally detrimental to the analysis, the latter can be attributed to measurement errors and it can hold essential information about the structure. To further complicate the scenario, 1D manifolds (filaments) are generally non-linear and their geometry difficult to extract and model. In order to study hidden manifolds within the dataset, particular care has to be devoted to background noise removal and transverse noise modelling, while still maintaining accuracy in the recovery of their geometrical structure. We propose 1-DREAM: a toolbox composed of five main Machine Learning methodologies whose aim is to facilitate manifold extraction in such cases. Each methodology has been designed to address issues when dealing with complicated low-dimensional structures convoluted with noise and it has been extensively tested in previously published works. In this work all methodologies are presented in detail, joint within a cohesive framework and demonstrated for three interesting astronomical cases: a simulated jellyfish galaxy, a filament extracted from a simulated cosmic web and the stellar stream of Omega-Centauri as observed with the GAIA DR2. Two newly developed visualization techniques are also proposed, that take full advantage of the results obtained with 1-DREAM. The code is made publicly available to benefit the community. The controlled experiments on a purposefully built data set prove the accuracy of the pipeline in recovering the hidden structures.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a high resolution zoom-in simulation of star cluster assembly including the merger of two sub-clusters with initial conditions taken from previous large scale giant molecular cloud (GMC) simulations. We couple hydrodynamics to N-body dynamics to simulate the individual stars themselves, and the gas-rich environment in which they evolve. We include prescriptions for star formation and stellar feedback and compare directly to previous simulations of the same region without these prescriptions to determine their role in shaping the dynamics inherited from the cluster assembly process. The stellar mass of the cluster grows through star formation within the cluster and accretion of new stars and star forming gas from a nearby filament. This growth results in an enhancement in the cluster's rotation and anisotropic expansion compared to simulations without star formation. We also analyze the internal kinematics of the cluster once it has lost most of its gas and find that the rotational velocity and the velocity anisotropy profiles are qualitatively similar to those expected of clusters that have undergone violent relaxation. As well, rotation and anisotropic expansion are still present by the time of gas removal. This implies that evolution within the GMC was unable to completely erase the kinematics inherited by the merger.
#### Expectation for the MeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Pair-Instability Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are predicted thermonuclear explosions of massive stars with helium core masses exceeding $\sim 65M_\odot$ and synthesize substantial amounts of radioactive $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$ ($M(\mathrm{^{56}Ni})\sim60M_\odot$ in extreme cases). To investigate their observational signatures, we developed a 1D Monte Carlo radiation transport code and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the decay chain $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\to\mathrm{^{56}Co}\to\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find that key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in the $130M_\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by next-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the $100M_\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the template for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical predictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within 300 Mpc to be approximately 0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but also emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations over the decade.
