 - **Abstract**
 We study Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (DSB) models in the context of dynamical astrophysical systems, specifically tackling observational inverse prediction tasks within Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) for star formation. We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.

 - **Abstract**
 SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is a candidate hyper-runaway star, first identified from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which exhibits oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines redshifted by several $100\,$km/s, leading to the suggestion it was ejected from a thermonuclear supernova. We have acquired GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631 establishing a warm ($T_\mathrm{eff}=15680\pm250\,$K) carbon+oxygen dominated atmosphere, that is also abundant in the intermediate mass elements silicon, sulphur, and calcium. We interpret SDSSJ1637+3631 as the donor to an accreting white dwarf that exploded in a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type Ia supernova, where the current composition is consistent with a CO white dwarf core, enriched with intermediate mass elements from deposited supernova ejecta. While SDSSJ1637+3631 has a low-precision Gaia parallax, our spectroscopic surface gravity ($\log g=6.3\pm0.3\,$dex) helps constrain its tangential velocity to $1950^{+810}_{-530}\,$km/s, providing additional support to the D6 mechanism. Under the assumption that SDSSJ1637+3631 is a D6 survivor, we construct a kinematic model combining all astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric information, but also including the structure and gravitational potential of the Milky Way. Our model localises the ejection site to the inner few kpc of the Galactic disc (though excluding the Galactic centre), with an ejection speed of $1870^{+360}_{-300}\,$km/s, and a $4.5^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$Myr time of flight.

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction ($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2): $\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2} = 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation. Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations. Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type Ib SNe progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 In this White Paper, we present the potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to constrain the equation of state of dense matter in neutron stars, exploring regimes not directly accessible to terrestrial experiments. By observing a diverse population of neutron stars - including isolated objects, X-ray bursters, and accreting systems - eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry enables high-precision measurements of compactness, spin, surface temperature, polarimetric signals, and timing irregularity. These multifaceted observations, combined with advances in theoretical modeling, pave the way toward a comprehensive description of the properties and phases of dense matter from the crust to the core of neutron stars. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is planned to be launched in early 2030.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data. Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of 3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions. From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early evolution of compact HII regions.
#### The VMC Survey -- LIV. Anomalous Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds Period-Luminosity relations in the near-infrared bands

 - **Abstract**
 Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) are less studied metal-poor pulsating stars ([Fe/H]<-1.5) compared to Classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars. They follow distinct Period-Luminosity (PL) and Period-Wesenheit (PW) relations and pulsate in either the fundamental (F) or first overtone (1O) mode. Our goal is to assess the precision and accuracy of AC-based distances and evaluate their potential for establishing an independent distance scale. We derive new PL and PW relations for F-mode, 1O-mode, and, for the first time, combined F+1O ACs in the Magellanic Clouds. We study their wavelength dependence and apply the relations to estimate distances to Local Group stellar systems hosting ACs, while also confirming AC classifications. Our analysis is based on near-infrared time-series photometry in the Y, J, and Ks bands for about 200 ACs in the Magellanic Clouds from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC, 2009-2018). VMC data are complemented with optical photometry from Gaia DR3 and OGLE-IV, which also provide periods and pulsation modes. Custom light-curve templates were used to derive precise intensity-averaged magnitudes for 118 ACs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 75 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. These data were used to derive multi-band PL and PW relations, calibrated using the geometric LMC distance from eclipsing binaries. We find that PL relation slopes increase and dispersions decrease with wavelength. Using Gaia parallaxes, we determine the LMC distance modulus and the LMC-SMC relative distance. We also confirm the AC nature of several new candidates in Galactic Globular Clusters and derive a distance modulus for the Draco dSph galaxy of 19.425+/-0.048 mag. A 0.1 mag discrepancy with RR Lyrae-based distances may reflect metallicity effects. Future spectroscopic surveys and Gaia DR4 will help refine the AC distance scale and quantify metallicity impacts.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) continues to evade direct detection, but neutron stars (NSs) serve as natural laboratories where even a modest DM component can alter their structure. While many studies have examined DM effects on NSs, they often rely on specific choices of equations of state (EOS) models, assume isotropy, and lack a Bayesian statistical framework, limiting their predictive power. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework that couples pressure-anisotropic nuclear EOS to a self-interacting fermionic DM component, constrained by NICER and GW170817 data. Our results show that DM mass fractions up to $\sim10\%$ remain consistent with current data, which softens the high-density EOS, leading to reduced stellar radii and tidal deformabilities while requiring negligible pressure anisotropy. Bayesian model comparison reveals no statistically significant preference between pure baryonic and DM-admixed NSs, indicating that DM inclusion enhances physical realism without complexity penalties. However, existing data cannot tightly constrain the DM parameters, and our empirical radius definition introduces a systematic bias toward the DM core configurations. To address this, we therefore introduce the DM radius span $\Delta R_\chi \equiv R_{\chi,\mathrm{max}} - R_{\chi,\mathrm{min}}$ as a unified diagnostic for DM distributions. This parameter simultaneously characterizes core-halo transition features while exhibiting strong linear correlations ($\Delta R_\chi < 4\,\mathrm{km}$) with both DM and BM parameters, providing a clear avenue for future constraints. Our approach bridges current limitations and future potential in probing DM through compact star observations.
#### Submillimeter and Mid-Infrared Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the M17 HII Region

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164 bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450 and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.
#### High-resolution Observations of a C9.3 White-light Flare and Its Impact on the Solar Photosphere

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of a C9.3 white-light flare using high-resolution observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). The flare occurred near the eastern solar limb on September 11, 2023, within NOAA AR 13431, and produced beam electrons with energies just below 50 keV as observed by the the Hard X-ray Imager (HXI) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S). Two white-light flare kernels were detected in the TiO band, connected by filamentary brightenings aligned with penumbral fibrils, suggesting a photospheric contribution to the white-light emission. Notably, the impact of the flare on the solar photosphere was characterized by sudden vortex flows and significant amplification of magnetic field in the white-light flare kernel region. We infer that this impact is driven by the propagation of flare-generated Alfvén wave pulses, which deposited energy into the photosphere. These observations support the potential role of the Alfvén wave mechanism in driving energy transport and heating during white-light flares.

 - **Abstract**
 Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation history in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can provide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of K-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\it Chandra} observations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the Quintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all probable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature, non-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit, taking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds, which is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or carbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar abundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances, which may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in Quintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star winds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal mixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as expected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on the origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the Galactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow onto Sgr A*, are addressed.
#### The detection of spatially resolved protosteller outflows and episodic jets in the outer Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first detection of spatially resolved protostellar outflows and jets in the outer Galaxy. We observed five star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy (Sh 2--283, NOMF05-16/19/23/63; galactocentric distance = 15.7--17.4 kpc) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Towards Sh 2--283, we have detected distinct outflow ($\sim$5--50 km s$^{-1}$) and jet components ($\sim$50--100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the protostar in CO(3--2) emission. The outflows and jets are well-collimated, with the jets exhibiting multiple bullet structures. The position-velocity diagram along the CO flow axis shows two characteristic structures: (a) the flow velocity which linearly increases with the position offset from the core center (Hubble-like flow), and (b) continuous velocity components of the periodical flows (spine-like structures), which may indicate the episodic mass-ejection event. The time intervals of the mass-ejection events are estimated to be 900--4000 years based on the slopes of these spine-like structures. These characteristics align with those of nearby protostellar systems, indicating that early star formation in low-metallicity environments, such as the outer Galaxy, resembles that in the inner Galaxy. In contrast to the physical similarities, the $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio in the jet bullet appears to be lower than that measured in the low-mass protostellar sources in the inner Galaxy. This may indicate the different shock chemistry or different dust composition in the outer Galaxy source, although non-LTE effects could also affect the observed low $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio. We also report the new detection of the other 4 outflow sources in the outer Galaxy.
#### XRISM insights for interstellar Sulfur

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS), pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0 sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40% +/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of < 25%, which is consistent with prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar dark matter is a viable alternative to particle dark matter models such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS). This is particularly the case for scalars with a low mass $m \gtrsim 10^{-21} {\rm eV}$ as required to make quantum effects macroscopic on galactic scales. We point out that by synchronising the measurements of arrival times of pairs of pulsars, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA) could probe ultralight dark matter (ULDM) scenarios with a mass $10^{-23} {\rm eV}\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ that is greater than the one reached in standard analysis. The upper limit on the mass $m$ is set by the time lag $\Delta t$ between the observations of the two pulsars and could be pushed above $10^{-19} {\rm eV}$ for $\Delta t$ smaller than one hour.

 - **Abstract**
 Although all coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that propagate into the heliosphere should contain a magnetic flux rope (MFR) component, the majority do not exhibit the expected white-light MFR morphology of a leading edge plus cavity. This different appearance could be the result of distortion of the internal magnetic structure, merging with other structures, or simply projection effects. These factors complicate the interpretation of CMEs. This complexity is exemplified by a CME observed on 28 March 2022. The event originated from a single eruption, evolving as a textbook CME in the low corona but appearing as a complex two-MFR structure in white-light observations. Why? To answer this question, we performed a multi-view data and modeling analysis to describe the CME coronal evolution. The thermodynamic MHD model, CORHEL-CME, helps reveal the magnetic configuration of this CME and also reveals that the ambient field plays a crucial role in shaping the complex structure of the CME during early evolution. Our research underscores the importance of integrating multiview observations with physics-based models to gain a deeper insight into the development of complex CMEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon Radio Recombination Lines (CRRLs) at decametre wavelengths trace the diffuse phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. Their observation allows to measure physical parameters of this phase. We observed CRRLs with the recently commissioned New Extension in Nançay Upgrading LOFAR (NenuFAR) telescope towards two of the brightest sources at low-frequency (10-85 MHz): Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A (hereafter Cas A and Cyg A respectively), to measure the density n_e and temperature T_e of electrons in line-of-sight clouds. We used NenuFAR's beamforming mode, and we integrated several tens of hours on each source. The nominal spectral resolution was 95.4 Hz. We developed a pipeline to remove radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination and correct the baselines. We then fitted the spectral lines observed in absorption, associated to line-of-sight clouds. Cas A is the brightest source in the sky at low frequencies and represents an appropriate test bench for this new telescope. On this source, we detected 398 C\alpha lines between principal quantum numbers n=426 and n=826. C\alpha lines towards Cyg A were fainter. We stacked the signal by groups of a few tens of lines to improve the quality of our fitting process. On both sources we reached significantly higher S/N and spectral resolution than the most recent detections by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). The variation of line shape with n provides constraints on the physical properties of the clouds: T_e, n_e, the temperature T_0 of the radiation field, the mean turbulent velocity v_t and the typical size of the cloud. The NenuFAR observations sample a larger space volume than LOFAR's towards the same sources due to the differences in instrumental beamsizes, and the discrepancies highlight the sensitivity of low-frequency CRRLs as probes of the diffuse ISM, paving the way towards large area surveys of CRRLs in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation (SF) studies are benefiting from the huge amount of data made available by recent large-area Galactic plane surveys conducted between 2 {\mu}m and 3 mm. Fully characterizing SF demands integrating far-infrared/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) data, tracing the earliest phases, with near-/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) observations, revealing later stages characterized by YSOs just before main sequence star appearance. However, the resulting dataset is often a complex mix of heterogeneous and intricate features, limiting the effectiveness of traditional analysis in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships. In this framework, machine learning emerges as a powerful tool to handle the complexity of feature-rich datasets and investigate potential physical connections between the cold dust component traced by FIR/sub-mm emission and the presence of YSOs. We present a study on the evolutionary path of star forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey through a multi-step approach, with the final aims of (a) obtaining a robust and accurate set of features able to well classify the star forming clumps in Hi-GAL based on their evolutionary properties, (b) establishing whether a connection exists between the cold material reservoir in clumps, traced by FIR/sub-mm emission, and the already formed YSOs, precursors of stars. For these purposes, our designed experiments aim at testing whether the FIR/sub-mm properties related to clumps are sufficient to predict the clump evolutionary stage, without considering the direct information about the embedded YSOs at NIR/MIR. Our machine learning-based method involves a four-step approach, based on feature engineering, data handling, feature selection and classification. Our findings suggest that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary phases of star forming clumps, highlighting the complex and asynchronous nature of the SF process.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an irregular dwarf galaxy exhibiting evidence of recent and ongoing star formation. We performed a spatial clustering analysis of far-ultraviolet stars in the SMC younger than 150 Myr using data from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. We identified 236 young stellar structures as surface overdensities at different significance levels. The sizes of these structures range from a few parsecs to several hundred parsecs. Their irregular morphologies are characterized by a perimeter-area dimension, derived from the projected boundaries of the young stellar structures, of Dp = 1.46 +/- 0.4. The 2D fractal dimensions obtained from, respectively, the number-size relation and the size distribution are D2 = 1.64 +/- 0.03 and D2 = 1.31 +/- 0.16. These values indicate significant lumpiness among the young stellar structures. In addition, the surface density distribution of the identified structures follows a log-normal distribution. These features are strikingly similar to those of the turbulent interstellar medium, thus supporting the scenario of hierarchical star formation regulated by supersonic turbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the center of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an estimated mass of 3-4 $M_{\rm Jup}$, making it a contender for the least massive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs also exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon, which were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected in atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a deeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have identified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra for 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members of the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of $\sim2$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new members ($\sim2$ and 10 $M_{\rm Jup}$) exhibit large excess emission from circumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for planet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known member that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon features. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon detections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that the hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest newborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class "H" that is defined by the presence of the 3.4 $\mu$m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.
