#### Giant exoplanet composition: Why do the hydrogen-helium equation of state and interior structure matter?

 - **Abstract**
 Revealing the internal composition and structure of giant planets is fundamental for understanding planetary formation. However, the bulk composition can only be inferred through interior models. As a result, advancements in modelling aspects are essential to better characterise the interiors of giant planets. We investigate the effects of model assumptions such as the interior structure and the hydrogen-helium (H-He) equation of state (EOS) on the inferred interiors of giant exoplanets. We first assess these effects on a few test cases and compare H-He EOSs. We then calculate evolution models and infer the planetary bulk metallicity of 45 warm exoplanets, ranging from 0.1 to 10~$M_{\rm J}$. Planets with masses between about 0.2 and 0.6~$M_{\rm J}$ are most sensitive to the H-He EOS. Updating the H-He EOS reduces the inferred heavy-element mass, with an absolute difference in bulk metallicity of up to 13\%. Concentrating heavy elements in a core, rather than distributing them uniformly (and scaling opacities with metallicity), reduces the inferred metallicity (up to 17\%). The assumed internal structure, along with its effect on the envelope opacity, has the greatest effect on the inferred composition of massive planets ($M_{\rm p}>4~M_{\rm J}$). For $M_{\rm p}>0.6~M_{\rm J}$, the observational uncertainties on radii and ages lead to uncertainties in the inferred metallicity (up to 31\%) which are larger than the ones associated with the used H-He EOS and the assumed interior structure. However, for planets with $0.2<M_{\rm p}<0.6~M_{\rm J}$, the theoretical uncertainties are larger. Advancements in equations of state and our understanding of giant planet interior structures combined with accurate measurements of the planetary radius and age are crucial for characterising giant exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium of the Milky Way contains turbulent plasma with structures driven by energetic processes that fuel star formation and shape the evolution of our Galaxy. Radio waves from pulsars are scattered off the small (au-scale and below) structures, resulting in frequency-dependent interference patterns that are modulated in time because of the relative motions of the pulsar, Earth, and plasma. Power spectral analyses of these patterns show parabolic arcs with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of individual structures. Here we report the discovery of at least 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437$-$4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient insterstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 Melnick 34 (Mk 34) is one of the most massive binary systems known and is one of the brightest X-ray point sources in the 30 Doradus region. We investigated the impact of this massive system on the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM) using the optical spectroscopic capabilities of the narrow-field mode (NFM) of the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). MUSE-NFM spatially resolved the ISM in the vicinity of Mk 34 with a resolution comparable to that of the HST. The analysis of the [NII]$\lambda$6583 and [SII]$\lambda$6717 emission lines reveals a cone-like structure apparently originating from Mk 34 and extending southeast. Electron density maps and radial velocity measurements of the ISM lines further support an outflow scenario traced by these emissions. While no clear northwestern counterpart to this outflow was observed, we note increased extinction in that direction, towards the R136 cluster. The ISM material along the projected diagonal of the outflow on both sides of Mk 34 shows similar properties in terms of the emission line ratios seen in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram. These results are consistent across two observational epochs. Additionally, we examined the residual maps within a 0.5" radius of Mk 34 after modeling and subtracting the point spread function. The observed variations in the residuals could potentially be linked to Mk 34's known periodic behavior. However, further observations with appropriate cadence are needed to fully monitor the 155 day periodicity of Mk 34's X-ray emissions.

 - **Abstract**
 Among massive stars, binary interaction is the rule rather than the exception. The closest binaries, those with periods of less than about 10 days, undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, with many of them experiencing a nuclear-timescale contact phase. Current binary population synthesis models predict the mass-ratio distribution of contact binaries to be heavily skewed toward a mass ratio of unity, which is inconsistent with observations. It has been shown that effects of tidal deformation due to the Roche potential, as well as energy transfer in the common layers of a contact binary, alter the internal structure of close binary components. However, previous population studies neglected these effects. We model a population of massive binary stars that undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, while consistently considering the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer in contact phases. We use the MESA binary-evolution code to compute large grids of models with primary star masses of $8\,M_\odot$ to $70\,M_\odot$ at Solar metallicity. We then perform a population synthesis study to predict distribution functions of the observational properties of close binary systems, focusing in particular on the mass and luminosity ratio distribution. We find that the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer have a limited effect on the predicted mass-ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Only a small fraction of the population has their mass ratio significantly shifted toward a more unequal configuration. However, we suggest that orbital hardening could affect the evolution of contact binaries and their progenitors, and we advocate for a homogeneous set of observed contact binary parameters.
#### Constraining core-to-envelope differential rotation in gamma-doradus stars from inertial dips properties

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dips in the gravito-inertial modes period-spacing pattern of gamma-Dor stars is now well established by recent asteroseismic studies. Such Lorentzian-shaped inertial dips arise from the interaction of gravito-inertial modes propagating in the radiative envelope of intermediate-mass main sequence stars with pure inertial modes that propagate in their convective core. We aim to investigate the signature of a differential rotation between the convective core and the near-core region inside gamma-Dor stars from the inertial dip properties. We first describe the bi-layer rotation profile we use and the approximations we adopt to maintain the analyticity of our study. We then describe our results on the inertial dip formation, location, and shape. We derive a modified Lorentzian profile and we compare it to the previously obtained results in the solid-body rotation case. This work highlights the inertial dips' probing power of the convective core rotation, an important observable in the context of the understanding of the angular momentum transport and chemicals mixing inside stars.
#### Variable structures in the stellar wind of the HMXB Vela X-1

 - **Abstract**
 Strong stellar winds are an important feature in wind-accreting high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems, providing insights into stellar evolution and their impact on surrounding environments. However, the long-term evolution and temporal variability of these winds are not fully understood. This work probes the archetypal wind-accreting HMXB Vela X-1 using MAXI observations over 14 years, focusing on orbit-to-orbit absorption variability in the 2-10 keV band. Additionally, the relation between hardness ratio trends in binary orbits and neutron star spin states is investigated. We calculate hardness ratios to track absorption variability, comparing flux changes across energy bands, as the effect of absorption on the flux is energy-dependent. Variability is analyzed by comparing hardness ratio trends across binary orbits to the MAXI long-term averaged evolution. The long-term averaged hardness ratio evolution displays a stable pattern. Yet, individual binary orbits reveal different hardness ratio evolutions between consecutive orbits with no evident periodicity. Less than half of the binary orbits align with the long-term evolution. Moreover, neutron star spin-up episodes exhibit harder-than-average hardness trends compared to spin-down episodes, although their distributions overlap considerably. The long-term averaged hardness ratio dispersion is consistent with absorption column densities reported in literature from shorter observations, suggesting that heterogeneous wind structures, including accretion wakes and wind clumps, drive observed variations. The orbit-to-orbit variability indicates that pointed X-ray observations provide limited insight into wind structure. The link between neutron star spin states and hardness trends underscores the influence of accretion on absorption, with variability tied to stellar wind density fluctuations.
#### Comparison of chemical compositions between the bright and faint red clumps for the metal-poor and metal-rich populations in the Milky Way bulge

 - **Abstract**
 We examined the double red clump (RC) observed in the Galactic bulge, interpreted as a difference in distance ("X-shaped bulge scenario") or in chemical composition ("multiple population scenario"). To verify chemical differences between the RC groups, we performed low-resolution spectroscopy for RC and red giant branch (RGB) stars using Gemini-South/GMOS in three fields of the bulge, and collected diverse data from literature. We divided our sample stars not only into bright and faint RC groups, but also into bluer ([Fe/H] < -0.1) and redder ([Fe/H] > -0.1) groups following the recent u-band photometric studies. For the metal-poor stars, no statistically significant difference in CN index was detected between the bright and faint RC groups for all observed fields. However, we found, from cross-matching with high-resolution spectroscopic data, a sign of Na enhancement in the "metal-poor and bright" RC group compared to the "metal-poor and faint" group at (l,b)=(-1 deg,-8.5 deg). When the contributions of the RGB stars on the RC regimes are taken into account, the Na abundance difference between genuine RCs would correspond to approximately 0.23 dex, similar to globular cluster (GCs) with multiple populations. In contrast, the metal-rich stars do not show chemical differences between the bright and faint RCs. It implies that the double RC observed in the metal-poor component of the bulge might be linked to the multiple populations originated from GC-like subsystem, whereas that of the metal-rich component would have produced by the X-shaped structure. Our results support the previous studies suggesting composite nature of the Milky Way bulge.
#### Reassessing Sub-Neptune Structure, Radii, and Thermal Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel python-based 1D sub-Neptune evolution model that emphasizes the thermal evolution and potential solidification of the rock/iron core and the structure of the radiative atmosphere. This model explores planetary structure from the molten center to nbar pressure levels. Treating the radiative atmosphere is crucial for sub-Neptunes, due to the large scale height and low gravity, which contributes up to 40\% of their observed radius, especially for low-mass, highly irradiated planets. Consequently, we generically find that lower H/He mass fractions are needed to match a given planetary radius, compared to previous work. While the presence of metal-enrichment in the H/He layers (here modeled as 50$\times$ solar) does not substantially influence the size of the convective envelope, it notably reduces the transit radius by shrinking the radiative atmospheric scale height. Sub-Neptunes cool differently from terrestrial planets, with the rock/iron core's cooling rate limited by the envelope, leading to longer solidification timescales. Complete solidification of the silicate mantle by 10 Gyr is found only for planets with very low masses ($\leq 1M_\oplus$) and small H/He envelopes ($\leq$ 0.1\%). Dynamo action in sub-Neptune iron cores persists as long as the mantle surface remains molten, often exceeding 10 Gyr, and becomes sensitive to core thermal conductivity after solidification. We examine aspects of ''boil-off,'' which sets the maximum allowed H/He mass and planetary radius for subsequent evolution. The rock/iron's cooling energy moderately decreases the post-boil-off H/He mass fraction in planets with large atmospheric scale heights only.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the impact of covariance within uncertainties on the inference of cosmological and astrophysical parameters, specifically focusing on galaxy stellar mass functions derived from the CAMELS simulation suite. Utilizing both Fisher analysis and Implicit Likelihood Inference (ILI), we explore how different covariance structures, including simple toy models and physics-motivated uncertainties, affect posterior distributions and parameter variances. Our methodology utilizes forward modeling via emulators that are trained on CAMELS simulations to produce stellar mass functions based on input parameters, subsequently incorporating Gaussian noise as defined by covariance matrices. We examine both toy model covariance matrices and physically motivated covariance matrices derived from observational factors like the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) and photometric aperture size. Our results demonstrate that covariance terms significantly influence parameter inference, often leading to tighter constraints or revealing complex, multimodal posterior distributions. These findings underscore the necessity of accounting for covariance when interpreting astrophysical observations, especially in fields where accurate parameter estimation is critical for model validation and hypothesis testing.
#### Causality for first-order phase transition and its implication to neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 Causality is an important factor determining the maximum mass of a neutron star. Previous works studies causality for smooth equation of state. The density at the core of neutron stars can be few times nuclear saturation density, where the occurrence of first-order phase transition has not been ruled out. The causality condition for first-order phase transition is characteristically different from the causality condition of smooth equation of state which can be evident in the mass-radius expression. In this letter we examine the causality condition for first-order phase transition and its observational significance in the mass-radius sequence. We find that equation of state having first-order phase transition, the causality line deviates considerably from the that of smooth equation of state. Depending on the strength of the discontinuity and the onset density of phase transition there is a narrow band in the mass-radius plot which is available only to the stars having smooth equation of state. This can have significant consequence in the sense that if some pulsars are to lie in this band one can rule out equation of state having first-order phase transition occurring at that particular onset density.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21945

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid cooling of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A is speculated to arise from an enhanced neutrino emission caused by the onset of $^3P_2$-wave neutron superfluidity in the core. However, the neutrino emissivity due to Cooper-pair breaking and formation is too small to yield the observed cooling rate. Here, we show that such a rapid cooling can be explained once the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the non-superfluid neutron liquid induced by superfluid quantum criticality is included into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling, without assuming the existence of additional energy loss processes. Our results indicate that the neutron star in Cassiopeia A remains in the thermal relaxation stage, which is greatly prolonged by the non-Fermi liquid behavior. The good agreement between our theoretical results and recent observational cooling data points to the pivotal role played by superfluid quantum criticality in neutron stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exploration of the Milky Way's structural parameters using an all-sky sample of RC giants to map the stellar density from the inner to the outer parts of the Galactic disc. These evolved giants are considered to be standard candles due to their low intrinsic variance in their absolute luminosities, allowing us to estimate their distances with reasonable confidence. We exploit all-sky photometry from the AllWISE mid-infrared survey and the Gaia survey, along with astrometry from Gaia Data Release 3 and recent 3D extinction maps, to develop a probabilistic scheme in order to select with high confidence \rc{}-like stars. Our curated catalogue contains about 10 million sources, for which we estimate photometric distances based on the WISE $W1$ photometry. We then derive the selection function for our sample, which is the combined selection function of sources with both \gaia{} and \allwise{} photometry. Using the distances and accounting for the full selection function of our observables, we are able to fit a two-disc, multi-parameter model to constrain the scale height (\hz{}), scale-length (\rd{}), flaring, and the relative mass ratios of the two disc components. We illustrate and verify our methodology using mock catalogues of \rc{} stars. We find that the \rc{} population is best described by a flared thin disc with scale length \rd{}=$3.56\pm0.32$ kpc and scale height at the Sun of \hzsun{}=$0.17\pm0.01$ kpc, and a shorter and thicker disc with \rd{}=$2.59\pm0.11$ kpc, \hzsun{}=$0.45\pm0.11$ kpc, with no flare. The thicker disc constitutes 64\% of the \rc{} stellar mass beyond 3 kpc, while the thin disk shows evidence of being warped beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic center. The residuals between the predicted number density of RC stars from our axisymmetric model and the measured counts show possible evidence of a two-armed spiral perturbation in the disc of the Milky Way.
#### SN 1885A and supernova remnants in the centre of M31 with LOFAR

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first LOFAR image of the centre of M31 at a frequency of 150 MHz. We clearly detect three supernova remnants, which, along with archival VLA data at 3 GHz and other published radio and X-ray data allows us to characterize them in detail. Our observations also allow us to obtain upper limits the historical SN 1885A which is undetected even at a low frequency of 150 MHz. From analytical modelling we find that SN 1885A will stay in its free-expansion phase for at least another couple of centuries. We find an upper limit of $n_{\rm H}~\lesssim 0.04$ cm$^{-3}$ for the interstellar medium of SN 1885A, and that the SN ejecta density is not shallower than $\propto r^{-9}$ (on average). From the $2.6\sigma$ tentative detection in X-ray, our analysis shows that non-thermal emission is expected to dominate the SN 1885A emission. Comparing our results with those on G1.9+0.3, we find that it is likely that the asymmetries in G1.9+0.3 make it a more efficient radio and X-ray emitter than SN 1885A. For Braun 80, 95 and 101, the other remnants in this region, we estimate ages of 5200, 8100, and 13,100 years, and shock speeds of 1150, 880, and 660 km s$^{-1}$}, respectively. Based on this, the supernova rate in the central 0.5 kpc $\times$ 0.6 kpc of M31 is at least one per $\sim 3000~{\rm yr}$. We estimate radio spectral indices of $-0.66\pm0.05$, $-0.37\pm0.03$ and $-0.50\pm0.03$ for the remnants, respectively, which match fairly well with previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Many nucleosynthetic channels create the elements, but two-parameter models characterized by $\alpha$ and Fe nonetheless predict stellar abundances in the Galactic disk to accuracies of 0.02 to 0.05 dex for most measured elements, near the level of current abundance uncertainties. It is difficult to make individual measurements more precise than this to investigate lower-amplitude nucleosynthetic effects, but population studies of mean abundance patterns can reveal more subtle abundance differences. Here we look at the detailed abundances for 67315 stars from APOGEE DR17, but in the form of abundance residuals away from a best-fit two-parameter, data-driven nucleosynthetic model. We find that these residuals show complex structures with respect to age, guiding radius, and vertical action that are not random and are also not strongly correlated with sources of systematic error such as surface gravity, effective temperature, and radial velocity. The residual patterns, especially in Na, C+N, Ni, Mn, and Ce, trace kinematic structures in the Milky Way, such as the inner disk, thick disk, and flared outer disk. A principal component analysis suggests that most of the observed structure is low-dimensional and can be explained by a few eigenvectors. We find that some, but not all, of the effects in the low-$\alpha$ disk can be explained by dilution with fresh gas, so that abundance ratios resemble those of stars with higher metallicity. The patterns and maps we provide could be combined with accurate forward models of nucleosynthesis, star formation, and gas infall to provide a more detailed picture of star and element formation in different Milky Way components.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio pulsars allow the study of the ionised interstellar medium and its dispersive effects, a major noise source in gravitational wave searches using pulsars. In this paper, we compare the functionality and reliability of three commonly used schemes to measure temporal variations in interstellar propagation effects in pulsar-timing data. We carry out extensive simulations at low observing frequencies (100-200 MHz) by injecting long-term correlated noise processes with power-law spectra and white noise, to evaluate the robustness, accuracy and precision of the following three mitigation methods: epoch-wise (EW) measurements of interstellar dispersion; the DMX method of simultaneous, piece-wise fits to interstellar dispersion; and DMGP, which models dispersion variations through Gaussian processes using a Bayesian analysis method. We then evaluate how reliably the input signals are reconstructed and how the various methods react to the presence of achromatic long-period noise. All the methods perform well, provided the achromatic long-period noise is modeled for DMX and DMGP. The most precise method is DMGP, followed by DMX and EW, while the most accurate is EW, followed by DMX and DMGP. We also test different scenarios including simulations of L-band ToAs and realistic DM injection, with no significant variation in the obtained results. Given the nature of our simulations and our scope, we deem that EW is the most reliable method to study the Galactic ionized media. Future works should be conducted to confirm this result via more realistic simulations. We note that DM GP and DMX seem to be the most performing techniques in removing long-term correlated noise, and hence for gravitational wave studies. However, full simulations of pulsar timing array experiments are needed to support this interpretation.
#### Confinement of relativistic particles in the vicinity of accelerators: a key for understanding the anomalies in secondary cosmic rays

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmic ray (CR) measurements have revealed unexpected anomalies in secondary CRs, namely deviations from the predictions of the so-called standard Galactic CR paradigm regarding the composition and energy spectra of the products of interactions of primary (accelerated) CRs with interstellar gas: (i) antiparticles (positrons and antiprotons), (ii) light elements of the (Li, Be, B) group, and (iii) diffuse gamma rays. We argue that the new measurements can still be explained within the standard CR paradigm but with an additional assumption that CRs spend a significant part of their lifetime near their formation sites. The latter can be realized if CRs propagate more slowly in these localized regions than in the interstellar medium (ISM). Postulating that CRs accumulate on average energy-independent "grammage" of $0.7 \ \rm g/cm^2$ near the major contributors to galactic CRs, one can explain self-consistently the new measurements of the B/C ratio by DAMPE and the diffuse ultra-high-energy gamma-rays by LHAASO, involving a minimal number of model parameters: the energy-dependent "grammage" in the interstellar medium $\rm \lambda \approx 8 (E/10 \ GeV)^{-0.55}~\rm g/cm^{2}$ and the average CR acceleration (sourcee) spectrum, $\rm Q(E) \propto E^{-2.3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a time-resolved analysis of the accreting X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 using observations carried out by NuSTAR, which cover approximately two binary orbits in different intensity states. The pulse profile is relatively stable over the orbital phase and shows energy dependence. It has an obvious double-peaked shape in the energy band below 15 keV -- with the second pulse peak decreasing as energy increases -- and is gradually dominated by a single peak in higher energy bands. We find that the pulse profile in the energy band of 3-5 keV at high-intensity states shows a subtle triple-peaked shape, with the main peak divided into two subpeaks. We also find a positive correlation between the pulse fraction and both energy and flux. Our spectral analysis reveals that the spectra can be well described by the continuum of Fermi-Dirac cutoff and NPEX models, and the cyclotron line is detected with the centroid energies varying from 26 keV to 29 keV, along with the iron emission line around 6.4 keV. We investigated the dependence between the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy and luminosity and discuss the theoretical critical luminosity. Although the variation of $E_{\rm cyc}- L_X$ is not distinct, there is a possibility that the critical luminosity lies within the range of $\sim (0.5-4)\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the band of $4-78$ keV. The photon index shows a strong positive correlation with luminosity. Our orbital-phase analysis reveals that the spectral parameters show orbital variability, and the highly variable photoelectric absorption may indicate the existence of clumpy stellar winds.

 - **Abstract**
 The innermost portions of the Milky Way's stellar halo have avoided scrutiny until recently. The lack of wide-area survey data, made it difficult to reconstruct an uninterrupted view of the density distribution of the metal-poor stars inside the Solar radius. In this study, we utilize red giant branch (RGB) stars from Gaia, with metallicities estimated using spectro-photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. Accounting for Gaia's selection function, we examine the spatial distribution of metal-poor ([M/H]<-1.3) RGB stars, from the Galactic centre (r~1 kpc) out to beyond the Solar radius (r~18 kpc). Our best-fitting single-component cored power-law model shows a vertical flattening of ~0.5 and a slope -3.4, consistent with previous studies. Motivated by the mounting evidence for two distinct stellar populations in the inner halo, we additionally test a range of two-component models. One of the components models the tidal debris from the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus merger, while the other captures the Aurora population -- stars that predate the Galactic disk formation. Our best-fit two-component model suggests that both populations contribute equally around the Solar radius, but Aurora dominates the inner halo with a steeper power-law index of -4.5, in agreement with the nitrogen-rich star distribution measured by Horta et al. (2021).

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are beamed active galactic nuclei known for their strong multi-wavelength variability on timescales from years down to minutes. We aim to investigate the suitability of the twisting jet model presented in previous works to explain the multi-wavelength behaviour of BL Lacertae, the prototype of one of the blazar classes. According to this model, the jet is inhomogeneous, curved, and twisting, and the long-term variability is due to changes in the Doppler factor due to variations in the orientation of the jet-emitting regions. We analysed optical data of the source obtained during monitoring campaigns organised by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) in 2019-2022, together with radio data from the WEBT and other teams, and gamma-ray data from the Fermi satellite. In this period, BL Lacertae underwent an extraordinary activity phase, reaching its historical optical and gamma-ray brightness maxima. The application of the twisting jet model to the source light curves allows us to infer the wiggling motion of the optical, radio, and gamma-ray jet-emitting regions. The optical-radio correlation shows that the changes in the radio viewing angle follow those in the optical viewing angle by about 120 days, and it suggests that the jet is composed of plasma filaments, which is in agreement with some radio high-resolution observations of other sources. The gamma-ray emitting region is found to be co-spatial with the optical one, and the analysis of the gamma-optical correlation is consistent with both the geometric interpretation and a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) origin of the high-energy photons. We propose a geometric scenario where the jet is made up of a pair of emitting plasma filaments in a sort of double-helix curved rotating structure, whose wiggling motion produces changes in the Doppler beaming and can thus explain the observed multi-wavelength long-term variability.
