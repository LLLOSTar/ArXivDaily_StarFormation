 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological evolution of the luminosity and redshift of FRBs. As is the case for all extragalactic sources, we are dealing with data that are truncated by observational selection effects, the most important being the flux limit, which introduces the so-called Eddington-Malmquist bias. In addition, for FRBs, there is a significant uncertainty in the redshifts obtained from the observed dispersion measures. To correct for the truncation we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron- Petrosian and Lynden-Bell methods, which give unbiased distributions of luminosities and redshifts and their cosmological evolution. To quantify the redshift uncertainty, we use a data set, which in addition to a mean redshift, gives the one-sigma errors. We construct three samples with lower, mean, and upper redshifts and apply the above methods to each. For the three samples, we find similar (1) > 2.5{\sigma} evidence for luminosity evolution, (2) a luminosity function that can be fit by a simple broken power law, and (3) a comoving density formation rate that decreases rapidly with redshift unlike the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). This rate is similar to that of short gamma-ray bursts, which are believed to result from compact star mergers with a formation rate delayed relative to the SFR. This may further support the hypothesis that magnetars are the progenitors of FRBs.
#### Laboratory rotational spectra of cyanocyclohexane and its siblings (1- and 4-cyanocyclohexene) using a compact CP-FTMW spectrometer for interstellar detection

 - **Abstract**
 Chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy is a versatile technique to record broadband gas-phase rotational spectra, enabling detailed investigations of molecular structure, dynamics, and hyperfine interactions. Here, we present the development and application of a CP-FTMW spectrometer operating in the 6.5-18 GHz frequency range, studying cyanocyclohexane, 1-cyanocyclohexene, and 4-cyanocyclohexene using a heated pulsed supersonic expansion source. The dynamic range, experimental resolution, and high sensitivity enable observation of multiple conformers, precise measurements of hyperfine splitting arising from nuclear quadrupole coupling due to the nitrogen atom in the cyano group, as well as the observation of singly $^{13}$C- and $^{15}$N-substituted isotopic isomers in natural abundance. Using the latter, precise structures for the molecules are derived. The accurate rotational spectra enabled a search for these species toward the dark, cold molecular cloud TMC-1; no signals are found, and we discuss the implications of derived upper limits on the interstellar chemistry of the cyanocyclohexane family.

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic edge at Galactocentric distances of 14\,--\,22\,kpc provides an ideal laboratory to study molecular clouds in an environment that is different from the solar neighborhood, due to its lower gas density, lower metallicity, and little or no perturbation from the spiral arms. Observations of CO\,($J$\,=\,2--1) spectral lines were carried out towards 72 molecular clouds located at the Galactic edge using the IRAM\,30\,m telescope. Combined with CO\,($J$\,=\,1--0) data from the MWISP project, we investigate the variations of $R_{21}$ across these Galactic edge clouds, with $R_{21}$ representing CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratios. These are found to range from 0.3 to 3.0 with a mean of 1.0\,$\pm$\,0.1 in the Galactic edge clouds. The proportions of very low ratio gas (VLRG; $R_{21}$\,<\,0.4), low ratio gas (LRG; 0.4\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,<\,0.7), high ratio gas (HRG; 0.7\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,<\,1.0), and very high ratio gas (VHRG; $R_{21}$\,$\ge$\,1.0) are 6.9\%, 29.2\%, 26.4\%, and 37.5\%, respectively, indicating a significant presence of high $R_{21}$ ratio molecular gas within these regions. In our Galaxy, the $R_{21}$ ratio exhibits a gradient of initial radial decline followed by a high dispersion with increasing Galacticentric distance and a prevalence for high ratio gas. There is no apparent systematic variation within the Galactocentric distance range of 14 to 22\,kpc. A substantial proportion of HRG and VHRG is found to be associated with compact clouds and regions displaying star-forming activity, suggesting that the high $R_{21}$ ratios may stem from dense gas concentrations and recent episodes of star formation.
#### Disentangling the Effects of Temperature, Clouds, and Gravity on K I doublet in L dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of surface gravity, effective temperature, and cloudiness on the potassium doublet (\ion{K}{1}) at 1.17 {\mu}m in brown dwarf spectra. Using pseudo-Voigt profiles to fit the \ion{K}{1} doublet in Sonora Diamondback atmospheric model spectra, we find that gravity and cloudiness affect the spectra differently in mid to late-L dwarfs. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is strongly correlated with surface gravity, while the maximum depth strongly correlates with cloudiness. This method allows us to separate the effects of clouds and surface gravity on the \ion{K}{1} 1.17 {\mu}m doublet. We also find that the FWHM and maximum depth of the doublet can help to estimate the effective temperature and surface gravity in early to mid-L dwarfs.
