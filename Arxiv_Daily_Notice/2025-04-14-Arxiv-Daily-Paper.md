#### Dark matter decay signals in cosmic filaments

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments form the backbone of the cosmic web, yet their properties and evolution remain uncertain. Using the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the dark matter density profiles in filaments and their implications for dark matter decay signals. We show that GeV-scale dark matter particles decaying into electron-positron pairs can produce detectable radio synchrotron emission. By leveraging stacked filament radio data, we place stringent constraints on the dark matter decay lifetime, improving existing limits by up to two orders of magnitude for strong filamentary magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We study the individual and cumulative impact of stellar feedback processes on massive black hole (MBH) growth in a simulated low-mass dwarf galaxy. Methods. A suite of high-resolution radiation-hydrodynamic simulations called Noctua is performed, using the ArepoNoctua numerical framework for BHs in galaxy simulations. The chemical evolution of the gas is explicitly modelled in a time-dependent non-equilibrium way. Two types of stellar feedback are considered: individually-traced type II supernova (SNII) explosions, and radiatively transferred (on-the-fly) ionising stellar radiation (ISR) from OB stars. As part of the numerical framework, we develop and apply a novel physically-motivated model for MBH gas accretion, taking into account the angular momentum of the gas in the radiatively efficient regime, to estimate the gas accretion rate from the sub-grid accretion disc. Results. Without any stellar feedback, an initial $10^4~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ MBH is able to steadily grow over time, roughly doubling its mass after 800 Myr. Surprisingly, the growth of the MBH is more than doubled when only ISR feedback is considered, compared to the no stellar feedback run. This is due to the star formation rate (SFR) being highly suppressed (to a similar level or slightly above that when SNII feedback is considered), enabling a higher cumulative net gas inflow onto the MBH from not only the cold neutral- and molecular medium phases, but also the unstable- and warm neutral medium phases. With SNII feedback included, the gas accretion onto the MBH is episodic over time, and is suppressed by more than an order of magnitude already during the first 150 Myr. When combining SNII with ISR feedback, the growth of the MBH remains suppressed due to SNII feedback, but to a lesser extent compared to the SNII-only feedback run, due to a slightly lower SFR, and hence a reduced number of SNII events.
#### On the nature of spiral arms in the interacting galaxy M51

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigated the radial variation of the azimuthal propagation of star formation across the spiral arms in the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 (M51a) by analysing the spatial separation between young star clusters and their nearest HII regions. The significant differences in the radial profiles of the mean azimuthal offsets in the M51a arms were found when the southern and northern arms were studied separately. The northern arm analysis showed that its radial profile is consistent with the predictions of stationary density wave theory for trailing spirals, while the explanation of the radial profile for the southern arm required its pattern speed to be higher than the rotation velocity of disc matter within the corotation circle, and lower than that outside of it. At the same time, these different radial profiles of the mean azimuthal offset in the two arms are joined by a common localization of corotation resonances, confirmed by independent studies using different methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, stellar rotation has emerged as a key factor in shaping the morphology of color-magnitude diagrams of young and intermediate-age star clusters. In this study, we use MUSE integral-field spectroscopy to investigate the stellar rotation of ~2300 stars in the 1.5 Gyr old cluster NGC 1783 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The effective temperature, surface gravity, radial velocity, and projected rotational velocity ($v\mathrm{sin}i$) of the entire sample were obtained within a Bayesian framework to derive robust estimates of these parameters along with their associated errors. The analysis shows that stars along the extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) cover a wide range of rotational velocities, from values consistent with no/slow rotation up to $v\mathrm{sin}i$ ~ 250 km/s. The distribution of stellar rotation velocities appears to play a crucial role in explaining the broadening of the eMSTO in this cluster, and a correlation is observed between $v\mathrm{sin}i$ and the color of the eMSTO stars, with $v\mathrm{sin}i$ increasing as the color becomes redder. Among the eMSTO stars, we investigate the peculiar population of stars strongly dimmed in the UV (so-called UV-dim stars), recently discovered in NGC 1783. UV-dim stars show clear photometric evidence of self-extinction and mild spectroscopic signatures typically observed in shell stars, thus suggesting that they have likely a decretion disc observed nearly equator-on. Interestingly, the study also shows that a significant fraction of UV-dim stars are slow rotators. We discuss potential implications these results may have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of UV-dim stars and we propose that the rotational properties of the UV-dim stars should vary with cluster age.

 - **Abstract**
 The current generation of millimeter receivers is able to produce cubes of 800 000 pixels by 200 000 frequency channels to cover several square degrees over the 3 mm atmospheric window. Estimating the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) with an astrophysical model on such datasets is challenging. Common approaches tend to converge to local minima and typically poorly reconstruct regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). This instrumental revolution thus calls for new scalable data analysis techniques. We present Beetroots, a Python software that performs Bayesian reconstruction of maps of physical conditions from observation maps and an astrophysical model. It relies on an accurate statistical model, exploits spatial regularization to guide estimations, and uses state-of-the-art algorithms. It also assesses the ability of the astrophysical model to explain the observations, providing feedback to improve ISM models. We demonstrate the power of Beetroots with the Meudon PDR code on synthetic data, and then apply it to estimate physical condition maps in the full Orion molecular cloud 1 (OMC-1) star forming region based on Herschel molecular line emission maps. The application to the synthetic case shows that Beetroots can currently analyse maps with up to ten thousand pixels, addressing large variations of S/N, escaping from local minima, and providing consistent uncertainty quantifications. On a laptop, the inference runtime ranges from a few minutes for 100-pixel maps to 28 hours for 8100-pixel maps. The results on the OMC-1 maps are consistent with independent estimations from the literature, and improve our understanding of the region. This work paves the way towards systematic and rigorous analyses of observations produced by current and future instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Filament eruptions are considered to be a common phenomenon on the Sun and other stars, yet they are rarely directly imaged in the meter and decimeter wavebands. Using imaging data from the DAocheng solar Radio Telescope (DART) in the 150-450 MHz frequency range, we present two eruptive filaments that manifest as radio dimmings (i.e., emission depressions). Simultaneously, portions of these eruptive filaments are discernible as dark features in the chromospheric images. The sun-as-a-star flux curves of brightness temperature, derived from the DART images, exhibit obvious radio dimmings. The dimming depths range from 1.5% to 8% of the background level and show a negative correlation with radio frequencies and a positive correlation with filament areas. Our investigation suggests that radio dimming is caused by free-free absorption during filament eruptions obscuring the solar corona. This may provide a new method for detecting stellar filament eruptions.
#### Hadronic emission from the environment of the Crab Pulsar Wind Nebula by re-accelerated particles

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of peta-electronvolt (PeV) $\gamma$-ray photons from the Crab Nebula by LHAASO has revitalised the possibility of a secondary population of hadrons producing the highest energy emission through neutral pion decay. Despite previous studies modelling this population, the origin of such high-energy hadronic particles remains unclear. We consider possible acceleration scenarios for multi PeV particles in the Crab Nebula environment, including one in which high-energy protons produced at the supernova remnant's outer shock diffuse into the pulsar wind nebula. Particles which reach the Crab Pulsar's wind termination shock can be accelerated to the required energies, and subsequently interact with the dense filaments surrounding the nebula. We perform particle transport simulations of this scenario, including the effects of the expansion of the pulsar wind nebula into the surrounding supernova ejecta. We find that this results in PeV photons being produced over the lifetime of the Crab system, without over-estimating the flux at lower energies or exceeding the energy budget of the Crab Pulsar. This results in a reasonable match to the LHAASO data at the highest energies. We also present predictions for the resulting all-flavour neutrino flux, finding it to be approximately an order of magnitude below the sensitivity of current generation instruments.
#### Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model: Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness

 - **Abstract**
 The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\varepsilon_{\text{trans}}/\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\Delta \varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\Delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 > 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.
#### Constraints on diffuse X-ray Emission from the TeV halo Candidate HESS J1813-126

 - **Abstract**
 Extended regions of very high energy $\gamma$-ray emission associated with middle-aged pulsars have been found by $\gamma$-ray observatories. These regions, called TeV halos or pulsar halos, are thought to be created when energetic electrons from a pulsar or pulsar wind nebula transport into interstellar medium and undergo inverse Compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background radiation. The same electrons are expected to emit synchrotron emission in the X-ray band in the interstellar magnetic field. HESS J1813-126 is a pulsar halo candidate from which TeV $\gamma$-ray emission with extension 0.21\degr and a hard $E^{-2}$ spectrum is observed. We searched for the synchrotron component of this pulsar halo with Swift-XRT. In particular, we observed two fields within the region covered by HESS J1813-126 for 35 ksec each and a region nearby as a background reference for 10 ksec. We find no evidence for excess X-ray emission from the two observations near HESS J1813-126 and place an upper limit differential flux of $4.32\times 10^{-4}\, \rm keV^{-1}\, cm^{-2}\,s^{-1} $ and $5.38\times 10^{-4}\, \rm keV^{-1}\, cm^{-2}\,s^{-1} $ at 1 keV assuming an $E^{-2}$ power law spectrum. The non-detection implies that the magnetic field inside the halo is not significantly enhanced compared to the average Galactic magnetic field.
