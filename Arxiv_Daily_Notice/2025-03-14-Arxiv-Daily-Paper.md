 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution solar observations have unveiled the presence of small-scale loop-like structures in the lower solar atmosphere, often referred to as unresolved fine structures, low-lying loops, and miniature hot loops. These structures undergo rapid changes within minutes, and their formation mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of two small loops utilizing data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory, and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), aiming to elucidate the underlying process behind their formation. The GST observations revealed that these loops, with lengths of $\sim$3.5 Mm and heights of $\sim$1 Mm, manifest as bright emission structures in H$\alpha$ wing images, particularly prominent in the red wing. IRIS observations showcased these loops in 1330 angstrom slit-jaw images, with TR and chromospheric line spectra exhibiting significant enhancement and broadening above the loops, indicative of plasmoid-mediated reconnection during their formation. Additionally, we observed upward-erupting jets above these loops across various passbands. Furthermore, differential emission measurement analysis reveals an enhanced emission measure at the location of these loops, suggesting the presence of plasma exceeding 1 MK. Based on our observations, we propose that these loops and associated jets align with the minifilament eruption model. Our findings suggest a unified mechanism governing the formation of small-scale loops and jets akin to larger-scale X-ray jets.
#### The Shamrock code: I- Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics on GPUs
 - **Authors:** Timothée David--Cléris, Guillaume Laibe, Yona Lapeyre
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09713

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09713

 - **Abstract**
 We present Shamrock, a performance portable framework developed in C++17 with the SYCL programming standard, tailored for numerical astrophysics on Exascale architectures. The core of Shamrock is an accelerated parallel tree with negligible construction time, whose efficiency is based on binary algebra. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics algorithm of the Phantom code is implemented in Shamrock. On-the-fly tree construction circumvents the necessity for extensive data communications. In tests displaying a uniform density with global timesteping with tens of billions of particles, Shamrock completes a single time step in a few seconds using over the thousand of GPUs of a super-computer. This corresponds to processing billions of particles per second, with tens of millions of particles per GPU. The parallel efficiency across the entire cluster is larger than $\sim 90\%$.
#### R-JET: A postprocessing code for radiative transport in relativistic jets

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09992

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09992

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a post-processing radiative transport code for computing the spectra, the coreshift, and the surface-brightness distribution of special relativistic jets with arbitrary optical thickness. The jet consists of an electron-positron pair plasma and an electron-proton normal plasma. Electrons and positrons are relativistic and composed of thermal and nonthermal components, while protons are non-relativistic and non-radiating. The fraction of a pair plasma, as well as the fraction of a nonthermal component can be arbitrarily chosen. Only the synchrotron process is considered for emission and absorption when the radiative-transfer equation is integrated along our lines of sight. We describe a suite of test problems, and confirm the frequency dependence of the coreshift in the Konigl jet model, when the plasma is composed of nonthermal component alone. Finally, we illustrate the capabilities of the code with model calculations, demonstrating that the jet will exhibit a limb-brightened structure in general when it is energized by the rotational energy of the black hole. It is also demonstrated that such limb-brightened jets show a ring-like structure in the brightness map when we observe the jet launching region nearly face-on.
#### Modelling subsonic turbulence with SPH-EXA

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10273

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10273

 - **Abstract**
 The numerical simulation of subsonic turbulence with SPH has traditionally been hindered by E0 errors, inaccurate gradient evaluations, and excessive dissipation. In this work, we present numerical results of SPH simulations of subsonic turbulence and compare to state-of-the-art codes such as AREPO and GIZMO. For the first time, SPH can reproduce the results of such codes, showing a similar interval of wavenumber in the inertial range of the Kolmogorov cascade in the subsonic regime. We use the SPH-EXA code to perform these simulations, a GPU-based state-of-the-art SPH code with high performance and extreme scalability at its core. SPH-EXA is coupled with a modern SPH solver based on methods such as an integral approach to gradient calculation, artificial viscosity switches that include a linear field cleaner, a flexible family of pairing-resistant interpolation kernels, generalized volume elements, and a controlled handling of density jumps which maximizes Lagrangian compatibility. In addition, it includes a novel and extremely scalable gravity solver for astrophysical applications.
#### Beyond monoculture: polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics I. Examining properties of the exponential distribution

 - **Abstract**
 Observational data provided by JWST instruments continue to challenge theories and models of cloud formation in sub-stellar atmospheres, requiring more sophisticated approaches in an effort to understand their spatial complexity. However, to date, most cloud microphysical models using the moment method for sub-stellar atmospheres have assumed a monodisperse size distribution, neglecting polydisperse properties. We aim to extend beyond the common assumption of a monodisperse size distribution and analyse cloud microphysical processes assuming an exponential distribution. We derive expressions for the zeroth and first moments of condensation/evaporation and collisional growth processes under the assumption of an exponential size distribution. We then compare the differences between monodisperse and exponential distribution microphysics using a simple one-dimensional (1D) column model applied to a Y-dwarf KCl cloud scenario. We find that adopting an exponential distribution modifies condensation/evaporation rates by a factor of $\approx$0.9 and collisional growth rates by factors of $\approx$1.1 (Kn $\ll$ 1) and $\approx$0.92 (Kn $\gg$ 1) for Brownian coagulation and $\approx$0.85 for gravitational coalescence, compared to the monodisperse case. In our specific test cases, we find relative differences of a maximum 10-12% in total number density and 2-3% in mean radius of the cloud particles between the monodisperse and exponential distributions. Our results offer a simple way to take into account an assumed exponential size distribution for sub-stellar atmospheric cloud microphysics using the two-moment method. In follow up studies, we will examine more complex distributions, such as the log-normal and gamma distributions, that require more than two moments to characterise self-consistently.
#### Simulating the shaping of point-symmetric structures in the jittering jets explosion mechanism

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10326

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of core-collapse supernovae by launching several pairs of jets into a collapsing core model and show that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) can form a point-symmetric morphology that accounts for observed morphologies of many core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) remnants. Point-symmetric morphologies are composed of pairs of opposite structures around the center of the CCSN remnant. In the JJEM, the newly born neutron star launches several to a few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions, and these jets explode the star. In the simulations with the FLASH numerical code, we launch pairs of jets with varying directions, energies, opening angles, and durations into the massive stellar core and follow their evolution for about two seconds. We show that the jets form pairs of opposite filaments, clumps, bubbles, and lobes, namely, prominent point-symmetric morphologies. The interaction of the jets with the core leads to vigorous Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and excites many vortices, which also shape clumps and filaments. Our results strengthen the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.
#### 3D non-LTE Ca II line formation in metal-poor FGK stars. I. Abundance corrections, radial velocity corrections, and synthetic spectra
 - **Authors:** Cis Lagae, Anish M. Amarsi, Karin Lind
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10378

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10378

 - **Abstract**
 The Ca II resonance doublet (HK) and the near-infrared triplet (CaT) are among the strongest features in stellar spectra of FGK-type stars. These spectral lines remain prominent down to extremely low metallicities and are thus useful for providing stellar parameters via ionisation balance and as radial velocity diagnostics. However, the majority of studies that model these lines in late-type stars still rely on one dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres and the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We present 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations of the CaT and HK lines in an extended grid of 3D model atmospheres of metal-poor FGK-type. We investigate the impact of 3D non-LTE effects on abundances, line bisectors and radial velocities. We used a subset of 3D model atmospheres from the recently published STAGGER-grid to synthesize spectra in 3D (non-)LTE. For comparison, similar calculations were performed in 1D (non-)LTE using models from the MARCS grid. Abundance corrections for the CaT lines relative to 1D LTE range from +0.1 to -1.0 dex, with more severe corrections for strong lines in giants. With fixed line strength, the abundance corrections become more negative with increasing effective temperature and decreasing surface gravity. Radial velocity corrections relative to 1D LTE based on cross-correlation of the whole line profile range from -0.2 km/s to +1.5 km/s, with more severe corrections where the CaT lines are strongest. The corrections are even more severe if the line core alone is used to infer the radial velocity. The line strengths and shapes, and consequently the abundance and radial velocity corrections, are strongly affected by the chosen radiative transfer assumption, 1/3D (non)-LTE. We release grids of theoretical spectra that can be used to improve the accuracy of stellar spectroscopic analyses based on the Ca II triplet lines.
#### Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS). VII. Circumstellar gas kinematics traced by water masers inside the HC HII region NGC7538 IRS1

 - **Abstract**
 This article focuses on NGC7538 IRS1, one of the most luminous and studied HC HII regions in the northern hemisphere. Our aim is to identify the young stellar objects (YSOs) embedded within the ionized gas and study their kinematic structures. This work expands on a recent survey called "Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages" (POETS), which has been devoted to studying young outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au near luminous YSOs, before they start photoionizing the surrounding medium. We carried out multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array observations of the 22 GHz water masers toward NGC7538 IRS1 to measure the maser 3D velocities, which, following POETS' findings, are reliable tracers of the protostellar winds. Recently, we reobserved the water masers in NGC7538 IRS1 with sensitive global very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to map weaker maser emission. Our study confirms the presence of two embedded YSOs, IRS1a and IRS1b, at the center of the two linear distributions of 6.7 GHz methanol masers observed in the southern and northern cores of the HC HII region, which have been previously interpreted in terms of edge-on rotating disks. The water masers trace an extended (~200 au) stationary shock front adjacent to the inner portion of the disk around IRS1a. This shock front corresponds to the edge of the southern tip of the ionized core and might be produced by the interaction of the disk wind ejected from IRS1a with the infalling envelope. The water masers closer to IRS1b follow the same LSR velocity (Vlsr) pattern of the 6.7~GHz masers rotating in the disk, but the direction and amplitude of the water maser proper motions are inconsistent with rotation. We propose that these water masers are tracing a photo-evaporated disk wind, where the maser Vlsr traces mainly the disk rotation and the proper motions the poloidal velocity of the wind.
