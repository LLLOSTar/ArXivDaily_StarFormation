 - **Abstract**
 Gas cooling and heating rates are vital components of hydrodynamic simulations. However, they are computationally expensive to evaluate exactly with chemical networks or photoionization codes. We compare two different approximation schemes for gas cooling and heating in an idealized simulation of an isolated galaxy. One approximation is based on a polynomial interpolation of a table of Cloudy calculations, as is commonly done in galaxy formation simulations. The other approximation scheme uses machine learning for the interpolation instead on an analytic function, with improved accuracy. We compare the temperature-density phase diagrams of gas from each simulation run to assess how much the two simulation runs differ. Gas in the simulation using the machine learning approximation is systematically hotter for low-density gas with $-3 \lesssim \log{(n_b/\mathrm{cm}^{-3})} \lesssim -1$. We find a critical curve in the phase diagram where the two simulations have equal amounts of gas. The phase diagrams differ most strongly at temperatures just above and below this critical curve. We compare CII emission rates for collisions with various particles (integrated over the gas distribution function), and find slight differences between the two simulations. Future comparisons with simulations including radiative transfer will be necessary to compare observable quantities like the total CII luminosity.
#### Observational Signatures of Disk Winds in Protoplanetary Disks: Differentiating Magnetized and Photoevaporative Outflows With Fully Coupled Thermochemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetized winds and photoevaporative winds are critical in shaping protoplanetary disk evolution. Using 2D axisymmetric (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations with Athena++ implementing fully coupled thermochemistry, we investigate the signatures of the two winds in CO and [C~I] ALMA observations, and examine the potential to distinguish the origins. Our simulations reveal fundamental differences between the two winds: magnetized winds are colder and denser, exhibiting super-Keplerian rotation with small poloidal velocities of $\lesssim 1~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ in the atmosphere ($z/R\gtrsim0.45$), while photoevaporative winds are hotter and less dense, exhibiting sub-Keplerian rotation with higher poloidal velocity of several ${\rm km~s}^{-1}$. In addition to previously identified factors like thermal pressure gradient and disk's self-gravity, we demonstrate that magnetic tension/pressure and advection significantly influence rotational velocities of the gas in the wind, which lead to emission patterns that are distinct from Keplerian rotation in synthetic ALMA observations. Magnetized winds are visible in CO channel maps when wind loss rates are $\gtrsim10^{-8}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. When wind loss rates are lower, magnetized winds produce subtle perturbations in channel maps, which resemble the so-called ``velocity kinks'' produced by protoplanets. While photoevaporative winds dissociate CO through strong XUV radiation and thus are weaker in CO, they can create observable ring-like substructures. [C~I] emission is optically thin and could be most effective at detecting both winds in disks with high gas mass and/or high [C~I] abundance. Due to the spatially extended nature of the winds, using a large beam ($\simeq0.4$" for disks in nearby star-forming regions) will be helpful regardless of the tracer used.
#### Cosmology with Persistent Homology: Parameter Inference via Machine Learning

 - **Abstract**
 Building upon [2308.02636], this article investigates the potential constraining power of persistent homology for cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes in a likelihood-free inference pipeline. We evaluate the ability of persistence images (PIs) to infer parameters, compared to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS), and we compare two types of models: neural-based, and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS when the parameters can be constrained (i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$). PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, showing the promise of persistent homology in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results show that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little extra or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ uses the filaments (1-cycles) in addition to the other two types of topological features.
#### Spin evolution and mass distribution of the Galactic Binary Neutron Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.
#### Black Holes as Condensation Points of Fuzzy Dark Matter Cores

 - **Abstract**
 We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. We show that in general the BH merges with pre-collapsed mini-clusters and once they share location the BH oscillates within the core. The condensation takes place around the black hole and the FDM acquires a density profile consistent with the density of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem in average. The central density of the resulting core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its motion relative to the FDM cloud produces a smaller time-averaged densities for bigger BH masses, which lead to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. Our results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.
#### Radio filaments as Z-pinched Galactic center wind

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15575

 - **Abstract**
 In this brief note, we tentatively investigate the possibility that the radio filaments are produced when the Galactic center wind washes over magnetic field structures. The electrons and ions, with their disparate charge-to-mass ratios, are deflected differently by the magnetic field, and a current results. The current is subsequently Z-pinched into filaments, creating an electron-accelerating electric field along the way, because the magnetic field necessarily rearranges during the dynamic constriction process. An axial magnetic field also arises, possibly via the diocotron channel, to eventually quench the pinching and stabilize the filaments against a variety of instabilities.
#### Cellular Dynamics of Herium-rich Detonation on sub-Chandrasekhar Mass White Dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 Most previous efforts for hydrodynamic studies on detonation in the context of Type Ia supernovae did not take into account the scale of the cellular structure for a criterion in initiation, propagation, quenching, and the resolution requirement of detonation, whereas it is quite common to consider cell sizes in the discussion on terrestrial detonation in chemically reactive systems. In our recent study, the terrestrial cell-based theories, which incorporates the cell-size data acquired in 2D simulations of helium detonation in the double-detonation model, were demonstrated to be a powerful diagnostics in reproducing the thresholds in the initiation and quenching provided by previous studies. In the present study, 2D simulation results of the cellular detonation in the base of white-dwarf (WD) envelope are described in detail, in terms of the dynamic wave morphology and chemical abundance structure. The cellular structure is observed at a range of upstream density and envelope composition explored in the present work. C/O contamination by the WD core material reduces the cell width rapidly, as accelerated by the {\alpha}-capture reaction. It is also indicated that nickel production could be significantly delayed for the C/O-rich composition. The small cell width makes it extremely demanding to resolve the detonation structure in full-star simulations of SNe Ia; this could raise a concern on the robustness of the outcomes of some numerical simulations in terms of the success and failure of detonation. This issue may be overcome by sub-grid modeling that incorporates the cellular dynamics acquired in resolved simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Galactic ASKAP collaboration (GASKAP) is undertaking an HI emission survey of the 21cm line to map the Magellanic system and the Galactic plane with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). One of the first areas observed in the Pilot Phase I of the survey was the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous surveys of the SMC have uncovered new structures in the periphery of the SMC, along relatively low column density lines of sight. Aims. In this work we aimed to uncover the phase distribution of three distinct structures in the periphery of the SMC. This work will add to the constraints we have on the existence and survival of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in the SMC. Methods. We used ROHSA, a Gaussian decomposition algorithm, to model the emission across each cloud and classify the HI emission into their respective phases based on the linewidths of the fitted Gaussians. We created maps of velocity and column density of each phase of the HI across these three clouds. We measured the HI mass and CNM number density for each cloud. We also compared the HI results across the different phases with other gas tracers. Results. We find that in two clouds, the ends of each cloud are almost completely CNM dominated. Analysis of these two clouds indicates they are experiencing a compressive force from the direction of the SMC main body. In the third cloud we find a uniform CNM distribution along one wall of what is likely a supershell structure. Comparison with previous measurements of CO clumps in two of the clouds show the CO and HI are co-moving within a few km/s in regions of high HI column density, particularly when considering just the CNM.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of initial fractal clusters at 3 kpc from the Galactic Center (GC) of the Milky Way and show how red supergiant clusters (RSGCs)-like objects, which are considered to be the result of active star formation in the Scutum complex, can form by 16 Myr. We find that initial tidal filling and tidal over-filling fractals are shredded by the tidal force, but some substructures can survive as individual subclusters, especially when the initial virial ratio is $\leq$this http URL surviving subclusters are weakly mass segregated and show a top-heavy mass function. This implies the possibility that a single substructured star cluster can evolve into multiple `star clusters'.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae constitute a unique laboratory for particle physics and astrophysics. They are powerful neutrino sources of all flavors, emitting essentially all the gravitational binding energy through neutrinos, at the end of their life. I will highlight how crucial is the observation of the next core-collapse supernova and of the diffuse supernova neutrino background, whose discovery might be imminent.
