 - **Abstract**
 The late-stage evolution of massive stars is marked by intense instability as they approach core-collapse. During these phases, giant stellar eruptions lead to exceptionally high mass-loss rates, forming significant amounts of dust. However, the survival of these dust grains is challenged by the powerful shock waves generated when the progenitor explodes as a supernova (SN). We explore the impact of hydrogen-rich SN explosions from 45, 50, and 60 M$_\odot$ progenitors on dust formed after these eruptions, focusing on interactions with circumstellar shells occurring from a few years to centuries after the event. Using 3D hydrodynamical simulations, we track the evolution of dust particles in a scenario that includes the progenitor's stellar wind, a giant eruption, and the subsequent SN explosion, following the mass budgets predicted by stellar evolution models. For a standard SN ejecta mass of 10 M$_\odot$ and kinetic energy of $10^{51}$ erg, only 25% of the dust mass survives 250 years post-explosion in a spherical circumstellar medium (CSM), while merely 2% remains a century after the explosion in a bipolar CSM. If the SN follows the eruption within a dozen years, 75% of the dust survives for a standard explosion, dropping to 20% for more massive ejecta (15-20 M$_\odot$) with kinetic energy of $5 \times 10^{51}$ erg. The geometry of the CSM and the early transition of the SN remnant into a radiative phase significantly influence dust survival. As the shock wave weakens and efficiently converts kinetic energy into thermal radiation (up to half of the injected kinetic energy) the likelihood of dust survival increases, affecting not only pre-existing dust in the CSM but also SN-condensed dust and ambient interstellar dust. Contrary to expectations, a larger fraction of the dust mass can survive if the SN occurs only a few years after the eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the impact of CaII 3934,3969 and NaI 5891,5897 absorption arising in the interstellar medium (ISM) on the SDSS-IV MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar) and produce corrected spectroscopy for 80% of the 24,162-star catalog. We model the absorption strength of these transitions as a function of stellar distance, Galactic latitude, and dust reddening based upon high-spectral resolution studies. With this model, we identify 6342 MaStar stars that have negligible ISM absorption ($W^\mathrm{ISM}$(CaII K) $<0.07$ Ang and $W^\mathrm{ISM}$(NaI 5891) $<0.05$ Ang). For 12,110 of the remaining stars, we replace their NaI D profile (and their CaII profile for effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}>9000$ K) with a coadded spectrum of low-ISM stars with similar $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity, and metallicity. For 738 additional stars with $T_{\rm eff}>9000$ K, we replace these spectral regions with a matching ATLAS9-based BOSZ model. This results in a mean reduction in $W$(CaII K) ($W$(NaI D)) of $0.4-0.7$ Ang ($0.6-1.1$ Ang) for hot stars ($T_{\rm eff}>7610$ K), and a mean reduction in $W$(NaI D) of $0.1-0.2$ Ang for cooler stars. We show that interstellar absorption in simple stellar population (SSP) model spectra constructed from the original library artificially enhances $W$(CaII K) by $\gtrsim20\%$ at young ages ($<400$ Myr); dramatically enhances the strength of stellar NaI D in starbursting systems (by ${\gtrsim}50\%$); and enhances stellar NaI D in older stellar populations (${\gtrsim}10$ Gyr) by ${\gtrsim}10\%$. We provide SSP spectra constructed from the cleaned library, and discuss the implications of these effects for stellar population synthesis analyses constraining stellar age, [Na/Fe] abundance, and the initial mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of 15 X-ray observations of Mrk 477, a nearby Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, with the objective to monitor its obscuring column density variability. The full dataset consists of five archival observations, split into two XMM-Newton, two NuSTAR and one Chandra observation, plus two dedicated monitoring campaigns. The monitoring campaigns were performed with Swift-XRT and NuSTAR, containing five observations each. We performed a simultaneous analysis using self-consistent torus models, deriving geometric properties of the torus as well as the obscuration along the line of sight. Mrk 477 is best modeled with a torus with large covering factor yet low column density (on average). Its line of sight column density oscillates between $1.5-7\times10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$. Mrk~477 presents frequent obscuring column density variability, on timescales as short as $\sim2$~weeks. The probability of drawing a pair of obscuration-variable observations for Mrk~477 when having 2, 3, and 4 observations is 40\%, 78\% and 95\%, respectively. Adding the results of this work to those of another 26 sources, we find a trend of increasing obscuration variability with time (from $\sim20$\% at $\Delta t<10$~days, to $\sim60-70$\% at timescales larger than 5 years). We discuss whether this is compatible with the majority of obscuration variability coming from broad line region clouds.
#### ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data

 - **Abstract**
 We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrochemical models of interstellar clouds, the sites of stars, and planet formation require information about spin-state chemistry to allow quantitative comparison with spectroscopic observations. In particular, it is important to know if full scrambling or H abstraction (also known as proton hopping) takes place in ion-neutral reactions. The reaction of Cl+ and HCl+ with H2 and isotopologues has been studied at cryogenic temperatures between 20 and 180 K using a 22 pole radio frequency ion trap. Isotopic exchange processes are used to probe the reaction mechanism of the HCl+ + H2 reaction. The results are compared with previous measurements and theoretical predictions. The rate coefficients for the Cl+ + H2 and HCl+ + H2 reactions are found to be constant in the range of temperatures studied, except for the DCl+ + D2 reaction, where a weak negative temperature dependence is observed, and reactions with D2 are found to be significantly slower than the Langevin rate. No isotopic exchange reactions are observed to occur for the H2Cl+ ion. The analysis of the products of the HCl+ + H2 isotopic system clearly indicates that the reaction proceeds via simple hydrogen atom abstraction.

 - **Abstract**
 There is now a large sample of stars observed by the Kepler satellite with measured rotation periods and photometric activity index $S_{\rm ph}$. We use this data, in conjunction with stellar interiors models, to explore the interplay of magnetism, rotation, and convection. Stellar activity proxies other than $S_{\rm ph}$ are correlated with the Rossby number, $Ro$, or ratio of rotation period to convective overturn timescale. We compute the latter using the Yale Rotating Evolution Code stellar models. We observe different $S_{\rm ph}$-$Ro$ relationships for different stellar spectral types. Though the overall trend of decreasing magnetic activity versus $Ro$ is recovered, we find a localized dip in $S_{\rm ph}$ around $Ro/Ro_{\odot} \sim$\,0.3 for the G and K dwarfs. F dwarfs show little to no dependence of $S_{\rm ph}$ on $Ro$ due to their shallow convective zones; further accentuated as $T_{\rm eff}$ increases. The dip in activity for the G and K dwarfs corresponds to the intermediate rotation period gap, suggesting that the dip in $S_{\rm ph}$ could be associated with the redistribution of angular momentum between the core and convective envelope inside stars. For G-type stars, we observe enhanced magnetic activity above solar $Ro$. Compared to other Sun-like stars with similar effective temperature and metallicity, we find that the Sun's current level of magnetic activity is comparable to its peers and lies near the transition to increasing magnetic activity at high $Ro$. We confirm that metal-rich stars have a systematically larger $S_{\rm ph}$ level than metal-poor stars, which is likely a consequence of their deeper convective zones.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) JWST observations have measured the ice composition toward two highly-extinguished field stars in the Chamaeleon I cloud. The observed extinction excess on the long-wavelength side of the H2O ice band at 3 micron has been attributed to a mixture of CH3OH with ammonia hydrates, which suggests that CH3OH ice could have formed in a water-rich environment with little CO depletion. Laboratory experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that CH3OH could form via the grain surface reactions CH3+OH and/or C+H2O in water-rich ices. However, no dedicated chemical modelling has been carried out thus far to test their efficiency and dependence on the astrochemical code employed. We model the ice chemistry in the Chamaeleon I cloud using a set of astrochemical codes (MAGICKAL, MONACO, Nautilus, UCLCHEM, and KMC simulations) to test the effects of the different code architectures and of the assumed ice chemistry. Our models show that the JWST ice observations are better reproduced for gas densities >1e5 cm-3 and collapse times >1e5 yr. CH3OH ice forms predominantly (>99%) via CO hydrogenation. The contribution of reactions CH3+OH and C+H2O, is negligible. The CO2 ice may form either via CO+OH or CO+O depending on the code. However, KMC simulations reveal that both mechanisms are efficient despite the low rate constant of the CO+O surface reaction. CH4 is largely underproduced for all codes except for UCLCHEM, for which a higher amount of atomic C is available during the initial translucent cloud phase. Large differences in the ice abundances are found at Tdust<12 K between diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry codes. This is due to the fact that non-diffusive chemistry takes over diffusive chemistry at such low Tdust. This could explain the rather constant ice chemical composition found in Chamaeleon I and other dense cores despite the different visual extinctions probed.
#### A primordial radius valley as a consequence of planet formation

 - **Abstract**
 The radius distribution of close-in planets has been observed to have a bimodal distribution with a dearth of planets around ~1.5-2.0 $R_\oplus$ commonly referred to as the ''radius valley''. The origin of the valley is normally attributed to mass-loss process such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Recent work, however, has suggested that the radius valley may instead arise as a consequence of gas accretion by low-mass planets. In this work we therefore aim to investigate the formation of a primordial radius valley from the formation of planet cores through pebble accretion up until the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc and subsequent contraction of accreted atmospheres. The goal of this work is to explore the conditions for forming a primordial radius valley from first principles of planet formation theory, rather than attempting to explain the detailed structure of the observed valley. We use an analytical model with minimal assumptions to estimate the contraction rate of atmospheres and, indeed, find the formation of a primordial radius valley. The planets smaller than the valley did not reach the pebble isolation mass, which is required for the planets to cool down sufficiently to be able to accrete a significant amount of gas. We also estimate the slopes of the radius gap as a function of orbital period for the intrinsic population as well as for planets with orbital periods <100 days. For the intrinsic population, the radius gap follows the pebble isolation mass and increases with increasing orbital period, while for close-in planets the direction of the slope reverses and decreases with increasing orbital period. We find that planets smaller than the radius valley are predominantly rocky while the population of planets larger than the valley consists of a mixture of rocky and water-rich planets.
