 - **Abstract**
 We report our discovery of a faint nebula surrounding a previously little-studied 15th-mag variable star, ASASSN-19ds, in the southern-hemisphere constellation Antlia. Spectra verify that the star is a cataclysmic variable (CV). Using new and archival photometry, we confirm that ASASSN-19ds is an eclipsing binary with an orbital period of 0.139 days (3.34 hr). Moreover, its out-of-eclipse brightness shows a "sawtooth" light curve with an amplitude of $\sim$1~mag and an interval between peaks that varies between about three to nearly five weeks. Its mean absolute magnitude in the Gaia system is $M_G=+6.5$. These combined properties lead to a classification of ASASSN-19ds as a Z Camelopardalis-type CV. We obtained deep narrow-band images of the nebulosity, using modest-sized telescopes and extremely long exposure times. Our imagery reveals a bipolar morphology, with thin arcs at the ends of the major axis, likely indicating an interaction with the interstellar medium. We consider several scenarios for the origin of the nebula, but from the existing information we are unable to distinguish between it being ejecta from an unobserved classical-nova outburst several centuries ago, or an ancient planetary nebula. Future observations should be able to decide between these possibilities. At the star's distance of only $\sim$557 pc, a nova eruption would have been a spectacular naked-eye event.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the CS (J=2-1) line cube from the internal data release obtained by the large-scale program "ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES)" to investigate the kinematic structure of the innermost $\sim 10$ pc region of the Galaxy, which contains the high-velocity compact cloud (HVCC) at $(l,b,v_{\rm lsr})\sim(+0^\circ.02,-0^\circ.02, 100 {\rm km~s}^{-1})$ (hereafter G0.02). The longitude-velocity diagram (LVD) of the cloud draws an elliptical structure, which is interpreted as an orbital trajectory in the $(l,V_{\rm lsr})$ space of a noncircular (eccentric) motion of the molecular gas in the gravitational potential of an extended mass distribution in the central 10 pc of the Galaxy. We argue that G0.02 is a kinematic tracer of the inner potential, a rare case of a dense gas following an eccentric orbit in the nuclear gravitational field.
#### Hydroxylated Mg-rich amorphous silicates as catalysts for molecular hydrogen formation in the interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from an experimental study on the interaction of atomic deuterium with Mg-rich amorphous enstatite and forsterite type silicates. Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the process. During D atom exposure, deuteroxyl group formation was observed. The cross section for OD group formation, estimated from the OD stretching band intensity with D atom fluence, is 4.2.10^{-18} cm^2 for both silicates. HD (D2) molecules form via D atom abstraction of chemisorbed H(D) atoms from OH (OD) groups, with a cross section of 7.0.10^{-18} cm^2. Quantum chemical calculations on enstatite and forsterite amorphous nano-clusters were used to analyze chemisorption and abstraction energies of H atoms. The formation of OH groups on forsterite is barrierless, while enstatite has a small energy barrier. H2 abstraction from hydroxyl groups is barrierless in both silicates. The results support our interpretation of IR spectral changes during D atom exposure as addition and exchange reactions, with catalytic molecular deuterium formation. These findings, obtained at 300 K, are relevant to astrophysical environments like photodissociation regions and interstellar clouds at lower temperatures. Amorphous silicates, like carbon grains, undergo hydrogenation in the diffuse interstellar medium due to interactions with atomic hydrogen and UV photons. The detection of these components on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko connects primitive solar system objects to interstellar dust, offering new insights into their evolution.
#### Multivariate Time-series Transformer Embeddings for Light Curves

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical surveys produce time-series data by observing stellar objects across multiple wavelength bands. Foundational transformer-based models, such as Astromer, encode each time-series as a sequence of embeddings of uniform dimensions. However, such models operate independently on each band at a single time and do not natively leverage information across telescope filters. We extend this framework by introducing a fusion mechanism that maps the collection of single-band embeddings to a unified sequence representation, enabling multiband modeling for downstream tasks. The challenge lies in devising a mechanism within the encoder to coordinate between data from different wavelengths, which are often recorded at asynchronous times. We pre-train multiband models on a subset of 600000 high signal-to-noise light curves from the MACHO survey and fine-tune them using the Alcock and ATLAS survey datasets. Experimental results show that both our proposed multiband architectures outperform the single-band models by approximately 10% in F1-score, with jointly pre-trained multiband encoders further improving performance over a collection of independently pre-trained single-band encoders. Furthermore, our experiments show that there are minimal differences in multiband performance when sampling individual band data asynchronously versus sampling all individual bands on the same set of time-steps. However, jointly pre-trained models can take more than twice the time to pre-train. These results demonstrate the trade-offs of the multiband approach where multivariate data are available.
#### Comparing the Space Densities of Millisecond-Spin Magnetars and Fast X-Ray Transients

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are bright X-ray flashes with durations of minutes to hours, peak isotropic luminosities of L_X,peak ~ 10^42-10^47 erg/s, and total isotropic energies of E ~ 10^47-10^50 erg. They have been detected in the soft X-ray band by Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, and, most recently, by Einstein Probe, which has reported more than 50 FXTs in its first year of operation. While several models have been proposed, the nature of many FXTs remains unknown. One model suggests FXTs are powered by the spin-down of newly formed millisecond magnetars, typically produced by binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. However, the BNS volumetric rate, ~10^2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1, barely overlaps with the estimated FXT rate of 10^3-10^4 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Even within that overlap, BNS mergers would need to produce FXTs at nearly 100% efficiency. We explore whether other millisecond magnetar formation channels could account for this discrepancy. We compile rate densities for several proposed progenitors: accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, binary white dwarf mergers, neutron star-white dwarf mergers, and the collapse of massive stars, and convert Galactic event rates into volumetric rates using either the star formation rate or the stellar mass density distributions as a function of redshift. We find that the highest potential formation rates arise from binary white dwarf mergers and massive star collapses. However, both channels face theoretical and observational challenges: the spin and magnetic field properties of the resulting neutron stars are uncertain, and few are expected to satisfy both conditions required for FXT production. Across all scenarios, the fraction of suitable millisecond magnetars is low or poorly constrained. We conclude that they are unlikely to be the dominant progenitors of FXTs and can contribute to at most 10% of the observed FXT population.
#### The Diversity of Exoplanetary Environments and the Search for Signs of Life Beyond Earth

 - **Abstract**
 Thousands of exoplanets orbit nearby stars, showcasing a remarkable diversity in mass, size, and orbits. With the James Webb Space Telescope now operational, we are observing exoplanet atmospheres and aiming to reach down to small, habitable-zone exoplanets in search of signs of habitability and possibly even biosignature gases. Given the scarcity of targets, it is imperative to embrace the known diversity and consider the range of exoplanets that might host life. We review how Earth life interacts with various atmospheric gases, noting that bacteria can survive in high concentrations of gases such as H2, He, CO2, and CO. Additionally, we consider the potential for life in alternative solvents and in cloud biospheres where rocky surfaces are excessively hot, as well as in hypothesized planetary global oceans. We highlight that life fundamentally requires metal ions for catalytic reactions, suggesting that environments without surface contact need meteoritic delivery to provide these essential elements. Despite today's observational limits, a suite of next-generation telescopes is being designed specifically for exoplanet studies, promising to expand our capabilities and understanding in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present polarization images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant {Metrewave} Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 5.5, 10 GHz and 663 MHz of the changing-look (CL) AGN, NGC3516. A transverse gradient in the rotation measure (RM) is detected in the northern and southern kpc-scale lobes. Such gradients have typically been suggested to be signatures of a helical magnetic (B-) field. We detect circular polarization in the core and inner jet-knot of this source which is known to host a precessing radio jet interacting with emission-line gas. Soft X-ray emission from the Chandra X-ray Observatory suggests the presence of a hot wind emerging from the nucleus of NGC3516. Taken together with the RM gradient, this presents a picture of jet+wind outflow in this Seyfert galaxy with the B-field confining both the jet and lobe emission. A magnetically driven outflow may in turn cause accretion disk warping and jet precession which is observed in the case of NGC3516.
