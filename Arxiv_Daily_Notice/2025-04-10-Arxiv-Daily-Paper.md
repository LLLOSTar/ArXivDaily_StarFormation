 - **Abstract**
 We present a new, Bayesian analysis of the highest-resolution optical spectrum of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary candidate PG 1302-102, obtained with ESPRESSO@VLT (R \simeq 138, 000). Our methodology, based on robust Bayesian model selection, reveals the presence of multiple narrow emission lines at the expected redshift of the source and confirms (for H\{beta}) and detects (for H{\gamma}) the presence of redshifted broad components. Additionally, we have discovered a very broad and, if it is associated with the H\{beta}, very redshifted component at {\lambda} \simeq 5000Å. We evaluate two scenarios for explaining the observed broad emission line (BEL) in PG 1302-102. In the case in which the redshifted BEL asymmetry arises from the orbital motion of a putative binary, our measurements coupled with simple estimates of the broad-line region (BLR) sizes suggest that the individual black hole BLRs are either settled in a single BLR or in the process of merging and, therefore truncated and highly disturbed. Alternatively, in the scenario of a single SMBH, we explain the distorted emission of the BELs with a nonsymmetric distribution of the BLR clouds; namely, a thin disk with a spiral perturbation. This BLR configuration is statistically preferred over any empirical multi-Gaussian fit and simultaneously explains the asymmetric emission of the H{\beta} and H{\gamma} close to the bulk of the line and any additional excess (or the lack of it, in the case of the H{\gamma}) at much longer wavelengths. The physical origins of the perturbation are unclear, and a connection with the possible presence of a black hole binary cannot be ruled out. Given the growing evidence from theoretical and observational works demonstrating the common presence of disturbed BLRs in active galactic nuclei, we argue that an origin related to self-gravitating instabilities may be more plausible.

 - **Abstract**
 A plethora of evidence suggests that $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the nuclear star cluster of a galaxy that merged with the Milky Way in early times. We use APOGEE, Gaia, MUSE, and HST data supplemented by galaxy chemical evolution models to place constraints on the assembly and chemical enrichment history of $\omega$ Cen. The APOGEE data reveal three stellar populations occupying separate loci on canonical chemical planes. One population resembles metal-poor halo field stars (P1), a second shows light-element abundance anti-correlations typical of metal-poor globular clusters (IM), and a third population (P2) is characterised by an extreme "second-generation" abundance pattern. Both P1 and P2 populations cover a broad range of metallicity, consistent with extended histories of bursty star formation (SF), which is also evident from their light- and $\alpha$-element abundance patterns. Conversely, the IM stars exhibit a narrow metallicity spread, combined with the Al-Mg, Na-O, and C-N anti-correlations common to metal-poor Galactic globular clusters. Moreover, these three populations alone seem to account for the distribution of $\omega$ Cen stars in the chromosome map. We discuss these findings in context of a scenario according to which $\omega$ Cen formed by a combination of in situ SF within the host galaxy (P1), followed by the spiralling in of gas-rich globular clusters (IM), leading to another burst of SF (P2). We perform a robust comparison of the chemical composition of $\omega$ Cen with those of halo substructures well represented in APOGEE DR17, finding no chemical associations to a high confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic open clusters (OCs) are subject to internal and external destructive effects that gradually deplete their stellar content, leaving imprints on their structure. To investigate their dynamical state from an observational perspective, we employed Gaia DR3 data to perform a comprehensive analysis of 174 OCs (~10% of Dias et al.'s 2021 catalogue). We employed radial density profiles and astrometrically decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams to derive structural parameters, distance, mass and time-related quantities. We explored the parameters space and searched for connections relating the clusters' structure with the internal evolutionary state and the external Galactic tidal field. Correlations were verified after segregating the sample according to the Galactocentric distance and half-light to Jacobi radius ratio ($r_h/R_J$). This tidal filling ratio decreases with both the cluster mass and dynamical age. At a given evolutionary stage, OCs with larger $r_h/R_J$ tend to present larger fractions of mass loss due to dynamical effects. Regarding the impact of the external conditions, we identified different evaporation regimes: for ambient densities ($\rho_{\rm{amb}}$) larger than ~0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, clusters tend to be more tidally filled as they are subject to weaker tidal stresses. For $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$ $\lesssim$ 0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, the opposite occurs: $R_J$ increases for smaller $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$, causing $r_h/R_J$ to decrease. In turn, two-body relaxation tends to compact the cluster core, which is less sensitive to variations of the external potential. The higher the degree of central concentration, the larger the number of relaxation times a cluster takes until its dissolution.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents calculations of rate coefficients, resonance strengths, and cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) of Y^+, Sr^+, Te^2+, and Ce^2+--low-charge ions relevant to kilonovae and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) plasmas. Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we computed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments. Our results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at kilonova temperatures (~ 10^4 K) and regulating charge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances significantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-n Rydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels. Discrepancies with existing datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to minimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting spectroscopic observations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space Telescope data. We also put forward suitable candidates for experimental studies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measurements. The data presented here have potential to refine models of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma modeling in astrophysical and laboratory settings.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiscale studies of the morphology and strength of the magnetic field are crucial to properly unveil its role and relative importance in high-mass star and cluster formation. G31.41+0.31 (G31) is a hub-filament system that hosts a high-mass protocluster embedded in a hot molecular core (HMC). G31 is one of the few sources showing a clear hourglass morphology of the magnetic field on scales between 1000 au and a few 100 au in previous interferometric observations. This strongly suggests a field-regulated collapse. To complete the study of the magnetic field properties in this high-mass star-forming region, we carried out observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope $850 \mu$m of the polarized dust emission. These observations had a spatial resolution of $\sim$0.2 pc at 3.75 kpc. The aim was to study the magnetic field in the whole cloud and to compare the magnetic field orientation toward the HMC from $\sim$50,000 au to $\sim$260 au scales. The large-scale ($\sim$5 pc) orientation of the magnetic field toward the position of the HMC is consistent with that observed at the core ($\sim$4,000 au) and circumstellar ($\sim$260 au) scales. The self-similarity of the magnetic field orientation at these different scales might arise from the brightest sources in the protocluster, whose collapse is dragging the magnetic field. These sources dominate the gravitational potential and the collapse in the HMC. The cloud-scale magnetic field strength of the G31 hub-filament system, which we estimated using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is in the range 0.04--0.09 mG. The magnetic field orientation in the star-forming region shows a bimodal distribution, and it changes from an NW--SE direction in the north to an E--W direction in the south [abridged abstract].

 - **Abstract**
 Hot cores represent critical astrophysical environments for high-mass star formation, distinguished by their rich spectra of organic molecular emission lines. We aim to utilize high-angular resolution molecular line data from ALMA to identify hot cores, with a particular focus on weak-emission candidates, and to provide one of the largest samples of hot core candidates. We propose to use spectral stacking and imaging techniques of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ALMA-ATOMS survey, including line identification & weights, segmentation of line datacubes, resampling, stacking and normalization, moment 0 maps, and data analysis, to search for hot core candidates. We classify cores with dense emission of CH3OH and at least one molecule from the other six molecules as hot core candidates. In addition to the existing sample of 60 strong hot cores from the ALMA-ATOMS survey, we have detected 40 new weak candidates through stacking. All hot core candidates display compact emission from at least one of the other six COM species. For the strong sample, the stacking method provides molecular column density estimates that are consistent with previous fitting results. For the newly identified weak candidates, all species except CH3CHO show compact emission in the stacked image, which cannot be fully resolved spatially. These weak candidates exhibit column densities of COMs that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than those of the strong sample. The entire hot core sample, including the weak candidates, reveals tight correlations between the compact emission of CH3OH and other COM species, suggesting they may share a similar chemical environment for COMs, with CH3OH potentially acting as a precursor for other COMs. The molecular line stacking technique is used to identify hot core candidates in this work, leading to the identification of 40 new hot core candidates.
#### HIP 15429: a newborn Be star on an eccentric binary orbit

 - **Abstract**
 We identified a new post-interaction binary, HIP 15429, consisting of a stripped star and a recently formed, rapidly rotating Be star companion ($v \sin i \approx 270$ km/s) sharing many similarities with recently identified bloated stripped stars. From orbital fitting of multi-epoch radial velocities we find a 221-day period. We also find an eccentricity of $e=0.52$, which is unexpectedly high as tides are expected to have circularised the orbit efficiently during the presumed recent mass transfer. The formation of a circumbinary disk during the mass transfer phase or the presence of an unseen tertiary companion might explain the orbit's high eccentricity. We determined physical parameters for both stars by fitting the spectra of the disentangled binary components and multi-band photometry. The stripped nature of the donor star is affirmed by its high luminosity at a low inferred mass ($\lesssim 1 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) and imprints of CNO-processed material in the surface abundances. The donor's relatively large radius and cool temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 13.5 \pm 0.5$ kK) suggest that it has only recently ceased mass transfer. Evolutionary models assuming a 5-6 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ progenitor can reproduce these parameters and imply that the binary is currently evolving towards a stage where the donor becomes a subdwarf orbiting a Be star. The remarkably high eccentricity of HIP 15429 challenges standard tidal evolution models, suggesting either inefficient tidal dissipation or external influences, such as a tertiary companion or circumbinary disk. This underscores the need to identify and characterise more post-mass transfer binaries to benchmark and refine theoretical models of binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray synchrotron radiation is expected to be highly polarized. Thanks to the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), it is now possible to evaluate the degree of X-ray polarization in sources such as supernova remnants (SNRs). Jointly using IXPE data and high-resolution Chandra observations, we perform a spatially resolved spectropolarimetric analysis of SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We focus in the 3-6 keV energy band on regions near the shell dominated by nonthermal synchrotron emission. By combining IXPE's polarization sensitivity with Chandra's higher spatial and spectral resolution, we constrain the local polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) across the remnant. Our analysis reveals PD values ranging locally from 10% to 26%, showing significant regional variations that underscore the complex magnetic field morphology of Cas A. The polarization vectors indicate a predominantly radial magnetic field, consistent with previous studies. Thanks to the improved modeling of thermal contamination using Chandra data, we retrieve higher PD values compared to earlier IXPE analysis and more significant detections with respect to the standard IXPEOBSSIM analysis. Finally, we also estimate the degree of magnetic turbulence {\eta} from the measured photon index and PD, under the assumption of an isotropic fluctuating field across the shell of Cas A.

 - **Abstract**
 The winds of massive stars remove a significant fraction of their mass, strongly impacting their evolution. As a star evolves, the rate at which it loses mass changes. In stellar evolution codes, different mass-loss recipes are employed for different evolutionary stages. The choice of the recipes is user-dependent and the conditions for switching between them are poorly defined. Focusing on hot stars, we aim to produce a physically motivated, empirically calibrated mass-loss recipe suitable for a wide range of metallicities. We want to provide a ready-to-use universal recipe that eliminates the need for switching between recipes for hot stars during stellar evolution calculations. We compile a sample of hot stars with reliable stellar and wind parameters in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The sample is used to determine the dependence of the mass-loss rate on the basic stellar parameters. We find that independent of evolutionary stage and temperature, the wind mass-loss rate is a function of the electron-scattering Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and metallicity (Z), being in line with expectations of radiation-driven wind theory. Our derived scaling relation provides an adequate ($\Delta$log($\dot{M}$/(M$_\odot$/yr)) = 0.43) and broadly applicable mass-loss recipe for hot stars. The newly derived mass-loss recipe covers nearly the entire parameter space of hot stars with UV radiation-driven winds and eliminates the need for interpolation between mass-loss formulae at different evolutionary stages when applied in stellar evolution models. Examples of stellar evolution calculations using our new recipe reveal that the predictions on the ionizing fluxes and final fates of massive stars, especially at low metallicity, differ significantly from models that use the standard mass-loss rates, impacting our understanding of stellar populations at low metallicity and in the young Universe.
