#### Ambipolar diffusion and the mass-to-flux ratio in a turbulent collapsing cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of stars is governed by the intricate interplay of nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, gravity, and turbulence. Computational challenges have hindered a comprehensive 3D exploration of this interplay, posing a longstanding challenge in our understanding of clouds and cores. Our objective was to study the spatial features and time evolution of the neutral-ion drift velocity and the mass-to-flux ratio in a 3D nonideal MHD chemo-dynamical simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular cloud. The resistivities of the cloud were computed self-consistently from a vast non-equilibrium chemical network containing 115 species. To compute the resistivities we used different mean collisional rates for each charged species in our network. We additionally developed a new generalized method for measuring the true mass-to-flux ratio in 3D simulations. Despite the cloud's turbulent nature, at early times, the neutral-ion drift velocity follows the expected structure from 2D axisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with an hourglass magnetic field. At later times, however, the neutral-ion drift velocity becomes increasingly complex, with many vectors pointing outward from the cloud's center. Specifically, we find that the drift velocity above and below the cloud's ``midplane'' is in ``antiphase''. We explain these features on the basis of magnetic helical loops and the correlation of the drift velocity with the magnetic tension force per unit volume. Despite the complex structure of the neutral-ion drift velocity, we demonstrate that, when averaged over a region, the true mass-to-flux ratio monotonically increases as a function of time and decreases as a function of the radius from the center of the cloud. In contrast, the ``observed'' mass-to-flux ratio shows poor correlation with the true mass-to-flux ratio and the density structure of the cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Unraveling the multi-phase structure of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) is essential to understanding the lifecycle of the Milky Way. However, HI phase separation is a challenging and under-constrained problem. The neutral gas phase distribution is often inferred from the spectral line structure of HI emission. In this work, we develop a data-driven phase separation method that extracts HI phase structure solely from the spatial morphology of HI emission intensity structures. We combine scattering spectra (SS) statistics with a Gaussian-mixture variational autoencoder (VAE) model to: 1. derive an interpretable statistical model of different HI phases from their multi-scale morphological structures; 2. use this model to decompose the 2D channel maps of GALFA-HI emission in diffuse high latitude ($|b|>30$\degree) regions over narrow velocity channels ($\Delta v=3$ km/s) into cold neutral medium (CNM), warm neutral medium (WNM), and noise components. We integrate our CNM map over velocity channels to compare it to an existing map produced by a spectrum-based method, and find that the two maps are highly correlated, while ours recovers more spatially coherent structures at small scales. Our work illustrates and quantifies a clear physical connection between the HI morphology and HI phase structure, and unlocks a new avenue for improving future phase separation techniques by making use of both HI spectral and spatial information to decompose HI in 3D position-position-velocity (PPV) space. These results are consistent with a physical picture where processes that drive HI phase transitions also shape the morphology of HI gas, imprinting a sparse, filamentary CNM that forms out of a diffuse, extended WNM.

 - **Abstract**
 Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of helium escaping the atmosphere of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of atmospheric escape and exoplanetary evolution. Using high-precision spectroscopic observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRISS-SOSS mode, we report the detection of significant helium absorption during the pre-transit phase of WASP-107b (17$\sigma$), as well as in the transit and post-transit phases. This unique continuous helium absorption begins approximately 1.5 hours before the planet's ingress and reveals the presence of an extended thermosphere. The observations show a maximum transit depth of 2.395$\% \pm$ 0.01$\%$ near the helium triplet (36$\sigma$; at NIRISS-SOSS resolution $\sim$ 700). Our ellipsoidal model of the planetary thermosphere matches well the measured light curve suggesting an outflow extending to tens of planetary radii. Furthermore, we confidently detect water absorption (log10 H2O=-2.5 $\pm$ 0.6), superimposed with a short-wavelength slope which we attribute to a prominent signature from unocculted stellar spots (5.2$\sigma$), rather than a small-particle haze slope. We place an upper limit on the abundance of K (log10 K$<$-4.86, or K/H$<$ 75$\times$ stellar) at 2$\sigma$, which is consistent with the O/H super-solar metallicity estimate. This study underscores the transformative potential of JWST for tracing atmospheric and mass-loss processes, while offering a benchmark for future studies targeting helium escape and its implications for planetary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 < \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 < M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta > 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.
#### Proposal for the optical design of three robust and highly performing FPI systems for the European Solar Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a proposal for the optical design of three dual Fabry-Perot based narrowband filter systems for for the future European Solar Telescope (EST). These are intended to constitute the core elements of three imaging spectropolarimeters, foreseen to become amongst the most important science instruments for EST. The designs proposed here rely heavily on the heritage of CRISP and CHROMIS, developed for the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and described in detail in a companion paper (Scharmer et al. 2025, in prep.). The outstanding performance of these systems, and the simplicity of their designs, provide strong support of our proposal to build similar systems for EST. The design concepts involve i) minimising the FPI clear aperture diameter by means of numerical simulations based on constraints on Strehl and spectral resolution set by the EST Science Advisory Group (SAG); ii) a compact telecentric optical design with an optical path length of less than 4.7 m; iii) a straight-through optical system based on lenses and without any folding mirrors; iv) the combination of a high resolution etalon with high reflectivity and a low reflectivity, low resolution etalon, to mitigate the effects of cavity errors (Scharmer 2006, Scharmer et al. 2025); v) flexibility in terms of image scale by simple replacement of the last lens (the camera lens) of the FPI system. We propose to compensate for the focus curve of ESTs Pier Optical Path (POP) by focusing the camera lenses of the FPI systems. s. The proposed systems should offer several advantages over other much more complex systems, including manufacture, alignment, stability, flexibility of changes of image scale, and costs. The underlying design concepts also make the proposed FPI systems robust and highly performing in terms of image quality, overall transmission, and fidelity of the spectral transmission profile.
#### Effect of Magnetic Field on the Accretion Phase of Population III Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the impact of the magnetic field on Population III star formation by varying the magnetic field strength. We perform simulations with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{-20}$ G to $10^{-4}$ G, in addition to a model without a magnetic field. The simulations are run for $>1000-1400$ yr after the first protostar forms. In weak-field models, the surrounding disk fragments, forming multiple protostars, and the magnetic field is amplified by the orbital motion and rotation of these protostars. In the model without a magnetic field, frequent fragmentation occurs, and the most massive protostar reaches $\sim200 M_\odot$. However, in models with a magnetic field, once the magnetic field is amplified, the protostars merge to form a single massive protostar, and no further fragmentation occurs except in the model with the strongest magnetic field. Even after the formation of the single protostar, the magnetic field continues to amplify, leading to the formation of a thick disk supported by magnetic pressure and a global spiral pattern. In models with moderate or strong magnetic fields, a rotating disk can form, but fragmentation does not occur, and a strong magnetic field drives an outflow. However, the range of parameters for both disk formation and outflow driving is very narrow, making their appearance under realistic conditions unlikely. Given the weak magnetic field in the early universe, Population III stars are expected to form as single stars, surrounded by a thick disk with a spiral pattern. Thus, the magnetic field, regardless of its strength, plays a crucial role in Population III star formation.
#### The TYPHOON Stellar Population Synthesis Survey. II. Pushing Full Spectral Fitting to the Limit in the Nearby Grand Design Barred Spiral M83

 - **Abstract**
 We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra of the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square of 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through the analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates, ages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first time, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from full-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young stellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars, young massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of concordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The metallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial metallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with our chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is observed in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with circumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the circumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to AGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity with a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and molecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation between R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission strength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm our results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.
#### The mantle-inner core gravitational mode of oscillation in a strong magnetic field regime

 - **Abstract**
 The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfvén waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfvén waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfvén waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfvén waves.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent spectroscopic measurements have revealed absorption from higher rotational levels in C$_2$ than previous observations. These improvements are accompanied by the availability of updated radiative and collisional data. Aims. We revisit the density and radiation field intensity diagnostics provided by the observations of many rotational levels of inter- stellar C$_2$ and extensive molecular information. Methods. We built an excitation model of C2 without spatial structure, including levels up to J= 34 where updated radiative and collisional excitation data are introduced as well as excitation by chemical formation. Results. We confirm the importance of the recent collisional excitation rate coefficients of C$_2$ by molecular H$_2$. We show that the new higher level observations cannot be explained by the standard balance between collisional excitation and radiative transitions. We propose that chemical excitation at formation provides a plausible mechanism to explain the observed high excitation of C$_2$. In addition, it allows us to lift the degeneracy of the density over radiation field strength parameter in the excitation model. Conclusions. A 0D model remains limited and it is highly desirable to use a full Photon Dominated Region (PDR) model, which includes all excitation processes introduced here and full chemical and thermal balance.
#### PRODIGE - envelope to disk with NOEMA: V. Low 12C/13C ratios for CH3OH and CH3CN in hot corinos

 - **Abstract**
 The 12C/13C isotope ratio has been derived towards numerous cold clouds (20-50 K) and a couple protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres. However, direct measurements of this ratio in the warm gas (>100 K) around young low-mass protostars remain scarce, but are required to study its evolution during star and planet formation. We derived 12C/13C ratios from the isotopologues of the complex organic molecules (COMs) CH3OH and CH3CN in the warm gas towards seven Class 0/I protostellar systems to improve our understanding of the evolution of the 12C/13C ratios during star and planet formation. We used the data that were taken as part of the PRODIGE large program with the NOEMA at 1mm. The emission of CH3OH and CH3CN is spatially unresolved in the PRODIGE data (300au scale). Derived rotational temperatures exceed 100K, telling us that they trace the gas of the hot corino, where CH3CN probes hotter regions than CH3OH on average (290 K versus 180 K). The column density ratios between the 12C and 13C isotopologues, derived from LTE analysis, range from 4 to 30, thus, are significantly lower than the expected local ISM isotope ratio of about 68. Assuming that CH3CN and CH3OH may inherit the 12C/13C ratio from their precursor species, astrochemical models were conducted for the latter and compared with our observational results. We conclude that an enrichment in 13C in COMs at the earliest protostellar stages is likely inherited from the COMs' precursor species, whose 12C/13C ratios are set during the prestellar stage via isotopic exchange reactions. This also implies that low 12C/13C ratios observed at later evolutionary stages could at least partially be inherited. A final conclusion on 12C/13C ratios in protostellar environments requires improved observations to tackle current observational limitations and additional modelling efforts.
