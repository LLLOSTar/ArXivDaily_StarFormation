 - **Abstract**
 Planets orbiting one of the two stars in a binary are vulnerable to gravitational perturbations from the other star. Particularly, highly eccentric companion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system TOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in the habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far. Here, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters throughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary, stabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it otherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after getting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI 4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its eccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a single-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from the same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line distances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study highlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\gtrsim\rm Gyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence in such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their orbital configuration and formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z>3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~ $30$ AB mag) over a relatively wide area ($25$ arcmin$^2$). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of $28.04$ AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with $z_{\rm spec}=3.613\pm0.001$, a host mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_\odot$) = $8.41^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z$_{*}$ = $0.3\pm0.1$ Z$_\odot$. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP, with a peak absolute magnitude of $-18.3$ AB mag in the rest-frame $B$-band. We model AT 2023adsv's light curve and find a good match to a $20M_\odot$ red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of $2.0\times 10^{51}$ ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift. This discovery, and the ones sure to follow, demonstrate the continued need for facilities like JWST to build a statistical sample of core-collapse SNe to understand the evolution of their properties, and to constrain the poorly understood relationship between progenitor metallicity and massive star evolution.
#### The $\texttt{MSG}$ model for cloudy substellar atmospheres: A grid of self-consistent substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation

 - **Abstract**
 State-of-the-art JWST observations are unveiling unprecedented views into the atmospheres of substellar objects in the infrared, further highlighting the importance of clouds. Current forward models struggle to fit the silicate clouds absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m observed in substellar atmospheres. In the MSG model, we aim to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium, cloud formation model DRIFT, to create a new grid of self-consistent cloudy substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation. We aim to test if this new grid is able to reproduce the silicate cloud absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m. We model substellar atmospheres with effective temperatures in the range 1200-2500 K and with $\log(g)=4.0$. We compute atmospheric structures that self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on microphysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to help converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are computed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud microphysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different nucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient atmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$ nucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the currently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with SiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the near-infrared. The grid is unable to reproduce the silicate features similar to those found in recent JWST observations and Spitzer archival data. We thoroughly discuss further work that may better approximate the impact of convection in cloud-forming regions and steps that may help resolve the silicate cloud feature.
#### Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots and Nucleosynthesis

 - **Abstract**
 Upon their evaporation via Hawking radiation, primordial black holes (PBHs) may deposit energy in the ambient plasma on scales smaller than the typical distance between two black holes, leading to the formation of hot spots around them. We investigate how the corresponding rise of the local temperature during the evaporation may act as a shield against the release of low-energy photons, affecting PBH's capacity to dissociate light nuclei after Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis through photo-dissociation. We study the different ways PBH hot spots affect the flux of low-energy photons expected from PBH evaporation, and we find that such effects can be particularly relevant to the physics of photo-dissociation during Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis for PBHs with masses between $10^{11}$g and $3\times 10^{12}$g. We emphasize that the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent on the specific shape of the temperature profile around PBHs and its time evolution. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive study of PBH hot spots and their dynamics in the future.
#### Phase-resolved Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 Spectroscopy of Weakly-Irradiated Brown Dwarf GD 1400 and Energy Redistribution-Irradiation Trends in Six WD$-$BD Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality $\mathit{HST}$/WFC3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf + brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak ($\sim$1\%) phase curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Sub-band light curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and night-side spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher day-side temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete "Dancing with Dwarfs" WD$-$BD sample. The trend we find in the day-side/night-side temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than $\sim$10$^9$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ and decreasing efficiency above that level.
#### Expanding Molecular Shell and Possible {\gamma}-ray Source Associated with Supernova Remnant Kesteven 67

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kesteven 67 (G18.8+0.3) using observations in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$,and HCN lines and possible associated $\gamma$-ray emission using 16-yr Fermi-LAT observation. We find that the SNR is closely surrounded by a molecular belt in the southeastern boundary, with the both recessed in the band-like molecular gas structure along the Galactic plane. The asymmetric molecular line profiles are widely present in the surrounding gas around local-standard-of-rest velocity +20 km s$^{-1}$. The secondary components centered at $\sim$+16km s$^{-1}$ in the belt and $\sim$+26 km s$^{-1}$ in the northern clump can be ascribed to the motion of a wind-blown molecular shell. This explanation is supported by the position-velocity diagram along a line cutting across the remnant, which shows an arc-like pattern, suggesting an expanding gas structure. With the simulation of chemical effects of shock propagation, the abundance ratios $N$(HCO$^+$)/$N$($^{12}$CO) $\sim2.6\times 10^{-5}$--$3.6\times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the belt can be more naturally interpreted by the wind-driven bubble shock than by the SNR shock. The belt and northern clump are very likely to be parts of an incomplete molecular shell of bubble driven by O-type progenitor star's wind. The analysis of 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission uncovers a possible point source (`Source~A') about 6.5$\sigma$ located in the north of the SNR, which essentially corresponds to northern molecular clump. Our spectral fit of the emission indicates that a hadronic origin is favored by the measured Galactic number ratio between CR electrons and protons $\sim0.01$.
#### Potential-density pairs for galaxy discs with exponential or sech$^2$ vertical profile

 - **Abstract**
 We present axially symmetric analytical potential-density pairs with surface density similar to the Miyamoto-Nagai model, but with more realistic vertical structure. Our models closely approximate an exponential, a sech$^2$, or a cored exponential vertical density profile. The latter profile has a density core of adjustable width, which provides more flexibility when modelling galaxy discs.
#### Fast Multi-tone Phase Calibration Signal Extraction

 - **Abstract**
 This paper discusses a fast algorithm for analyzing the phases of a multi-tone phase calibration signal. The multi-tone method is superior to its single-tone counterpart. The PCal signal is a wide-band frequency comb derived from an ultra-stable frequency standard which is then coupled into the input stage of the radio astronomy receiver chain. The frequency comb allows to determine the signal delay, frequency response and phase shifts induced by the radio telescope instrumentation. The instrumentation delay is one of the several delay components that have to be compensated for in multi-telescope aperture synthesis. The frequency response also helps to monitor the instrumentation. To extract the information from the digitized baseband output of the receiver chain calls for fast numerical methods. A simple fast algorithm is presented in this paper. Two implementations are provided. One is based on precomputed look-up tables. The other is based on fast digital sinewave generators. Both lend themselves to parallel software processing on multi-core and SIMD-capable platforms as well as processing with FPGA gateware. We present optimized reference implementations for Intel/AMD, IBM Cell and nVidia GPU platforms.

 - **Abstract**
 A consensus has been reached in recent years that binarity plays an important role in the formation and evolution of a significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe). Utilizing the archived photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, we conducted a comprehensive data mining in search for brightness variations in a large sample of Galactic PNe. This effort leads to identification of 39 PNe, whose central stars exhibit periodic variation in light curves. Among these objects, 20 are known binary central stars of PNe, while the remaining 19 are new discoveries. Additionally, we identified 14 PNe with central stars displaying anomalous variation in light curves, as well as eight variables based on the high-cadence photometric data. Among the new discoveries of periodicity, we found compelling evidence of binary systems at the centres of two archetypal quadrupolar PNe. We also report on very peculiar brightness variation observed in the central core of the compact PN NGC6833. Several PNe in our sample deserve follow-up observations, both high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-precision photometry, to reveal the true nature of their central binarity or even multiplicity.
#### Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.
