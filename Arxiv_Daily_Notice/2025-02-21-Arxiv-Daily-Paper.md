 - **Abstract**
 We investigated various emission properties of extremely low metallicity stellar populations in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), using the new GALSEVN model, which has shown promising agreement between spectral predictions and observations at lower redshifts and higher metallicities. We find that emission-line diagnostics previously proposed to discriminate between population III (Pop III) stars and other primordial ionizing sources are effective, but only for stellar-population ages below $\sim1$ Myr. We provide other key quantities relevant to modeling Pop III stellar populations in the EoR, such as the production efficiency of ionizing photons, which is critical for reionization studies, the production rate of Lyman-Werner photons, which can dissociate H$_2$ and influence the efficiency of star formation, and the rates of different types of supernovæ, offering insights into the timescales of chemical enrichment in metal-poor environments. We complement our study with a self-consistent investigation of the gravitational-wave signals generated by the mergers of binary black holes that formed through stellar evolution and their detectability. The results presented here provide valuable predictions for the study of the EoR, on the crucial role of low-metallicity stellar populations in reionization mechanisms and star formation, as well as meaningful insights into potential observational counterparts to direct detections of Pop III stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Current observations indicate that stars with higher rotation rates appear to maintain more surface lithium, and the majority of lithium-rich giants are indeed red clump stars. Hence, we investigate the mechanisms behind lithium enrichment in rotating red clump stars and the pathways to forming lithium-rich red clump stars. Meridional circulation is prevalent in the radiative zone of rotating giants. We model its radial mixing as a diffusion process and derive the corresponding diffusion coefficient based on its material transfer effect. Due to uncertainties in numerical calculations, we consider an average diffusion effect. Additionally, certain limiting conditions for the radial velocity of meridional circulation are incorporated. With varying input rotation velocities, we simulate the lithium evolution for red clump stars with this model. Our results indicate that the material transfer effect due to meridional circulation can efficiently transport beryllium, produced by H burning, into the convective envelope. This meridional circulation can lead to lithium enrichment, with a maximum lithium abundance increment approaching \(3.0\,\rm dex\). Consequently, it is capable of forming both lithium-rich and super lithium-rich red clump stars. The degree of lithium enrichment exhibits a strong positive correlation with the rotation velocity, i.e., faster red clump stars show more surface lithium. Furthermore, our models indicate that lithium-rich red clump stars are relatively young (\(\sim 10^6\,\rm yr\)), which aligns with observation evidences.
#### The 4-400 GHz Survey for the 32 Class II Disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We have compiled the $\sim$4-400 GHz broad spectra of 32 Class II protoplanetary disks in the Taurus-Auriga region, which represents the brightest one-third of sources detected in the submillimeter band in this region. The spectra at >20 GHz frequency can be described with a piecewise function: (1) a power law with a spectral index $\sim$2 at >200 GHz, (2) a power law with spectral index in the range 0.3-4.2 at 20-50 GHz, and (3) a transition region in between these two power laws which can be characterized by a sigmoid function. This suggests that the flux densities at >200 GHz and <50 GHz are dominated by distinct emission components. At >200 GHz, the emission is likely dominated by the optically thick dust thermal emission in the bulk of the disks. In some sources that were not detected at 6.8 GHz or 10 GHz, embedded high-density dust substructures may contribute to a significant fraction of the flux densities at 30-50 GHz, and the spectral indices are mostly consistent with 2.0. Although, at 30-50 GHz, free-free and/or synchrotron emission may be significant, and some sources in our sample have spectral indices < 2.0. Based on these results, we hypothesize that high-density dust substructures (e.g., vortices) are often found in resolved Class II protoplanetary disks, and are a precursor to the formation of kilometer-sized planetesimals and rocky planets. They may not present high contrast at >200 GHz frequencies owing to the high optical depth. To probe these dust substructures, high angular resolution observations at <100 GHz are necessary to distinguish them from free-free and synchrotron emission sources. Otherwise, in the analyses of the spatially unresolved spectra, one needs to simultaneously constrain the flux densities of free-free, synchrotron, and dust emission with the observations at $\sim$5-50 GHz.
#### Do Short GRBs Exhibit an Anticorrelation between Their Intrinsic Duration and Redshift?

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are violent stellar explosions that are traditionally divided into two groups: short bursts (SGRBs) with an observed duration T90 < 2 s, and long bursts (LGRBs) with an observed duration T90 > 2 s, where T90 refers to the time needed for 90% of the fluence to be detected. Studies of progenitor models suggest that LGRBs emanate from the core collapse of massive stars, while SGRBs result from the merging of two compact objects, like two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Recent studies have found evidence that there is an anticorrelation between the intrinsic duration and the redshift of long GRBs. In this study, we first check whether LGRBs exhibit an anticorrelation between their intrinsic duration and redshift using an expanded dataset of long bursts that we have compiled. Next, we investigate whether this anticorrelation applies to SGRBs as well using a sample of short GRBs that we have compiled. Our analysis confirms the results obtained by previous studies regarding the anticorrelation for LGRBs. On the other hand, our results indicate that short GRBs do not exhibit such an anticorrelation. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of how metallicity evolves with redshift and the role that it might play in the aforementioned anticorrelation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) is a wide-field instrument mounted on the 4m V. Blanco Telescope (CTIO). Its impressive technical characteristics makes it one of the most suitable ground-based telescope for the production of accurate stellar photometry even towards crowded regions such as the Magellanic Clouds. We analysed DECam images acquired from February 2018 to January 2020 towards the Small Magellanic Cloud. We performed a PSF photometry by using the SExtractor and PSFEx tools and producing a comprehensive photometric catalogue in the SDSS system, considering the $gri$ filters. Then, we present COSMIC-S, a photometric catalogue consisting of 10 971 906 sources, including $gri$ magnitudes with a mean error $<\sigma_m> \simeq 0.04$ mag. A total of 2 456 434 sources have good photometry in all three bands. The catalogue appears virtually complete to $m \simeq 22$, with a limiting magnitude $m\simeq 25$. We derived the colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams in order to prove the goodness of the catalogue.
#### TOI-512: Super-Earth transiting a K-type star discovered by TESS and ESPRESSO

 - **Abstract**
 One of the goals of the ESPRESSO guaranteed time observations (GTOs) at the ESO 8.2m telescope is to follow up on candidate planets from transit surveys such as the TESS mission. High-precision radial velocities are required to characterize small exoplanets. Aims. We intend to confirm the existence of a transiting super-Earth around the bright (V=9.74) K0-type star TOI-512 (TIC 119292328) and provide a characterization. Combining photometric data from TESS and 37 high-resolution spectroscopic observations from ESPRESSO in a joint Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, we determined the planetary parameters of TOI-512b and characterized its internal structure. We find that TOI-512b is a super-Earth, with a radius of $1.54 \pm 0.10$ R$_\oplus$ and mass of $3.57_{-0.55}^{+0.53}$~M$_\oplus$, on a $7.19_{-6.1\cdot 10^{-5}}^{+7\cdot 10^{-5}}$ day orbit. This corresponds to a bulk density of $5.62_{-1.28}^{+1.59}$ g cm$^{-3}$. Our interior structure analysis presents a small inner core representing $0.13^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ of the solid mass fraction for the planet, surrounded by a mantle with a mass fraction of $0.69^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$, and an upper limit of the water layer of $0.16$. The gas mass below $10^{-8.93}$ indicates a very small amount of gas on the planet. We find no evidence of the second candidate found by the TESS pipeline, TOI-512.02, neither in TESS photometry, nor in the ESPRESSO radial velocities. The low stellar activity makes it an interesting transmission spectroscopy candidate for future-generation instruments.

 - **Abstract**
 Current- and next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments will measure polarization anisotropies with unprecedented sensitivities. The need for high precision in these measurements underscores the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of instrument properties, with a particular emphasis on the study of the beam properties and, in particular, their polarization characteristics, and the measurement of the polarization angle. In this context, a major challenge lies in the scarcity of millimeter polarized astrophysical sources with sufficient brightness and calibration knowledge to meet the stringent accuracy requirements of future CMB missions. This led to the development of a drone-borne calibration source designed for frequency band centered on approximately 90 GHz band, matching a commonly used channel in ground based CMB measurements. The PROTOtype CALibrator for Cosmology, PROTOCALC, has undergone thorough in-lab testing, and its properties have been subsequently modeled through simulation software integrated into the standard Simons Observatory (SO) analysis pipeline. Moreover, the PROTOCALC system has been tested in the field, having been deployed twice on calibration campaigns with CMB telescopes in the Atacama desert. The data collected constrain the roll angle of the source with a statistical accuracy of $0.045^\circ$.
#### MHD Modeling of the Near-Sun Evolution of Coronal Mass Ejection Initiated from a Sheared Arcade

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are phenomena in which the Sun suddenly releases a mass of energy and magnetized plasma, potentially leading to adverse space weather. Numerical simulation provides an important avenue for comprehensively understanding the structure and mechanism of CMEs. Here we present a global-corona MHD simulation of a CME originating from sheared magnetic arcade and its interaction with the near-Sun solar wind. Our simulation encompasses the pre-CME phase with gradual accumulation of free magnetic energy (and building up of a current sheet within the sheared arcade) as driven by the photospheric shearing motion, the initiation of CME as magnetic reconnection commences at the current sheet, and its subsequent evolution and propagation to around 0.1 AU. A twisted magnetic flux rope (MFR), as the main body of the CME, is created by the continuous reconnection during the eruption. By interacting with the ambient field, the MFR experiences both rotation and deflection during the evolution. The CME exhibits a typical three-part structure, namely a bright core, a dark cavity and a bright front. The bright core is mainly located at the lower part of the MFR, where plasma is rapidly pumped in by the high-speed reconnection outflow. The dark cavity contains both outer layer of the MFR and its overlying field that expands rapidly as the whole magnetic structure moves out. The bright front is formed due to compression of plasma ahead of the fast-moving magnetic structure. Future data-driven modeling of CME will be built upon this simulation with real observations used for the bottom boundary conditions.
#### Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. II. 3D Analysis and Dependence on Projection and Selection Effects

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the distribution of subhalos in the vicinity of dark matter halo pairs in the Illustris-TNG simulation. The satellites around halo pairs with separations $d_{\text{sep}} > 0.5~h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$ exhibit a non-uniform distribution, which is a combined result of two distinct features: the ``bulging'' distribution, characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the ``lopsided'' distribution, which shows an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs that are more widely separated and involve less massive halos, while the lopsidedness strengthens as the halo mass increases. Both signals depend weakly on halo mass ratio, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. These measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our results imply that the lopsidedness and bulging distribution may arise from two distinct origins: the former is caused simply by the overlap of two closely placed halos, while the latter is driven by the alignment of halos with large-scale filamentary structures. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis of satellite distribution in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large pair separations, low halo masses, and large halo mass ratios.
#### Catching the wisps: Stellar mass-loss limits from low-frequency radio observations

 - **Abstract**
 The winds of low-mass stars carry away angular momentum and impact the atmospheres of surrounding planets. Determining the properties of these winds is necessary to understand the mass-loss history of the star and the evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres. Due to their tenuous nature, the winds of low-mass main-sequence stars are difficult to detect. The few existing techniques for measuring these winds are indirect, with the most common inference method for winds of low-mass stars being astrospheric Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption combined with complex hydrodynamical modelling of the interaction between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium. Here, we employ a more direct method to place upper limits on the mass-loss rates of low-mass stars by combining observations of low-frequency coherent radio emission, the lack of free-free absorption, and a simple stellar wind model. We determine upper limits on the mass-loss rate for a sample of 19 M dwarf stars detected with the LOFAR telescope at 120--168 MHz, reaching a sensitivity within an order of magnitude of the solar mass-loss rate for cold stars with a surface magnetic field strength of $\sim$100 G. The sensitivity of our method does not depend on distance or spectral type, allowing us to find mass-loss rate constraints for stars up to spectral type M6 and out to a distance of 50 pc, later and farther than previous measurements. With upcoming low-frequency surveys with both LOFAR and the Square Kilometre Array, the number of stars with mass-loss rate upper limits determined with this method could reach $\sim$1000.

 - **Abstract**
 This review provides an observational perspective on the fundamental properties of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes in quasars. It begins by outlining the selection criteria, particularly focusing on optical and UV broad-line intensity ratios, used to identify a population of unobscured super-Eddington candidates. Several defining features place these candidates at the extreme end of the Population A in main sequence of quasars: among them are the highest observed singly-ionized iron emission, extreme outflow velocities in UV resonance lines, and unusually high metal abundances. These key properties reflect the coexistence of a virialized sub-system within the broad-line region alongside powerful outflows, with the observed gas enrichment likely driven by nuclear or circumnuclear star formation. The most compelling evidence for the occurrence of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes comes from recent observations of massive black holes at early cosmic epochs. These black holes require rapid growth rates that are only achievable through radiatively inefficient super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, extreme Eddington ratios, close to or slightly exceeding unity, are consistent with the saturation of radiative output per unit mass predicted by accretion disk theory for super-Eddington accretion rates. The extreme properties of super-Eddington candidates suggest that these quasars could make them stable and well-defined cosmological distance indicators, leveraging the correlation between broad-line width and luminosity expected in virialized systems. Finally, several analogies with accretion processes around stellar-mass black holes, particularly in the high/soft state, are explored to provide additional insight into the mechanisms driving super-Eddington accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.
