 - **Abstract**
 Disc instability (DI) is a model aimed at explaining the formation of companions through the fragmentation of the circumstellar gas disc. Furthermore, DI could explain the formation of part of the observed exoplanetary population. We aim to provide a new comprehensive global model for the formation of companions via DI. The latter leads for the companions to orbital migration and damping of the eccentricities and inclinations. As it evolves, the disc is continuously monitored for self-gravity and fragmentation. When the conditions are satisfied, one (or several) clumps are inserted. The evolution of the clumps is then followed in detail. We showcased the model by performing a number of simulations for various initial conditions, from simple non-fragmenting systems to complex systems with many fragments. We confirm that the DIPSY model is a comprehensive and versatile global model of companion formation via DI. It enables studies of the formation of companions with planetary to low stellar masses around primaries with final masses that range from the brown dwarf to the B-star regime. We conclude that it is necessary to consider the many interconnected processes such as gas accretion, orbital migration, and N-body interactions, as they strongly influence the inferred population of forming objects. It is also clear that model assumptions play a key role in the determination of the systems undergoing formation.
#### DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, II. The Populations of Companions Formed Through Disc Instability

 - **Abstract**
 We applied the global end-to-end model described in Paper~I of this series to perform a population synthesis of companions formed via disc instability (DI). By using initial conditions compatible with both observations and hydrodynamical simulations, and by studying a large range of primary masses (0.05-5 Msol), we can provide quantitative predictions of the outcome of DI. In the baseline population, we find that ~10 % of the discs fragment, and about half of these end up with a surviving companion after 100 Myr. 75\% of the companions are in the brown dwarf regime, 15 % are low-mass stars, and 10 % planets. At distances larger than ~100 au, DI produces planetary-mass companions on a low percent level. Inside of 100 AU, however, planetary-mass companions are very rare (low per mill level). The average companion mass is ~30 Mj scaling weakly with stellar mass. Most of the initial fragments do not survive on a Myr timescale; they either collide with other fragments or are ejected, resulting in a population of free-floating objects (about 1-2 per star). We also quantify several variant populations to critically assess some of our assumptions used in the baseline population. DI appears to be a key mechanism in the formation of distant companions with masses ranging from low-mass stars down to the planetary regime, contributing, however, only marginally to planetary mass objects inside of 100 AU. Our results are sensitive to a number of physical processes, which are not completely understood. Two of them, gas accretion and clump-clump collisions, are particularly important and need to be investigated further. Magnetic fields and heavy-element accretion have not been considered in our study, although they are also expected to affect the inferred population. We suggest acknowledging the importance of the gravito-turbulent phase, which most protoplanetary discs experience.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fast and robust analytic framework for predicting surface brightness (SB) of emission lines in galactic winds as a function of radius up to $\sim 100$ kpc out in the circum-galactic medium. We model multi-phase structure in galactic winds by capturing emission from both the volume-filling hot phase (T $\sim 10^{6-7}$ K) and turbulent radiative mixing layers that host intermediate temperature gas at the boundaries of cold clouds (T $\sim 10^4$ K). Our multi-phase framework makes significantly different predictions of emission signatures compared to traditional single-phase models. We emphasize how ram pressure equilibrium between the cold clouds and hot wind in supersonic outflows, non-equilibrium ionization effects, and energy budgets other than mechanical energy from core-collapse supernovae affect our SB predictions and allow us to better match OVI observations in the literature. Our framework reveals that the optimal galactic wind properties that facilitate OVI emission observations above a detection limit of $\sim 10^{-18} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1} \ cm^{-2} \ arcsec^{-2}}$ are star formation rate surface density $1 \lesssim \dot{\Sigma}_{\ast} \lesssim 20 \ M_{\odot}\ \rm{yr^{-1}\ kpc^{-2}}$, hot phase mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm M,hot} \sim 0.2 - 0.4$, and thermalization efficiency factor $\eta_{\rm E} \gtrsim 0.8$. These findings are consistent with existing observations and can help inform future target selections.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a kinematic and dynamical analysis of six Galactic open clusters NGC~2204, NGC~2660, NGC~2262, Czernik~32, Pismis~18, and NGC~2437, using \textit{Gaia}~DR3. We used Bayesian and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) methods to identify cluster members, but chose GMM because it's more appropriate for low-mass stars. Estimated distances range from 1.76 to 4.20~kpc and ages from 0.199 to 1.95~Gyr, confirming their intermediate-age nature. King model fits indicate compact morphologies, with core radii of 1--10~arcmin and cluster radii of 5--24~arcmin. We identify 13 BSS and 3 YSS members, whose central concentrations suggest origins via mass transfer or stellar collisions. The mass function slopes (0.96--1.19) are flatter than the Salpeter value, which indicates that these clusters have undergone dynamical mass segregation. Orbit integration within a Galactic potential indicates nearly circular orbits (eccentricities 0.02--0.10), vertical excursions within $\pm$132~pc, and guiding radii near the solar circle, suggesting disk confinement. These clusters likely formed in the thin disk and are shaped by Galactic tidal perturbations, facilitating the rapid loss of low-mass members. Additionally, twelve variable stars were found across four clusters using \textit{TESS} light curves, including $\gamma$~Doradus and SPB pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and a yellow straggler candidate. Periods were derived via Lomb-Scargle analysis. Two eclipsing binaries (TIC~94229743 and TIC~318170024) were modeled using PHOEBE, yielding mass ratios of 1.37 and 2.16, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that integrating orbital dynamics and variable star studies presents valuable insights into the evolutionary pathways of open clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Beta Pictoris is an A-type star hosting a complex planetary system with two massive gas giants and a prominent debris disk. Variable absorption lines in its stellar spectrum have been interpreted as signatures of exocomets (comet-like bodies transiting the star). Stellar flybys can gravitationally perturb objects in the outer comet reservoir, altering their orbits and potentially injecting them into the inner system, thereby triggering exocomet showers. We aim to assess the contribution of stellar flybys to the observed exocomet activity by reconstructing the stellar encounter history of beta Pictoris in the past and future. We used Gaia DR3 data, supplemented with radial velocities from complementary spectroscopic surveys, to compile a catalogue of stars currently within 80 pc of beta Pictoris. Their orbits were integrated backward and forward in time in an axisymmetric Galactic potential (Gala package) to identify encounters within 2 pc of the system. We identified 99 416 stars within 80 pc of beta Pictoris at present with resolved kinematics. Among these, 49 stars (including the eight components of five binaries) encounter beta Pictoris within 2 pc between -1.5 Myr and +2 Myr. For four of the binaries, the centre-of-mass trajectories also pass within 2 pc. We estimate the sample to be more than 60 % complete within 0.5 Myr of the present. Despite beta Pictoris being the eponym of its famous moving group, none of the identified encounters involved its moving group members; all are unrelated field stars. We find no encounter capable of shaping observed disc structures, although stellar flybys may contribute to the long-term evolution of a potential Oort Cloud. Our catalogue constitutes the most complete reconstruction of the beta Pictoris encounter history to date and provides a robust foundation for future dynamical simulations.
#### A Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Young Stellar Objects in the SMC Region NGC 346: JWST Detects Dust, Accretion, Ices and Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of $\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe ($z$$\simeq$2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9$\mu$m and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M$_{\odot}$. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H$_2$ and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10$^{-6}$-2.23x10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a $\sim$30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H$_2$ emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astrophysics have experienced rapid growth over the past decade, seeking a complete picture of different cosmic phenomena. Transient sources, in particular, benefit from the input of multi-messenger observations, offering complementary perspectives on the same event while maximizing the detection probability of a rapidly fading signal. In this context, Gravitational Wave (GW) detections serve as perfect triggers for potential counterpart detections. Notably, a GW alert could be associated with a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB), jetted cataclysmic events produced either by the collision of a binary neutron star system or a core-collapse supernova. These sources also radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing detection by X- and gamma-ray instruments aboard various satellites and thus enabling multi-wavelength triggering opportunities. The strong interest in minimizing reaction time to capture the full-time evolution of the emission, together with the often challenging localization uncertainties of the alerts, underscores the need for rapid and well-coordinated follow-up programs such as the one developed by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration. This contribution will give an overview of the transient follow-up strategy carried out by the H.E.S.S. Collaboration, from the external alert trigger and the automatic reaction of the observatory to the various analysis steps of the obtained observations. To illustrate this comprehensive strategy, we will show two examples of follow-up observations of both GRBs and GWs, highlighting key results and challenges in the search for an associated high-energy gamma-ray emission.
#### Probing the Low Radio Frequency Emission in PG Quasars with the uGMRT - II

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02736

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from uGMRT 685 MHz observations of 87 QSOs belonging to the Palomar Green (PG) quasar sample with $z<0.5$. Radio emission is detected in all sources except for 3 radio-quiet (RQ) sources, viz., PG 0043+039, PG 1121+422, and PG 1552+085. The radio-loud (RL) $-$ RQ dichotomy persists at 685 MHz with only 1 source, PG 1216+069, changing its classification from RQ to RL. Approximately 1/3 of the detected RQ quasars display AGN-dominated radio emission while the rest may show additional contributions from stellar-related processes. Consistent with this, the RL and RQ quasars occupy distinct tracks on the `fundamental plane' of black hole activity. We find that RL quasars have $\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1}) > 25.5$, while RQ quasars have ${\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1})} <23.5$. Furthermore, the radio sizes display the RQ$-$RL divide as well with RQ sources typically having sizes $\lesssim30$ kpc, with only 16 ($\sim22$%) RQ sources having sizes between 30 and 100 kpc where there is an overlap with RL quasar sizes. A strong correlation exists between 685 MHz radio luminosity and black hole mass which is tightened when accretion rate is considered, highlighting the important role played by the accretion rate and accretion disk structure in jet production. We found no difference in the minimum-energy magnetic field strengths of the radio cores of RL and RQ quasars; however, different assumptions of source volume and volume filling factors may apply. High-resolution X-ray observations and radio-X-ray flux comparisons are needed to independently test the `magnetic flux paradigm'.
#### A $z\simeq0.4$ Little Red Dot analog: An Extended Starburst with an Overmassive Black hole

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z > 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 Msun, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 IC 443 is a well-known supernova remnant that stands out due to its interaction with a dense molecular cloud, creating a complex environment where shocks can efficiently accelerate particles to high energies. This makes it a key target for investigating the mechanisms of cosmic-ray acceleration and gamma-ray production, particularly in the context of supernova remnants as potential sources of PeV cosmic rays. This work presents a first analysis of the region as observed by H.E.S.S.. We detect extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from IC 443, consistent with previous observations by VERITAS and MAGIC. A multi-wavelength comparison incorporating data from Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, and VERITAS strongly supports a hadronic origin of the observed emission, and highlights the presence of relativistic protons interacting with the surrounding molecular cloud. These findings reinforce the role of IC 443 as a key laboratory for studying supernova remnants as cosmic-ray accelerators and their interaction with their surrounding mediums.
#### The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds III. The first, extragalactic Mg-K anticorrelation: the LMC globular cluster NGC 1786

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we derived [K/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios for six stars of the old globular cluster NGC 1786 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We employed high-resolution spectra acquired with the MIKE spectrograph mounted at the Magellan/Clay telescope. We found a clear Mg-K anticorrelation among the analyzed stars. In particular, the Mg-poor stars ([Mg/Fe] < 0.0 dex) are enriched by ~ 0.25 dex in [K/Fe] compared to the Mg-rich stars ([Mg/Fe] > 0.0 dex). This finding makes NGC 1786 the first globular cluster residing in an external galaxy in which such extreme chemical anomaly has been detected. The observed trend nicely agrees with those observed in Galactic globular clusters hosting Mg-poor stars, such as NGC 2808, and Omega Centauri suggesting that such chemical anomaly is an ubiquitous feature of old, massive, and metal-poor stellar systems and it does not depend on the properties of the parent galaxy in which the cluster formed. Also, Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations were detected among the stars of NGC 1786. The newly discovered Mg-K anticorrelation reinforces the idea that stars capable of activating the complete MgAl cycle are responsible for the observed chemical anomalies in these clusters. In this context, asymptotic giant branch stars seem to be a valuable model since they are able to produce K while depleting Mg. However, the precise and complete physics of this model remains a subject of debate.

 - **Abstract**
 We re-investigated the distance to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 by analyzing its dust scattering halo (DSH) using high-resolution X-ray (Chandra) and millimeter (APEX) observations. Dust scattering halos form when X-rays from a compact source are scattered by interstellar dust, creating diffuse ring-like structures that can provide clues about the source's distance. Our previous work suggested two possible distances: 4.9 kpc and 11.5 kpc, but uncertainties remained due to low-resolution CO maps. We developed a new methodology to refine these estimates, starting with a machine learning approach to determine a 3D representation of molecular clouds from the APEX dataset. The 3D maps are combined with X-ray flux measurements to generate synthetic DSH images. By comparing synthetic images with the observed Chandra data through radial and azimuthal profile fitting, we not only measure the source distance but also distinguish whether the molecular clouds are at their near or far distances. The current analysis again supported a distance of 11.5 kpc over alternative estimates. While the method produced a lower reduced chi-squared for both the azimuthal and radial fits for a distance of 13.6 kpc, we ruled it out as it would have produced a bright ring beyond the APEX field of view, which is not seen in the Chandra image. The 4.85 kpc estimate was also excluded due to poor fit quality and cloud distance conflicts. The systematic error of 1 kpc, arising from uncertainties in determining molecular cloud distances, dominates the total error.

 - **Abstract**
 Red giant stars play a key role in advancing our understanding of stellar mass loss. However, its initial mass and the amount of mass lost during this phase remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the asteroseismic signatures of mass loss and the parameters that influence it. We examine six stars identified as red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APOKASC-2 catalog. Assuming these stars are on their first ascent of the RGB, we construct interior models. The resulting model ages are significantly older than the age of the Galaxy, indicating that these stars are likely experiencing mass loss and evolving toward the red clump (RC) phase. The minimum possible initial masses are estimated using the mass-metallicity diagram, from which we infer that the minimum mass lost by these stars ranges from $0.1$-$0.3{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Models constructed with an initial minimum mass yield the maximum possible age of the star. The ages of these models fall within the range of 9-9.5Gyr. For two stars, asteroseismic parameters confirm RC classification. Due to degeneracies in the HR diagram, distinguishing between internal structure models is challenging; however, asteroseismic constraints provide clear differentiation. Although mass-loss and mass-conservation models have similar $M$, $R$, and $T_{\rm eff}$ values, $\Delta\nu$s determined from the $l$=0 modes in the mass-loss models are 5-10$\%$ higher than observed. This discrepancy may arise from differences in internal structure. Finally, evolutionary model grids are used to examine how initial mass and $Z$ affect mass loss. Mass loss increases with increasing metallicity and decreases with increasing initial mass, regardless of the adopted value of $\eta$.
#### A quest for sulfur-bearing refractory species. Identification of CaS in the interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of refractory molecules in massive star-forming regions provides a means of probing the innermost regions of disks around massive stars. These detections also make it possible to explore the chemical composition of refractories through gas-phase observations. In this regard, identifying refractory compounds containing sulfur could reveal potential connections between sulfur and refractories, as well as help determine the sulfur budget in these extreme environments. We find convincing evidence of a reliable detection of CaS, and tentative detections of KS and KSH in the disk G351.77-mm1. These are the first ever identifications of these species in the interstellar medium. The CaS, KS, and KSH column densities are about 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of the abundant sulfur compounds SO$_2$, CH$_3$SH and SiS, proving that these species are not the major reservoir of sulfur at the spatial scales probed by our observations. Higher angular resolution observations at different wavelengths are required to confirm these detections, which are of paramount importance to gain insights into the formation of gas-phase refractory molecules.

 - **Abstract**
 Artificial Light At Night (ALAN) has been increasing steadily over the past century, particularly during the last decade. This leads to rising light pollution, which is known to have adverse effects on living organisms, including humans. We present a new software package to model light pollution from ground radiance measurements. The software is called Otus 3 and incorporates innovative ALAN diffusion models with different atmospheric profiles, cloud covers and urban emission functions. To date, light pollution modelling typically focused on calculating the zenith luminance of the skyglow produced by city lights. In Otus 3 we extend this and additionally model the horizontal illuminance on the ground, including the contributions from skyglow and the direct illumination. We applied Otus 3 to France using ground radiance data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We calibrated our models using precise sky brightness measurements we obtained over 6 years at 139 different locations and make this dataset publicly available. We produced the first artificial illuminance map for France for the periods of 2013-2018 and 2019-2024. We found that the artificial ground illuminance in the middle of the night decreased by 23 % between these two periods, in stark contrast to the global trend.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of cosmic-ray (CR) penetration into dense molecular clouds developed recently for relativistic particles by Chernyshov et al. (2024) is extended to non-relativistic CRs. Interstellar CRs streaming into the clouds are able to resonantly excite MHD waves in diffuse cloud envelopes. This leads to the self-modulation, such that streaming particles are scattered at the self-generated waves. In contrast to relativistic CRs, transport of lower-energy particles in the envelopes is generally heavily affected by ionization losses; furthermore, both CR protons and electrons contribute to wave excitation. We show that these effects have profound impact on the self-modulation, and can dramatically reduce CR spectra even for clouds with moderate column densities of a few times $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

 Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are Galactic-scale nanohertz-frequency gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Recently, several PTAs have found evidence for the presence of GWs in their datasets, but none of them have achieved a community-defined definitive (> 5$\sigma$) detection. Here, we identify limiting noise sources for PTAs and quantify their impact on sensitivity to GWs under different observing and noise modelling strategies. First, we search for intrinsic pulse jitter in a sample of 89 MSPs observed by the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array and obtain new jitter measurements for 20 MSPs. We then forecast jitter noise in pulsars for the future SKA-Mid telescope, finding that the timing precision of many of the best-timed MSPs would be dominated by jitter noise. We then consider dispersion measure variations from the interstellar medium and find that their effects are best mitigated by modelling them as a stationary Gaussian process with a power-law spectrum. Improving upon the established hasasia code for PTA sensitivity analysis, we assess the timing potential of the lower frequency UHF-band (544$-$1088\,MHz) of MeerKAT and find a potential increase in GW background sensitivity by $\approx 8$\%, relative to observing at L-band. We show that this improvement relies on assumptions on the propagation through the interstellar medium, and highlight that if observing frequency-dependent propagation effects, such as scattering noise, are present, where noise is not completely correlated across observing frequency, then the improvement is significantly diminished. Using the multi-frequency receivers and sub-arraying flexibility of MeerKAT, we find that focussed, high-cadence observations of the best MSPs can enhance the sensitivity of the array for both the continuous GWs and stochastic GWB. These results highlight the role of MeerKAT and the MPTA in the context of international GW search efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 The Virgo Cluster is the nearest cool core cluster that features two well-studied sloshing cold fronts at radii of $r \approx 30$ kpc and $r \approx 90$ kpc, respectively. In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic observations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \approx 250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely to be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison with a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these cold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49 from the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the south. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the disturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness profiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas the western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies that magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while its western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the X-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the cold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our findings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of the intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important implications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such as the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing ancient cold fronts.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar halos are a class of extended very-high-energy (VHE) sources highlighted by the HAWC observatory towards the Geminga pulsar and PSR B0656$+$14. These VHE sources are interpreted as the inverse Compton emission from electrons and positrons diffusing in the interstellar medium at an inhibited rate, having escaped the pulsar wind nebula. Our aim is to search for new pulsar halos using H.E.S.S. data and to constrain their physical properties. Using a physically-motivated model of pulsar halos, we created template-based models of the spatial and energetic distributions of the expected gamma-ray emission using the Gammapy library. A promising candidate source to which this model can be effectively applied is HESS J1831$-$098, an extended VHE source spatially coincident with two energetic pulsars, which also exhibits spectral continuity and morphological compatibility with the ultra-high-energy source 1LHAASO J1831$-$1007u*. It could be powered by the radio pulsar PSR J1831$-$0952 with a characteristic age of 128 kyr. We present a spectro-morphological analysis of this source with H.E.S.S. data, revealing that the emission is well described with a pulsar halo model, although we cannot reject a simple 2D Gaussian morphology. We discuss the implication of the derived physical parameters of the model.
