#### Quantifying systematic uncertainties in white dwarf cooling age determinations

 - **Abstract**
 Cooling ages of white dwarfs are routinely determined by mapping effective temperatures and masses to ages using evolutionary models. Typically, the reported uncertainties on cooling ages only consider the error propagation of the uncertainties on the spectroscopically or photometrically determined $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. However, cooling models are themselves uncertain, given their dependence on many poorly constrained inputs. This paper estimates these systematic model uncertainties. We use MESA to generate cooling sequences of $0.5-1.0 M_{\odot}$ hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores under different assumptions regarding the chemical stratification of their core, the thickness of their helium envelope, their hydrogen content, and the conductive opacities employed in the calculations. The parameter space explored is constrained by the range of values predicted by a variety of stellar evolution models and inferred from asteroseismological studies. For a $0.6 M_{\odot}$ white dwarf, we find an uncertainty of 0.03 Gyr at 10,000 K (corresponding to a 5% relative uncertainty) and 0.8 Gyr at 4000 K (9%). This uncertainty is significant, as it is comparable to the age uncertainty obtained by propagating the measurement errors on $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass for a typical white dwarf. We also separately consider the potential impact of $^{22}$Ne shell distillation, which plausibly leads to an additional uncertainty of $\sim 1$ Gyr for crystallized white dwarfs. We provide a table of our simulation results that can be used to evaluate the systematic model uncertainty based on a white dwarf's $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. We encourage its use in all future studies where white dwarf cooling ages are measured.
#### The red supergiant progenitor luminosity problem

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of pre-explosion imaging has confirmed red supergiants (RSGs) as the progenitors to Type II-P supernovae (SNe). However, extracting the RSG's luminosity requires assumptions regarding the star's temperature or spectral type and the corresponding bolometric correction, circumstellar extinction, and possible variability. The robustness of these assumptions is difficult to test, since we cannot go back in time and obtain additional pre-explosion imaging. Here, we perform a simple test using the RSGs in M31, which have been well observed from optical to mid-IR. We ask the following: By treating each star as if we only had single-band photometry and making assumptions typically used in SN progenitor studies, what bolometric luminosity would we infer for each star? How close is this to the bolometric luminosity for that same star inferred from the full optical-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED)? We find common assumptions adopted in progenitor studies systematically underestimate the bolometric luminosity by a factor of 2, typically leading to inferred progenitor masses that are systematically too low. Additionally, we find a much larger spread in luminosity derived from single-filter photometry compared to SED-derived luminosities, indicating uncertainties in progenitor luminosities are also underestimated. When these corrections and larger uncertainties are included in the analysis, even the most luminous known RSGs are not ruled out at the 3$\sigma$ level, indicating there is currently no statistically significant evidence that the most luminous RSGs are missing from the observed sample of II-P progenitors. The proposed correction also alleviates the problem of having progenitors with masses below the expected lower-mass bound for core-collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Double helium white dwarfs (He WDs) are one type of gravitational wave source and are greatly important in the studies of binary interaction, particularly in the common envelope (CE) ejection physics. Most double He WDs with mass ratios of q~1 are formed through a particular channel. In this channel, one He WD is initially produced from a red giant (RG) with a degenerate core via stable Roche lobe overflow, and another He WD is formed from an RG with a degenerate core via CE ejection. They may have significant implications for the binary evolution processes yet have not received specific studies, especially for the CE phase. This paper adopts a semi-analytic method and a detailed stellar evolution simulation to model the formation of double He WDs. We find that most double He WDs show mass ratios being slightly greater than 1, and their orbital periods and mass ratios relation are broadly consistent with observations. There is also a relation between the mass ratios and the progenitors' masses of the He WDs produced via CE ejection for double He WDs with determined WD masses. Based on this relation, the mass of the He WD progenitor can be inferred from the mass ratio. Then, the CE ejection efficiency can be constrained with the orbital period. In addition, we constrain the CE ejection efficiency for two double He WDs, J1005-2249 and WD0957-666. The results show that the CE ejection efficiencies increase with the WD progenitor masses.

 - **Abstract**
 The Radcliffe Wave has only recently been recognised as a about 3 kpc long coherent gas structure encompassing most of the star forming regions in the solar vicinity. Since its discovery, it has been mainly studied from the perspective of dynamics, but a detailed chemical study is necessary to understand its nature and the composition of the natal clouds that gave rise to it. In this paper we used some of the connected young open clusters (age $\lesssim$ 100 Myr) as tracers of the molecular clouds. We performed high-resolution spectroscopy with GIARPS at the TNG of 53 stars that are bona fide members of seven clusters located at different positions along the Radcliffe Wave. We provide radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for all of them. For a subsample consisting of 41 FGK stars we also studied the chromospheric activity and the content of Li, from which we inferred the age of the parent clusters. These values agree with the evolutionary ages reported in the literature. For these FGK stars we determined the chemical abundances for 25 species. Pleiades, ASCC 16 and NGC 7058 exhibit a solar metallicity while Melotte 20, ASCC 19, NGC 2232, and Roslund 6 show a slightly subsolar value ($\approx-$0.1 dex). On average, the clusters show a chemical composition compatible with that of the Sun, especially for $\alpha$- and Fe-peak elements. Neutron-capture elements, on the other hand, present a slight overabundance of about 0.2 dex, specially barium. Finally, considering also ASCC 123, studied by our group in a previous research, we infer a correlation between the chemical composition and the age or position of the clusters along the Wave, demonstrating their physical connection within an inhomogeneous mixing scenario.
#### Quokka-based understanding of outflows (QED) -- II. X-ray metallicity gradients as a signature of galactic wind metal loading

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova-driven galactic outflows play a vital but still poorly-understood role in galactic chemical evolution, and one of the largest uncertainties about them is the extent to which they consist of supernova ejecta that are unmixed, or only poorly-mixed, with the remainder of the interstellar medium (ISM). Simulations of wind launching make a range of predictions about the extent of mixing between the wind and the ISM, but thus far these have proven challenging to test observationally. In this study, we post-process high-resolution simulations of outflows from the QED simulation suite to generate synthetic X-ray spectra from galactic winds, which we then analyse using standard observational procedures, in order to search for detectable markers of wind mixing. Our synthetic observations reveal that partially-mixed winds show significant and detectable metallicity gradients when viewed edge-on, with metallicity decreasing away from the central galactic disc. We explore how this signature results from imperfect mixing and the extent to which measurements of it can be used to diagnose the level of mixing in winds. We determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for such measurements to be reliable, and provide a simple quantitative model that can be used to connect metallicity gradients to mixing between the hot ($T>10^{6}$ K) and cold ($T<10^{4}$ K) phases in observations that reach the required SNR, providing a framework to interpret current and future observations.
#### Planet Formation Mechanisms

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation encompasses processes that span a remarkable 40 magnitudes in mass, ranging from collisions between micron-sized grains inherit from the ISM to accretion of gas by giant planets. The planet formation process takes place in the interior of dusty disks, which offer us only limited observational constraints. Historically, the two main paradigms describing planet formation are the disk instability and core accretion models. In the former giant planets condense directly form a disk massive enough to fragments under its self-gravity. In contrast, the core accretion model follows a bottom-up approach driven by solids. This model includes the direct growth phase, where pebble and possibly planetesimal sized bodies form by surface-driven processes. Alternatively, planetesimal bodies can emerge from instabilities in the solid population, leading to the formation of clumps that ultimately collapse. The later growth phases of the core accretion model involve the creation of a protoplanet out of the planetesimal population, which then accrete smaller bodies|planetesimals or pebbles|before ultimately accreting freely the gas of the disk. In this Chapter I will review these formation mechanisms, aiming, where possible, to build an intuitive understanding from elementary physical principles.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the existence of hydrostatic equilibrium states for a composite body made of two rigidly rotating, homogeneous layers bounded by spheroidal surfaces, where the core has a prolate shape. These new configurations require an oblate envelope that spins faster than the core. No solution with a prolate envelope is found. For some parameters, the prolate core can even be at rest. Numerical experiments based on the self-consistent field method support this result in the case of heterogeneous layers with polytropic equations of state. The possible cancellation of the first gravitational moment, $J_2$, is discussed.
#### Dynamics of star associations in an SMBH-IMBH system: The case of IRS13 in the Galactic centre

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) still poses challenges to theoretical and observational astronomers. Several candidates have been proposed, including the one in the IRS13 cluster in the Galactic centre, where the evidence is based on the velocity dispersion of its members, however, none have been confirmed to date. Aims: We aim to gain insights into the presence of an IMBH in the Galactic centre by a numerical study of the dynamical interplay between an IMBH and star clusters (SCs) in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Methods: We use high-precision N-body models of IRS13-like SCs in the Galactic centre, and of more massive SCs that fall into the centre of the Galaxy from larger distances. Results: We find that at IRS13's physical distance of 0.4 pc, an IRS13-size SC cannot remain gravitationally bound even if it contains an IMBH of thousands $M_\odot$. Thus, IRS13 appears to be an incidental present-day clumping of stars. Furthermore, we show that the velocity dispersion of tidally disrupted SCs (the likely origin of IRS13) can be fully accounted for by the tidal forces of the central SMBH; the IMBH's influence is not essential.
#### Little time for oscillation: Fast disruption of the Radcliffe Wave by Galactic motions

 - **Abstract**
 The Radcliffe wave \cite{2020Natur.578..237A} is a 2.7 kpc long, 100 pc wide-like structure in the Galactic disk with a wave-like velocity structure \cite{2022MNRAS.517L.102L,2024arXiv240212596K}. A referent Nature paper \cite{2024arXiv240212596K} treated the Wave as a solid body in the disk plane, modeled its oscillation along the vertical direction, and derived the local Galactic mass distribution from the oscillation pattern. In reality, Galactic shear can stretch gas through differential rotation, whereas gas clouds experience epicyclic motions. We simulate the 3D evolution of the local interstellar gas and find shear and encyclic motion stretches the Radcliffe wave to almost twice its current length at the timescale of 45 Myr, within which only half a cycle of the proposed vertical oscillation occurs. The simulation also reveals the formation of new filaments and filament-filament mergers. Treating the Radcliffe wave as a solid body in the Galactic disk and an oscillating structure in the vertical direction is thus an oversimplification. Our data-driven simulation reveals the 3D evolution of the local interstellar gas with several processes at play, strengthening the role of the Solar Neighborhood as a unique test ground for theories of interstellar gas evolution.
#### Super-Jeans fragmentation in massive star-forming regions revealed by triangulation analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the fragmentation of the gas cloud and the formation of massive stars remains one of the most challenging questions of modern astrophysical research. Either the gas fragmentation in a Jeans-like fashion, after which the fragments grow through accretion, or the fragmentation length is larger than the Jeans length from the start. Despite significant observational efforts, a consensus has not been reached. The key is to infer the initial density distribution upon which gravitational fragmentation occurs. Since cores are the products of the fragmentation process, the distances between adjacent cores serve as a scale indicator. Based on this observation, we propose a Delaunay triangulation-based approach to infer the density structure before the fragmentation and establish the link between density distribution and gas fragmentation length. We find that at low density, the fragmenting is Jeans-like, and at high densities, the core separations are larger than the prediction of the Jeans fragmentation. This super-Jeans fragmentation, which often occurs in groups, is responsible for the clustered formation of massive stars.
#### Inverted EEMD: a robust method to identify narrow absorption features form spectral data and cubes

 - **Abstract**
 Extracting information from complex data is a challenge shared by multiple frontiers of modern astrophysical research. Among those, analyzing spectra cubes, where the emission is mapped in the position-position-velocity space is a difficult task given the vast amount of information contained within. The cubes often contain a superposition of emissions and absorptions, where extracting absorption signatures is often necessary. One example is the extraction of narrow absorption structures in HI 21 cm emission spectra. These HI self-absorption (HISA) clouds trace the cold HI gas in interstellar space. We introduce an automatic and robust method called the \emph{inverted EEMD} method to extract narrow features from spectral cubes. Our method is based on the EEMD method, an established method to decompose 1d signals. The method is robust and parameter-free, making it useful in analyzing spectral cubes containing localized absorption signals of different types. The inverted-EEMD method is suitable for the analysis of spectral cubes where it can produce a cube containing the absorption signal and one containing the unabsorbed signal, where cold clouds can be identified as coherent regions in the absorption map. A Python implementation of the method is available at \url{this https URL}.
