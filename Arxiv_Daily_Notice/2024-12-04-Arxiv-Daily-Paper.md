 - **Abstract**
 Significant mass loss in the red supergiant (RSG) phase has great influence on the evolution of massive stars and their final fate as supernovae. We present near-infrared interferometric imaging of the circumstellar environment of the dust-enshrouded RSG WOH G64 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. WOH G64 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.0--2.45 micron. We succeeded in imaging the innermost circumstellar environment of WOH G64 -- the first interferometric imaging of an RSG outside the Milky Way. The reconstructed image reveals elongated compact emission with a semimajor and semiminor axis of ~2 and ~1.5 mas (~13 and 9 stellar radii), respectively. The GRAVITY data show that the stellar flux contribution at 2.2 micron at the time of our observations in 2020 is much lower than predicted by the optically and geometrically thick dust torus model based on the VLTI/MIDI data taken in 2005 and 2007. We found a significant change in the near-infrared spectrum of WOH G64: while the (spectro)photometric data taken at 1--2.5 micron before 2003 show the spectrum of the central RSG with H2O absorption, the spectra and JHK' photometric data taken after 2016 are characterized by a monotonically rising continuum with very weak signatures of H2O. This spectral change likely took place between December 2009 and 2016. On the other hand, the mid-infrared spectrum obtained in 2022 with VLT/VISIR agrees well with the spectra obtained before 2007. The compact emission imaged with GRAVITY and the near-infrared spectral change suggest the formation of hot new dust close to the star, which gives rise to the monotonically rising near-infrared continuum and the high obscuration of the central star. The elongation of the emission may be due to the presence of a bipolar outflow or effects of an unseen companion.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA-IMF imaged 15 massive protoclusters down to a resolution of of 2 kau scales, identifying about 1000 star-forming cores. The mass and luminosity of these cores, which are fundamental physical characteristics, are difficult to determine, a problem greatly exacerbated at the distances >2 kpc of ALMA-IMF protoclusters. We combined new datasets and radiative transfer modeling to characterize these cores. We estimated their mass-averaged temperature and the masses these estimates imply. For 1/6 of the sample, we measured the bolometric luminosities, implementing deblending corrections when necessary. We used spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis obtained with the PPMAP Bayesian procedure, which aims to preserve the best angular resolution of the input data. We extrapolated the luminosity and dust temperature images provided by PPMAP at 2.5" resolution to estimate those of individual cores, which were identified at higher angular resolution. To do this, we applied approximate radiative transfer relationships between the luminosity of a protostar and the temperature of its surrounding envelope and between the external heating of prestellar cores and their temperatures. For the first time, we provide data-informed estimates of dust temperatures for 883 cores identified with ALMA-IMF: 17-31 K and 28-79 K (5th and 95th percentiles, up to 127 K) for the 617 prestellar and 266 protostellar cores, respectively. We also measured protostellar luminosities spanning 20-80 000 Lsun. For hot cores, we estimated systematically lower temperatures than studies based on complex organic molecules. We established a mass-luminosity evolutionary diagram, for the first time at the core spatial resolution and for a large sample of high-mass protostellar cores. The ALMA-IMF data favor a scenario in which protostars accrete their mass from a larger mass reservoir than their host cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of three new transiting giant planets orbiting TOI-6628, TOI-3837 and TOI-5027, and one new warm sub-Saturn orbiting TOI-2328, whose transits events were detected in the lightcurves of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \textbf{(TESS)} space mission. By combining TESS lightcurves with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations we confirm the planetary nature of the observed transits and radial velocity variations. TOI-6628~$b$ has a mass of 0.75$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.98$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and is orbiting a metal-rich star with a period of 18.18424$\pm{0.00001}$ days and an eccentricity of 0.667$\pm0.016$, making it one of the most eccentric orbits of all known warm giants. TOI-3837~$b$ has a mass of 0.59$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.96$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and orbits its host star every 11.88865$\pm$0.00003~days, with a moderate eccentricity of 0.198$^{+0.046}_{-0.058}$. With a mass of 2.01$\pm$0.13~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.99$^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ $R_J$, TOI-5027~$b$ orbits its host star in an eccentric orbit with $e$~=~0.395$^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ every 10.24368$\pm{0.00001}$~days. TOI-2328~$b$ is a Saturn-like planet with a mass of 0.16$\pm$0.02~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.89$\pm$0.04~$R_J$, orbiting its host star in a nearly circular orbit with $e$~=~0.057$^{+0.046}_{-0.029}$ at an orbital period of 17.10197$\pm{0.00001}$ days. All four planets have orbital periods above 10 days, and our planet interior structure models are consistsent a rocky-icy core with a H/He envelope, providing evidence supporting the core accretion model of planet formation for this kind of planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric studies are essential for elucidating the formation history, evolutionary processes, and atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets. High-resolution transmission spectroscopy offers the advantage of detecting subtle variations in stellar spectral profiles, thereby enabling the identification of the sources of observed signals. In this study, we present the transmission spectra of the exoplanet WASP-77Ab, a hot Jupiter with a 1.36-day orbital period around a G8 host star with $V=11.29$ mag. These observations were conducted using the high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope over three transit events. We analyze the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for WASP-77A and determine a projected spin-orbit angle of ${\lambda = 16.131^{\circ}}^{+2.106}_{-2.324}$, indicating that the planet's orbit is nearly aligned. Following the generation of transmission spectra for the three nights, we model and correct for center-to-limb variation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effects. In the residual transmission spectra, we detect H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and CaII H with a significance exceeding 3.5$\sigma$. After applying 0.1-0.5 Å masks to the cores of these lines to mitigate stellar contamination, all them still shows visible absorptions although not significant, suggesting at least partial planet contribution to them. Therefore, we are yet unable to confirm or reject the planetary origin of these spectral signals based on the current data set. Further investigation of WASP-77Ab's atmosphere, particularly in areas beyond the terminator region, is essential to illuminate the planet's two-dimensional atmospheric structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time, to be conducted with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Solar System by providing an unprecedented wealth of data on various objects, including the elusive interstellar objects (ISOs). Detecting and classifying ISOs is crucial for studying the composition and diversity of materials from other planetary systems. However, the rarity and brief observation windows of ISOs, coupled with the vast quantities of data to be generated by LSST, create significant challenges for their identification and classification. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning algorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We demonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in accurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects. RF analysis shows that many derived Digest2 values are more important than direct observables in classifying ISOs from the LSST tracklets. The GBM model achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 0.9987, 0.9986, and 0.9987, respectively. These findings lay the foundation for the development of an efficient and robust automated system for ISO discovery using LSST data, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the materials and processes that shape planetary systems beyond our own. The integration of our proposed machine learning approach into the LSST data processing pipeline will optimize the survey's potential for identifying these rare and valuable objects, enabling timely follow-up observations and further characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs) can be a viable solution to the dark matter problem. The scalar field associated with ALPs, coupled to the electromagnetic field, acts as an active birefringent medium, altering the polarisation properties of light through which it propagates. In particular, oscillations of the axionic field induce monochromatic variations of the plane of linearly polarised radiation of astrophysical signals. The radio emission of millisecond pulsars provides an excellent tool to search for such manifestations, given their high fractional linear polarisation and negligible fluctuations of their polarisation properties. We have searched for the evidence of ALPs in the polarimetry measurements of pulsars collected and preprocessed for the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) campaign. Focusing on the twelve brightest sources in linear polarisation, we searched for an astrophysical signal from axions using both frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. For the frequentist analysis, which uses Lomb-Scargle periodograms at its core, no statistically significant signal has been found. The model used for the Bayesian analysis has been adjusted to accommodate multiple deterministic systematics that may be present in the data. A statistically significant signal has been found in the dataset of multiple pulsars with common frequency between $10^{-8}$ Hz and $2\times10^{-8}$ Hz, which can most likely be explained by the residual Faraday rotation in the terrestrial ionosphere. Strong bounds on the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$, in the same ballpark as other searches, have been obtained in the mass range between $6\times10^{-24}$ eV and $5\times10^{-21}$ eV. We conclude by discussing problems that can limit the sensitivity of our search for ultra-light axions in the polarimetry data of pulsars, and possible ways to resolve them.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution observations at millimeter (mm) and sub-mm reveal a diverse spatial distribution for sub-pc scale dense cores within star-forming regions, ranging from clustered to aligned arrangements. To address the increasing volume of observational and simulation data, we introduce "alignment parameters" as a quantitative and reproducible method to automatically assess core alignment. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of these parameters by applying them to artificial test clumps and comparing the results with labels from visual inspection. A threshold value is then proposed to differentiate between "clustered" and "aligned" categories. Subsequently, we apply these parameters to dense cores identified from a sample of ALMA 1.3 mm dust continuum images in high-mass star-forming regions. Analysis exploring correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties rules out the presence of moderate or strong correlation, indicating that clump properties do not appear to strongly influence the outcome of fragmentation. One possible explanation for this is that the fragmentation process is chaotic, meaning that small variations in initial conditions can lead to significant differences in fragmentation outcomes, thus obscuring any direct link between clump properties and core alignment/distribution.
#### LAMOST J171013+532646: a detached short-period non-eclipsing hot subdwarf + white dwarf binary

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of LAMOST J171013.211+532646.04 (hereafter J1710), a binary system comprising a hot subdwarf B star (sdB) and a white dwarf (WD) companion. Multi-epoch spectroscopy reveals an orbital period of 109.20279 minutes, consistent with TESS and ZTF photometric data, marking it as the sixth detached system known to harbor a WD companion with a period less than two hours. J1710 is remarkably close to Earth, situated at a distance of only \(350.68^{+4.20}_{-4.21} \, \mathrm{pc}\), with a GAIA G-band magnitude of 12.59, rendering it conducive for continuous observations. The spectral temperature is around 25164 K, in agreement with SED fitting results (\(25301^{+839}_{-743} \, \mathrm{K}\)). The TESS light curve displays ellipsoidal variation and Doppler beaming without eclipsing features. Through fitting the TESS light curve using the Wilson-Devinney code, we determined the masses for the sdB (\(M_1 = 0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}\)) and the compact object (\(M_2 = 0.54^{+0.10}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}\)), with the compact object likely being a WD. Furthermore, MESA models suggest that the sdB, with a helium core mass of 0.431 \(M_{\odot}\) and a hydrogen envelope mass of \(1.3 \times 10^{-3}\, M_{\odot}\), is in the early helium main-sequence phase. The MESA binary evolution shows that the J1710 system is expected to evolve into a double white dwarf system, making it an important source of low-frequency gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The Taurus region is one of the most extensively studied star-forming regions. Surveys indicate that the young stars in this region are comprised of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that cluster in groups associated with the molecular cloud (Grouped Young Stellar Objects, GYSOs), and some older ones that are sparsely distributed throughout the region (Distributed Young Stellar Objects, DYSOs). To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs ($\le$5 Myr) and the DYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this direction. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we identified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs and DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire region. Subsequently, we calculated the ages of the sample based on their proximity to the local bubble. The age versus Distance to the Local Bubble ($D_{\rm LB}$) relationship for the DYSOs shows a clear trend: the farther they are from the Local Bubble, the younger they are, which is consistent with the supernovae-driven formation scenario of the Local Bubble. The GYSOs also exhibit a mild age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ trend. However, they are significantly younger and are mostly confined to distances of 120 to 220 pc. Considering their distribution in the age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ space is well separated from the older DYSOs, they may also be products of the Local Bubble but formed in more recent and localized events.
#### Bayesian data analysis for sky-averaged 21-cm experiments with contamination from linearly polarised foreground

 - **Abstract**
 The precise measurement of the sky-averaged HI absorption signal between 50 and 200 MHz is the primary goal of global 21-cm cosmology. This measurement has the potential to unravel the underlying physics of cosmic structure formation and evolution during the Cosmic Dawn. It is, however, hindered by various non-smooth, frequency-dependent effects, whose structures resemble those of the signal. One such effect is the leakage of polarised foregrounds into the measured intensity signal: polarised foreground emission undergoes Faraday rotation as it passes through the magnetic fields of the interstellar medium, imprinting a chromatic structure in the relevant frequency range which complicates the extraction of the cosmological HI absorption feature. We investigate the effect of polarised Galactic foregrounds on extracting the global 21-cm signal from simulated data using REACH's data analysis pipeline; the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) is an experiment designed to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm HI signal from the early Universe using physically informed models. Using the REACH pipeline, we successfully recover an injected global 21-cm signal with an amplitude of approximately 0.16 K, centred between 80 and 120 MHz, achieving a low root-mean-square error (less than 30\% of the injected signal strength) in all the tested cases. This includes scenarios with simulated polarised Galactic diffuse emissions and polarised point source emissions, provided the overall polarisation fraction is below $\sim 3\%$. The linear mixing of contamination, caused by the superposition of multiple patches with varying strengths of Faraday rotation, produces patterns that are more distinct from the global signal. This distinction makes global signal recovery easier compared to contamination resulting from a single, slow oscillation pattern.

 - **Abstract**
 Triple star systems are critical for understanding stellar dynamics and compact objects in astrophysics, yet confirmed hierarchical triples identified via spectroscopy remain limited. In this study, we identified 23 triple systems by cross-matching the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalog with LAMOST DR10 spectroscopic data; 18 of them are new discoveries. For two well-observed triples, we performed radial velocity curve fitting and light curve analysis to determine their orbital parameters, with inner and outer periods of 1.26 days and 656 days for one triple, and 3.42 days and 422 days for the other. We compared the results with other studies. We also analyzed the radial velocities (RVs) of these 23 triples, revealing a range of $V$ from approximately 40~km~s$^{-1}$ to 210~km~s$^{-1}$. Due to spectral resolution and detection limitations, velocity differences below 45~km~s$^{-1}$ in binaries and below 90~km~s$^{-1}$ in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to detect. Consequently, our detection range for inner orbital periods is restricted to 0.2--20 days, with the highest efficiency for periods under 10 days. These findings underscore the advantage of spectroscopic observations for identifying triple systems with short inner orbital periods.

 - **Abstract**
 A multi-wavelength, multi-scale study of the Mon R2 hub-filament system (HFS) reveals a spiral structure, with the central hub containing more mass than its filaments. ALMA C$^{18}$O(1-0) emission reveals several accreting filaments connected to a molecular ring (size $\sim$0.18 pc $\times$ 0.26 pc). The molecular ring surrounds the infrared (IR) ring (size $\sim$0.12 pc $\times$ 0.16 pc), which is not usually observed. The IR ring encircles IR dark regions and a population of embedded near-IR sources, including the massive stars IRS 1 and IRS 2. ALMA HNC(3-2) line data reveal a mirrored B-shaped feature (extent $\sim$19000 AU $\times$ 39000 AU) toward the eastern part of the molecular ring, suggesting expansion at $\sim$2.25 km s$^{-1}$. Distinct HNC sub-structures in both redshifted and blueshifted velocity components are investigated toward the B-shaped feature. The presence of these braid-like substructures in each velocity component strongly suggests instability in photon-dominated regions. A dusty shell-like feature (extent $\sim$0.04 pc $\times$ 0.07 pc; mass $\sim$7 M$_{\odot}$) hosting IRS 1 is identified in the ALMA 1.14 mm continuum map, centered toward the base of the B-shaped feature. The IR and dense molecular rings are likely shaped by feedback from massive stars, driven by high pressure values between 10$^{-8}$-10$^{-10}$ dynes cm$^{-2}$, observed within a 1 pc range of the B0 ZAMS star powering the ultracompact HII region. Overall, these outcomes support that the Mon R2 HFS transitioned from IR-quiet to IR-bright, driven by the interaction between gas accretion and feedback from massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Discoveries of giant planet candidates orbiting white dwarf stars and the demonstrated capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope bring the possibility of detecting rocky planets in the habitable zones of white dwarfs into pertinent focus. We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the habitable zone of two different types of stars - a 5000 K white dwarf and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 with a similar effective temperature - and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously-rotating white dwarf planet's global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously-rotating planet orbiting Kepler-62, due to its much faster (10-hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultra-fast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent build-up of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting Kepler-62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their habitable zones, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux.
