 - **Abstract**
 Over the past two decades, an increasing number of transients have shown luminous activity at their explosion sites weeks to years before an interacting supernova (SN) is observed. For some objects, this pre-SN activity is typically linked to large-scale mass-loss events preceding core collapse, yet its triggering mechanism and the underlying explosion process remain uncertain. We present SN 2022mop, which was initially observed in August 2022, exhibiting nebular emission, including [O I], Mg I], and [Ca II], resembling the late-time (~200 days post-explosion) spectrum of a stripped-envelope SN (SESN) from a progenitor with M[ZAMS] < 18 Msun. SN 2022mop shows strong (~ 1 mag) repeating undulations in its light curve, suggesting late-time interaction. In mid-2024, the transient re-brightened for several months before a Type IIn SN (r[peak] = -18.2 mag) was observed in December 2024, closely resembling the evolution of SN 2009ip. By triangulating both transients using Pan-STARRS images, we determine that both transients are coincident within approximately 3 parsecs. Given the environment, the chance alignment of two isolated SNe is unlikely. We propose a merger-burst scenario: a compact object formed in 2022, is kicked into an eccentric orbit, interacts with its hydrogen-rich companion over subsequent months, and ultimately merges, triggering a Type IIn SN-like transient.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) environments around black holes (BHs) can influence their mergers through dynamical friction, causing gravitational wave (GW) dephasing during the inspiral phase. While this effect is well studied for collisionless dark matter (CDM), it remains unexplored for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) due to the typically low DM density in SIDM halo cores. In this work, we show that SIDM models with a massive force mediator can support dense enough DM spikes, significantly affecting BH mergers and producing a distinct GW dephasing. Using ${N}$-body simulations, we analyze GW dephasing in binary BH inspirals within CDM and SIDM spikes. By tracking the binary's motion in different SIDM environments, we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can distinguish DM profiles shaped by varying DM interaction strengths, revealing detailed properties of SIDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-stripped and Type Ibn supernovae (USSNe and SNe Ibn, respectively) are fast-evolving, hydrogen-poor transients that often show signs of interaction with dense circumstellar material (CSM). Wu & Fuller (2022) identify a mass range for helium-core stars in which they expand significantly during core oxygen/neon burning, resulting in extreme late-stage mass loss in tight binaries ($P\sim1-100\,{\rm days}$). Here we explore the resulting light curves from a subset of models from Wu & Fuller (2022) and find that in some cases they can exhibit two phases of shock cooling emission (SCE). The first SCE is attributed to the circumbinary material, and the second SCE is from the extended helium-burning envelope of the exploding star. Since SCE luminosity is roughly proportional to the initial radius of the emitting material, events that exhibit both phases of SCE provide the exciting opportunity of measuring both the extent of the CSM and the radius of the exploding star. These light curves are explored with both analytic arguments and numerical modeling, and from this we identify the parameter space of CSM mass, helium envelope mass, and nickel mass, for which the helium envelope SCE will be visible. We provide a qualitative comparison of these models to two fast-evolving, helium-rich transients, SN2019kbj and SN2019dge. The similarity between these events and our models demonstrates that this extreme binary mass loss mechanism may explain some SNe Ibn and USSNe.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the youngest stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), utilising a multi-wavelength approach. We analyse data spanning from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths, with the goal of enhancing our understanding of these clusters' physical properties, such as age, mass, and size. Our methodology includes a novel cluster detection procedure; it employs machine learning techniques for the accurate identification of these young clusters. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, using the Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis tool, plays a crucial role in deriving the clusters' key physical parameters. Our findings provide significant insights into the early stages of stellar and galactic evolution, particularly in dwarf galaxy environments, and contribute to the broader understanding of star formation and cluster evolution. For the 109 clusters in our sample younger than 5 Myr, we measure a positive correlation between cluster mass and the mass of the most massive star in the cluster. This study emphasises the importance of multi-wavelength observations in revealing the intricate properties of young stellar clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a high-sensitivity HI survey using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we identified an isolated HI cloud with a system velocity of ~127.0 km/s, which is associated with an optical galaxy KK153 in space. The HI gas of KK153 shows a typical disk-galaxy structure. Using the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, we obtained that the distance to KK153 is 2.0_{-0.8}^{+1.7} Mpc. Adopting such distance, we derived a stellar mass of 4.1_{-2.6}^{+10.0}*10^{5} Msun and a neutral gas fraction of 0.63, implying that KK153 is a gas-rich ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy in the Local Group or its outskirts. KK153 shows a cool (~200 K) and warm (~7400 K) two-phase neutral medium. The g-r color distribution of KK153 suggests that new stars are mostly forming in its inner disk. The dynamical mass of KK153 is 6.9_{-3.0}^{+5.5}*10^{7} Msun, which is about 60 times larger than its baryonic matter. Detection of such a low-mass and gas-rich halo poses a challenge to the theory of cosmic reionization.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform spherically symmetric simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the aid of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) which interact with photons and redistribute energy within supernova matter. We explore a wide ALP parameter space that includes MeV-scale ALP mass $m_{\,a}$ and the ALP-photon coupling constant $g_{\,a \gamma} \sim 10^{\,-10} \, \rm{GeV}^{\,-1}$ , employing three progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass of $11.2\,M_\odot$, $20.0\,M_\odot$, and $25.0\,M_\odot$. We find a general trend that, given $m_{\,a}\lesssim 300\,$MeV, heavier ALPs are favorable for the shock wave to be successfully revived, aiding the onset of the neutrino-driven explosion. However, if ALPs are heavier than $\sim 400\,$MeV, the explosion is failed or weaker than that for the models with smaller $m_{\,a}$, because of an insufficient temperature inside the supernova core to produce heavy ALPs. The maximum temperature in the core depends on the initial progenitor structure. Our simulations indicate that the high-temperature environment in the collapsing core of massive progenitors leads to a significant impact of ALPs on the explodability.
#### Multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry Study of Emission and Absorption in the Two-Sided Jets of NGC 3998

 - **Abstract**
 We present the multi-frequency, multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) study of the two-sided jets in the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 3998, where physical properties of the jets on parsec scales remain poorly understood. Using Very Long Baseline Array data observed at 1.4, 1.7, 2.3, and 5 GHz, we detect symmetric twin jets aligned along the north-south direction, with a total extent of $\sim 5.3$ pc. Notably, the position angle of the pc-scale jets differs by $26^\circ$-$30^\circ$ from that of the kpc-scale jets, suggesting the possibility of jet precession. Based on the frequency-dependent core shift and north/south jet brightness ratio, we identify the northern jet as the approaching jet and the southern jet as the counter-jet. Measurements of the radial intensity profile on both sides indicate a change in the counter-jet emission from rapid fading to a slower decline at 1.4, 1.7 and 2.3 GHz. Spectral analysis shows that the approaching jet exhibits an optically thin spectrum, while the counter-jet is dominated by an optically thick, inverted spectrum. These findings tentatively suggest free-free absorption in NGC 3998, which should be verified in future studies. Finally, our observations also reveal a flat-spectrum VLBI core, showing significant radio variability that is likely linked to a jet ejection event.
#### Magnetic field properties of the SNR HB 9

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to study the polarization and magnetic field properties of the SNR HB 9 using new 21-cm continuum cube data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio telescope (FAST). We computed the Faraday depth at 21 cm, and re-analyzed the rotation measures (RMs) of HB 9 using in addition Effelsberg 2695-MHz and Urumqi 4800-MHz polarization data. FAST total-intensity images of two subbands are decomposed into components of multiple angular scales to check spectral-index variation via temperature versus temperature plots (TT-plots). The filamentary emission has a spectral index ($S\sim\nu^{\alpha}$) of $\alpha=-$0.52, corresponding to freshly accelerated relativistic electrons. The diffuse emission has a steeper spectrum of $\alpha=-$0.63, corresponding to confined electrons that are no longer accelerated. The FAST detected 1385-MHz polarized emission might come from a thin layer in the outer envelope of the shells, with a Faraday depth of 4-28 rad m$^{-2}$ from the Faraday rotation synthesis result. The RMs derived from the Effelsberg 2695-MHz and Urumqi 4800-MHz polarization data show about 70 rad m$^{-2}$ in the eastern and northern shell, and 124 rad m$^{-2}$ in the inner and southern patches. The regular magnetic field is about 5$-$8 $\mu$G over the remnant. The northern shell shows depolarization at 2695 MHz relative to the 4800-MHz polarization data, indicating an additional random magnetic field of 12 $\mu$G on the scale of 0.6 pc. The shock wave might have entered the dense gas environment in the northern-shell region and has driven turbulence to cause depolarization at 2695 MHz.

 - **Abstract**
 A planet's spectrum is dynamic and only represents a time-dependent snapshot of its properties. Changing atmospheric conditions due to climate and weather patterns, particularly variation in cloud cover, can significantly affect the spectrum in ways that complicate the understanding of a planet's baseline atmospheric properties. Variable cloud cover and cloud properties affect the detectability of atmospheric constituents, and also greatly influence the radiative transfer that determines a planet's spectrum. This has considerable implications for direct imaging observations of potentially habitable exoplanets and thus it is critical to study and characterize the effects of clouds on their spectra. Clouds have been extensively modeled before and their effects have been incorporated across climate frameworks spanning a spectrum of complexity. Given the challenges associated with modeling clouds, we adopt a novel approach in this work to study the effects of clouds by using real-time cloud data from Earth observations. Treating Earth as an exoplanet and using detailed observations from the MERRA 2 data collection, we quantify the effects of cloud variability on the spectrum as well as on the detectability of atmospheric constituents, specifically biomarkers like O2, O3 and H2O. The coverage and vertical position of clouds significantly affects the SNRs of these gases and subsequently their detectability in exo-Earth atmospheres. Moreover, we show that variations in the amount of cloud cover will potentially confound efforts to retrieve a stable baseline atmosphere for a planet. This work has important applications to future direct-imaging missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO).
#### Tomography of the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud with Velocity Features in C$_2$H $N=1-0$ spectra: A Pilot Study of Coherent Sub-structures

 - **Abstract**
 The C$_2$H $N=1-0$ transition was used to investigate the possible line of sight sub-structures from the dense and optically thick in $^{13}$CO $J=1-0$ regions in the Ophiuchus star forming molecular cloud. With a 0.2 K or lower noise, multi-peak spectra were obtained and then used for identifying sub-structures. There are clues, e.g., the core velocity dispersion remains unchanged with the increasing scale that this cloud has a mild thickness in the line of sight direction and a large amount of overlapping CO cores, as expected, at least two coherent layers have been found. The integrated intensity maps of these two layers are different in shape and morphology. Inferred from the point velocity dispersion, one sub-structure with a thickness of $\sim 1$ pc was found, while other substructures were more likely to be fragments.
#### Tiny-Scale Properties within the Interstellar Medium towards PSR J1644$-$4559: I. Observational Evidence of Turbulence-induced Tiny Scale Atomic Structures

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated HI absorption toward a single pulsar, PSR J1644$-$4559, and its variability over timescales from days to years, using Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope. Our 19 epochs of spectral observations, spanning 1.2 years with intervals as short as 1 day, provide the most comprehensive cadence coverage for monitoring HI absorption to date. We identified two significant detections of tiny-scale atomic structure (TSAS) with spatial scales ranging from a lower limit of $\sim$11 au to an upper limit of 165 au, both exhibiting integrated signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 5.0. We find a relationship between linear size and optical depth variation in the cold neutral medium (CNM) component hosting the TSAS, described by a power-law relationship, $\Delta\tau_{\rm int} = \Delta\tau_0 (\Delta L)^{(\alpha-2)/2}$, with $\alpha = 4.1 \pm 0.4$. This is the first observational evidence explicitly connecting TSAS to turbulence in CNM. This power-law index is significantly steeper than previously reported values for the CNM, where $\alpha$ ranges from 2.3 to 2.9, but similar to those observed in the warm ionized gas. Additionally, we observe no significant variation in $\alpha$ across the entire range of spatial scales traced in our study, indicating that turbulence may be cascading down and dissipating at smaller scales. While there is no precise proper motion measurement for this pulsar, our estimates for the turbulence dissipation in the CNM place the lower and upper limits at less than 0.03 au and 0.4 au, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the structure and kinematics of cores associated with the regions of massive star and star cluster formation are necessary for constructing scenario for the evolution of these objects. We analyzed spectral maps of the massive cores of G012.418+00.506, G326.472+00.888, G328.567--00.535, G335.586--00.289 and G343.127--00.063 from the MALT90 survey in the HCO$^+$(1--0) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0) lines. The cores are at different stages of evolution and have signs of contraction. By fitting spectral maps calculated within the framework of a spherically symmetric model into the observed ones, the parameters of the radial profiles of density, turbulent velocity and contraction velocity were calculated. The power-law index of the density decay with distance from the center varies in the range of $\sim 1.5-2.8$. The lowest value is obtained for the core of G326.472+00.888 without internal sources. The contraction velocity in all cores depends weakly on the distance from the center, decreasing with an index of $\sim 0.1$, which differs from the free-fall mode. There are indications of rotation for the cores of G328.567--00.535 and G335.586--00.289. Analysis of $^{13}$CO(2--1) data from the SEDIGISM survey for the regions G012.418+00.506, G335.586--00.289, and G343.127--00.063 revealed motions from the surrounding gas toward the cores. The results obtained indicate that the massive cores under consideration interact with their environment and are apparently in a state of global collapse.t the massive cores under consideration interact with their environment and are apparently in a state of global collapse.
