#### Extended Linearity in the High-Order Wavefront Sensor for the Roman Coronagraph

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Coronagraphic Instrument (CGI) on the Roman Space Telescope aims for unprecedented contrast for direct imaging of exoplanets, serving as a critical tech demo for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This requires advanced wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C), including pair-wise (PW) probing for electric field estimation in the focal plane. Optimizing PW probe designs is vital to enhance performance and reduce overheads. Aims. We investigate different probe designs for PW probing in the context of Roman CGI. We compare classic sinc-sinc-sine probes, previously introduced single-actuator probes, and newly proposed sharp sinc probes in terms of effectiveness in focal-plane modulation, resilience to non-linearities, and overall impact on convergence and contrast. Methods. We conducted experiments on the THD2 testbed, configured to emulate Roman CGI with a custom Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph. We evaluated the three probe designs through WFS&C experiments using PW probing for estimation and electric field conjugation for wavefront correction. Simulations and hardware tests assessed contrast convergence and the impact of non-linear terms at varying probe amplitudes. We also explored low-flux scenarios to demonstrate the use of high-amplitude probes in reducing exposure times or closing the loop on faint targets. Results. Single-actuator probes emerged as the most effective, with faster convergence and reduced non-linear effects at high amplitudes. Sharp sinc probes performed moderately well but were less robust than single actuators. High-amplitude single-actuator probes showed advantages in dark-hole digging under low-flux, through faster iterations without significant degradation in contrast. The THD2 testbed, operating at contrasts analogous to Roman CGI, validated our results and underscored its role as a critical platform for advancing WFS&C techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 Organosulfur species are potential major carriers of sulfur in the interstellar medium, as well as interesting ingredients in prebiotic chemistry. The most fundamental question regarding these species is under which conditions they reside in the gas versus solid phase. Here, we characterize the thermal desorption kinetics, binding energies, and entrapment of the organosulfur methyl mercaptan (CH$_3$SH, or MeSH) in different ice environments, comparing them with those of methanol (CH$_3$OH, or MeOH) ices. The derived multi-layer (pure MeSH-MeSH) and sub-monolayer (layered MeSH-H$_2$O) binding energies are surprisingly similar, corresponding to snow line locations where the disk midplane temperature is ~105 K. In both H$_2$O-dominated and more realistic H$_2$O:CO$_2$-dominated ices, 100% of the MeSH is entrapped, almost exclusively desorbing at the molecular volcano desorption peak, indicating that MeSH is retained at the water snow line if initially mixed with water ice during formation. Additionally, the presence of MeSH in an ice mixture enhances the entrapment of CO$_2$ and MeOH (up to 100%) until the onset of volcano desorption; without MeSH, both desorb at their respective pure desorption temperatures and also co-desorb with water. Compared to MeOH, MeSH binds less well to water, explaining why MeSH escapes during water ice crystallization rather than co-desorbing with water. These results show the larger relative size of MeSH compared to MeOH significantly impacts its ability to bind to water and its entrapment efficiency. Therefore, molecular size plays an important role in the adsorption and retention of S-bearing organics and, in turn, other volatiles in ices.

 - **Abstract**
 The planetary nebula NGC 6720, also known as the ``Ring Nebula", is one of the most iconic examples of nearby planetary nebulae whose morphologies present a challenge to our theoretical understanding of the processes that govern the deaths of most stars in the Universe that evolve on a Hubble time. We present new imaging with JWST of the central star of this planetary nebula (CSPN) and its close vicinity, in the near- to mid-IR wavelength range. We find the presence of a dust cloud around the CSPN, both from the spectral energy distribution at wavelengths >~5 micron, as well as radially-extended emission in the 7.7, 10 and 11.3 micron images. From modeling of these data, we infer that the CSPN has a luminosity of 310 Lsun and is surrounded by a dust cloud with a size of ~2600 au, consisting of relatively small amorphous silicate dust grains (radius ~0.01 micron) with a total mass of 1.9 x 10^(-6) M_earth. However, our best-fit model shows a significant lack of extended emission at 7.7 micron -- we show that such emission can arise from a smaller (7.3 x 10^(-7) M_earth) but uncertain mass of (stochastically-heated) ionized PAHs. However, the same energetic radiation also rapidly destroys PAH molecules, suggesting that these are most likely being continuously replenished, via the outgassing of cometary bodies and/or the collisional grinding of planetesimals. We also find significant photometric variability of the central source that could be due to the presence of a close dwarf companion of mass < ~0.1 Msun.
#### Planets in Globular Clusters?

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of planets around PSR~1257+12 suggests that planetary systems may be detected around the recycled pulsars found in globular clusters. Planetary systems in dense clusters have lifetimes to disruption due to perturbations by passing stars comparable to or shorter than the pulsar lifetime, and observations of planets in the cores of clusters may reveal planetary systems formally dynamically unstable on time scales short compared to the characteristic age, $\tau_c$, of the system. Planets formed around cluster pulsars will most likely be restricted to semi--major axis of $\sim 0.1-1.0\, AU$, while "scavenged" planets may be observed in wider orbits, with no stable systems expected in the densest clusters. Observation is most probable in the cluster rich high--density pre-core collapse clusters such as 47Tuc. Detection of planets around cluster pulsars can constrain planet formation mechanisms, in particular the effects of low metallicity on planet formation in disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the atomic-to-molecular transition is essential for understanding the evolution of interstellar medium. The linear edge of Taurus molecular cloud, clearly identified in the $^{13}$CO(1-0) intensity map, serves as an ideal site for investigating this transition. Utilizing the Arizona Radio Observatory Sub-Millimeter Telescope, we obtained mapping observations of CO(2-1), $^{13}$CO(2-1), and CO(3-2) across this linear edge. The intensity ratio between CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1) indicates a lower limit of the $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio of $54\pm 17$. Based on multi-transition observations of CO and $^{13}$CO, we performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fit of the physical properties across this edge using non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium analysis with the RADEX code, based on the Large velocity Gradient (LVG) assumption. The number density profile exhibits a pronounced jump coinciding with the H$_2$ infrared emission peak. The cold HI gas within the molecular cloud, manifested as HI-Narrow Self-Absorption (HINSA) features, is detected along the cloud edge. Our quantitative comparison with numerical simulations provides tentative evidence that shocks induced by colliding gas flows may contribute to the atomic-to-molecular phase transition observed along the linear edge.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs(CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M_sun yr-1, our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11 - 3.89 * 10-4 yr-1. In addition,delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05 - 2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological description of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and cosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed by a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described by the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution, as well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation through general relativity. There have always been open questions about the soundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have shown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the emergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White Paper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming decade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these challenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the measurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical confidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We also discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond traditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]
#### Quantifying the scale of star formation across the Perseus spiral arm using young clusters around Cas OB5

 - **Abstract**
 Cas OB5 is an OB association located at a distance of 2.5-3 kpc that intercepts the Perseus spiral arm. It carries a moderate amount of reddening ($A_V \sim$ 2-3 mag) and contains several well-known open clusters within its boundaries, such as King 12, NGC 7788, and NGC 7790. The availability of modern clustering algorithms, together with \textit{Gaia} DR3 kinematics and complementary spectroscopic data, makes it a suitable site for studies of Galactic structure. We seek to quantify the spatial scale of star formation in the spiral arms, using Cas OB5 as a pilot target before extending our study to more distant and extinguished regions of the Galaxy. We selected 129,695 candidate OBA stars in a 6x8 deg$^2$ region around Cas OB5. We applied a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting process to this sample to derive the physical parameters. Through this process, we found 56 379 OBA stars, which we then clustered using HDBSCAN. We identified 17 open clusters inside this area, four of which appear to form a coherent structure that we identify as Cas OB5. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that these clusters belong to two different age groups despite sharing a similar position and kinematics. Spectroscopic observations confirm the youth of NGC 7788 (10-15 Myr) compared to NGC 7790 ($110\pm15\:$Myr). We have determined a spatial scale for star formation of a few tens of pc to a few hundreds of pc, comparing the clustered to the diffuse population of Cas~OB5 across this part of the Perseus arm. A spectroscopic analysis was required to complement the clustering algorithm, so that we could separate younger OCs (tracers of the spiral arm) from older ones. These results highlight the need to combine these techniques to fully disentangle the Milky Way structure.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature and formation history of our Galaxy's largest and most enigmatic stellar cluster, known as Omega Centauri (ocen) remains debated. Here, we offer a novel approach to disentangling the complex stellar populations within ocen based on phylogenetics methodologies from evolutionary biology. These include the Gaussian Mixture Model and Neighbor-Joining clustering algorithms applied to a set of chemical abundances of ocen stellar members. Instead of using the classical approach in astronomy of grouping them into separate populations, we focused on how the stars are related to each other. In this way, we could identify stars that likely formed in globular clusters versus those originating from prolonged in-situ star formation and how these stars interconnect. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that ocen might be a nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way with a mass of about 10^9M_sun. Furthermore, we revealed the existence of a previously unidentified in-situ stellar population with a distinct chemical pattern unlike any known population found in the Milky Way to date. Our analysis of ocen is an example of the success of cross-disciplinary research and shows the vast potential of applying evolutionary biology tools to astronomical datasets, opening new avenues for understanding the chemical evolution of complex stellar systems.
#### Acoustic modes in M67 cluster stars trace deepening convective envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors. Frequency differences between overtone modes -- large separations -- probe stellar density, while differences between low-degree modes -- small separations -- probe the sound speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main sequence Sun-like stars, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterised by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and simply become proportional to large separations. Here, we present clear evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultra-deep regime that leads to the red giant branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.
#### Open cluster age calibration from colour-magnitude morphological indices using Gaia DR3 data

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters are crucial for understanding how stars evolve. Their colour-magnitude diagrams show the effects of stellar evolution of approximately coeval objects with the same chemical composition. Furthermore, the determination of their astrophysical parameters (age, distance, colour excess and metallicity) together with their spatial distribution provides information about the structure and the evolution of the Galaxy itself. Using data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 and 2MASS catalogues, we develop methodologies for characterizing open clusters. Precise membership lists, mean astrometric parameters and radii are obtained. Using photometric data from both data sources, we carried out new age calibrations that rely on morphological indices based on colour ($\Delta BR$) and magnitude ($\Delta G$) differences between the red clump and the turnoff for a sample of 34 open clusters with ages covering the interval $8.3 < \log[t({\rm yr})] < 9.9$. A set of age calibration functions based on \textit{Gaia} morphological age indices are determined for the first time. We demonstrate their accuracy, obtaining a mean residual of 0.06 dex in $\log[t(yr)]$. Our results also show that stellar evolution models tend to predict the difference $\Delta G$. However, they typically overestimate the difference $\Delta BR$ for objects younger than $\log[t({\rm yr})] = 8.8$.
