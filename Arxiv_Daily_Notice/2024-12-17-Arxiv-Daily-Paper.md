 - **Abstract**
 With the advent of time-domain astronomy and the game-changing next generation of telescopes, we have unprecedented opportunities to explore the most energetic events in our Universe through electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. These are elementary particles, which exist in three different flavors and change the latter as they propagate in the dense core of astrophysical sources as well as en route to Earth. To capitalize on existing and upcoming multi-messenger opportunities, it is crucial to understand: 1. the role of neutrinos in explosive transient sources as well as in the synthesis of the elements heavier than iron; 2. the impact of neutrino physics on the multi-messenger observables; 3. the information on the source physics carried by the detectable neutrino signal. In this review, the status of this exciting and fast-moving field is outlined, focusing on astrophysical sources linked to collapsing massive stars and neutron-star mergers. In light of the upcoming plethora of multi-messenger data, outstanding open issues concerning the optimization of multi-messenger detection strategies are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Broadband spectroscopic observations with high sensitivity provide an unbiased way to detect emissions of molecules in space. We present deep observations from ~ 105.8 GHz to 113.6 GHz toward 50 Galactic massive star-forming regions using IRAM 30-m millimeter telescope, with noise levels ranging from 6 to 29 at frequency channel spacing of 195 kHz, which corresponds to ~ 0.54 km/s at 110 GHz. Totally, 27 molecular species have been identified, of which 16 are complex organic molecules. The related parameters, such as peak temperature, integrated intensity, and line width of the identified molecular lines were obtained. The line widths of the chemically related molecules show strong positive correlations, suggesting they likely originate from similar gases within star-forming regions. This work highlights the fundamental properties of the detected molecular lines and offers a valuable dataset for further studies on the astrochemical evolution of molecules in massive star-forming cores.
#### Mass-transferring binary stars as progenitors of interacting hydrogen-free supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are H-poor transients produced at the end of the life of massive stars that previously lost their H-rich envelope. Their progenitors are thought to be donor stars in mass-transferring binary systems, which were stripped of their H-rich envelopes some $10^6$yr before core collapse. A subset of the stripped-envelope SNe exhibit spectral and photometric features indicative of interaction between their ejecta and nearby circumstellar material (CSM). We examine whether mass transfer during, or shortly before, core collapse in massive binary systems can produce the CSM inferred from the observations of interacting H-poor SNe. We select 44 models from a comprehensive grid of detailed binary evolution models in which the mass donors are H-free and explode while transferring mass to a main-sequence companion. We find that in these models, mass transfer starts less than $\sim20$kyr before, and often continues until the core collapse of the donor star. Up to $0.8M_\odot$ of H-free material are removed from the donor star during this phase, which may produce a He-rich circumbinary material. We explore plausible assumptions for its spatial distribution at the time of explosion. When assuming that the CSM accumulates in a circumbinary disk, we find qualitative agreement with the supernova and CSM properties inferred from observed Type Ibn SNe, and to a lesser extent with constraints from Type Icn SNe. We find that our mass transferring stripped envelope SN progenitor models may produce up to $\sim$10% of all stripped envelope supernovae. The binary channel proposed in this work can qualitatively account for the observed key properties and rate of interacting H-poor SNe. Models for the evolution of the circumbinary material and the spectral evolution of exploding progenitors from this channel are needed to further test its significance.
#### Deciphering the Soliton-Halo Relation in Fuzzy Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 Soliton cores at the center of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) halos provide a promising way to distinguish FDM from other dark matter models. However, the relation between solitons and their host halos remains contentious. Here, we rigorously examine this soliton-halo relation (SHR) using a rich set of cosmological simulations across various FDM particle masses, halo masses, and redshifts. We explicitly demonstrate thermal equilibrium between solitons and surrounding halo granules, energy equipartition within halos, and an FDM concentration-mass-nonisothermality relation. For each FDM halo, we confirm that its density profile outside the central soliton matches a collisionless N-body simulation from the same initial condition, serving as stringent numerical convergence tests. Our refined SHR agrees well with virialized halos in simulations, with a $1\sigma$ deviation of less than $30\%$. These findings not only reaffirm the SHR proposed by Schive et al. (2014) but also offer a more comprehensive understanding that extends its applicability. The simulation code GAMER is accessible at this https URL. A Python script for computing the theoretical SHR is available at this https URL.
#### On the Geometry of the Near-Core Magnetic Field in Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 It is well-known that the cores of massive stars sustain a stellar dynamo with a complex magnetic field configuration. However, the same cannot be said for the field's strength and geometry at the convective-radiative boundary, which are crucial when performing asteroseismic inference. In this Letter, we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a 7 solar mass mid-main sequence star, with particular attention given to the convective-radiative boundary in the near-core region. Our simulations reveal that the toroidal magnetic field is significantly stronger than the poloidal field in this region, contrary to recent assumptions. Moreover, the rotational shear layer, also important for asteroseismic inference, is specifically confined within the extent of the buoyancy frequency peak. These results, which are based on the inferred properties of HD 43317, have widespread implications for asteroseismic studies of rotation, mixing and magnetism in stars. While we expect our results to be broadly applicable across stars with similar buoyancy frequency profiles and stellar masses, we also expect the MHD parameters and the initial stellar rotation rate to impact the geometry of the field and differential rotation at the convective-radiative interface.
#### Passage of a Gamma-Ray Burst Through a Molecular Cloud: The Absorption of its Afterglow in the X-ray Wavelength Range
 - **Authors:** Aleksandr Nesterenok
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10021

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10021

 - **Abstract**
 We study the absorption of a gamma-ray burst afterglow in a dense molecular cloud in the X-ray wavelength range. We report the results of numerical simulations of the propagation of the gamma-ray burst radiation in the cloud for various gas densities, metallicities, and distances from the gamma-ray burst progenitor star and the cloud. We consider a sample of 45 gamma-ray bursts with known redshifts in which the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy is approximately equal to the value adopted in our numerical simulations. For these gamma-ray bursts, we have analyzed the Swift/XRT energy spectra of their afterglows at late times, $t \geq 4 \times 10^3$ s. It is shown that the hydrogen column densities estimated using the absorption model in which the ionization of metal ions is not taken into account and the solar metallicity is used are a factor of 1-3 smaller than the actual values - if the molecular cloud is located close to the gamma-ray burst progenitor star. If the gas-dust cloud is located at a distance of $R \geq 10$ pc from the source of the gamma-ray burst or the gas metallicity is $[M/H] \leq -1$, then the effect of the cloud ionization structure on the absorption of the afterglow is minor.
#### De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach

 - **Abstract**
 Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.
#### Africanus II. QuartiCal: calibrating radio interferometer data at scale using Numba and Dask

 - **Abstract**
 Calibration of radio interferometer data ought to be a solved problem; it has been an integral part of data reduction for some time. However, as larger, more sensitive radio interferometers are conceived and built, the calibration problem grows in both size and difficulty. The increasing size can be attributed to the fact that the data volume scales quadratically with the number of antennas in an array. Additionally, new instruments may have up to two orders of magnitude more channels than their predecessors. Simultaneously, increasing sensitivity is making calibration more challenging: low-level RFI and calibration artefacts (in the resulting images) which would previously have been subsumed by the noise may now limit dynamic range and, ultimately, the derived science. It is against this backdrop that we introduce QuartiCal: a new Python package implementing radio interferometric calibration routines. QuartiCal improves upon its predecessor, CubiCal, in terms of both flexibility and performance. Whilst the same mathematical framework - complex optimization using Wirtinger derivatives - is in use, the approach has been refined to support arbitrary length chains of parameterized gain terms. QuartiCal utilizes Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python, to express calibration as an embarrassingly parallel task graph. These task graphs can (with some constraints) be mapped onto a number of different hardware configurations, allowing QuartiCal to scale from running locally on consumer hardware to a distributed, cloud-based cluster. QuartiCal's qualitative behaviour is demonstrated using MeerKAT observations of PSR J2009-2026. These qualitative results are followed by an analysis of QuartiCal's performance in terms of wall time and memory footprint for a number of calibration scenarios and hardware configurations.
#### Africanus IV. The Stimela2 framework: scalable and reproducible workflows, from local to cloud compute

 - **Abstract**
 Stimela2 is a new-generation framework for developing data reduction workflows. It is designed for radio astronomy data but can be adapted for other data processing applications. Stimela2 aims at the middle ground between ease of development, human readability, and enabling robust, scalable and reproducible workflows. It represents workflows by linear, concise and intuitive YAML-format "recipes". Atomic data reduction tasks (binary executables, Python functions and code, and CASA tasks) are described by YAML-format "cab definitions" detailing each task's "schema" (inputs and outputs). Stimela2 provides a rich syntax for chaining tasks together, and encourages a high degree of modularity: recipes may be nested into other recipes, and configuration is cleanly separated from recipe logic. Tasks can be executed natively or in isolated environments using containerization technologies such as Apptainer. The container images are open-source and maintained through a companion package called cult-cargo. This enables the development of system-agnostic and fully reproducible workflows. Stimela2 facilitates the deployment of scalable, distributed workflows by interfacing with the Slurm scheduler and the Kubernetes API. The latter allows workflows to be readily deployed in the cloud. Previous papers in this series used Stimela2 as the underlying technology to run workflows on the AWS cloud. This paper presents an overview of Stimela2's design, architecture and use in the radio astronomy context.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the star-forming cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) had revealed a large population of pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates, characterised by Halpha excess emission in their photometry. However, without access to spectroscopy, the nature of these objects remained unclear. Using the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST, we studied a sample of these stars, with masses in the range ~0.9-1.8 Msun, effective temperatures in the range 4,500-8,000 K, and PMS ages between ~0.1 and 30 Myr. Here we present the first spectra of solar-mass PMS stars in the metal-poor SMC (Z=1/8 Zsun) and discuss the physical properties of ten representative sources with good signal-to-noise ratio. The observations indicate that even the oldest of these PMS candidates are still accreting gas with typical rates of ~10^{-8} Msun/yr for stars older than ~10 Myr, confirming their PMS nature. The spectra also reveal near-infrared excess and molecular hydrogen excitation lines consistent with the presence of discs around these stars. These findings suggest that in a low-metallicity environment circumstellar discs can live longer than previously thought.
