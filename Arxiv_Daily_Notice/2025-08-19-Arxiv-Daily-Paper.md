#### The End of the Road for Far-infrared Reddening Maps? Evidence for Reddening Errors Driven by Changes in PAH Abundance

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate correction for extinction by Galactic dust is essential for studying the extragalactic sky. In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to $E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH feature are a promising way to overcome this limitation of far-infrared emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift ($z \ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by $z \approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole can more easily reach $> 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM particle is $^>_\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.

 - **Abstract**
 Classifying variable stars is crucial for advancing our understanding of stellar evolution and dynamics. As large-scale surveys generate increasing volumes of light curve data, the demand for automated and reliable classification techniques continues to grow. Traditional methods often rely on manual feature extraction and selection, which can be labor-intensive and less effective for managing extensive datasets. In this study, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for classifying variable stars using raw light curve data and their known periods. Our approach eliminates the need for manual feature extraction and preselected preprocessing steps. By applying phase-folding and interpolation to structure the light curves, the model learns variability patterns critical for accurate classification. Trained and evaluated on the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) dataset, our model achieves an average accuracy of 90% and an F1 score of 0.86 across six well-known classes of variable stars. The CNN effectively handles the diverse shapes and sampling cadences of light curves, offering a robust, automated, data-driven solution for classifying variable stars. This automated, data-driven method provides a robust solution for classifying variable stars, enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets from both current and future sky surveys.
#### Scalable and robust wide-field facet calibration with LOFAR's longest baselines

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has successfully achieved sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging with high-band observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). However, the scalability of this work remains limited due to the need for manual intervention, poor calibration solutions for the Dutch LOFAR stations, and high computational costs. We address these issues by: (1) improving automated self-calibration using a signal-to-noise metric and a neural network for image artefact detection; (2) implementing a refined calibration strategy for the Dutch LOFAR stations; and (3) cutting computational costs by optimising the data processing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated processing strategy by reprocessing one previously reduced dataset and a new dataset from the ELAIS-N1 deep field, which features more severe ionospheric conditions. We find calibration artefacts across facet boundaries to be reduced with our improved automated calibration strategy and achieve a computational cost reduction of about a factor of 4 to 6 compared to previous work, where the exact factor depends on whether a single observation is processed or multiple observations of the same sky area are combined. Further optimisation and improved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this in the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an 8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep imaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\mu$Jy/beam. Furthermore, it also lays the foundation for a fully automated survey pipeline for sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging of the northern sky with LOFAR.
#### Investigating the Kinematics of Molecular Gas in Cometary Globule L1616

 - **Abstract**
 LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapsed globular clusters are ideal targets to explore the presence of stellar collision products. Here, we have studied seventeen FUV bright white dwarf members in the globular cluster NGC 362 using data obtained from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) mounted on AstroSat and from HST. Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV and optical data sets to characterize and determine the parameters of white dwarfs. Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K, 0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of the companions (low-mass main-sequence stars) are 3500 - 3750 K, 0.150 - 0.234 Rsun,0.003 - 0.01 Lsun, and 0.14 - 0.24 Msun, respectively. The three binary systems (WD-MS), along with the massive WDs may have formed through dynamical processes that occurred during the core collapse of the cluster. This is the first evidence of a massive WD formation in a core-collapsed cluster, which is the missing link in the formation of a fast radio burst (FRB) progenitor in a globular cluster. This study provides evidence that NGC 362 hosts stellar systems that may evolve into exotic stars such as Type Ia supernovae, and/or FRBs in the future. *This is paper VI of the Globular Cluster UVIT Legacy Survey.
#### Type IIb Supernova Progenitors in 3D: Variability and Episodic Mass Loss revealed by Radiation-Hydrodynamics Simulations

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12486

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12486

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first 3D Radiation-Hydrodynamics simulations of partially-stripped ($M_\mathrm{core}\sim10M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{env}\sim0.1-1M_\odot$) Yellow Supergiant ($L\sim10^5$, $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx5000-8000$K) envelopes, constructed with Athena++. These envelope models represent the progenitors of Type IIb supernovae (SNe-IIb), which have lost a substantial fraction of their H-rich envelope before undergoing core-collapse. The luminosity-to-mass ratio is high in these extended envelopes, and convection is strongly driven by Hydrogen and Helium opacity peaks. This surface convection, coupled with changes in the opacity, sustains large-amplitude low-azimuthal-order radial pulsations, creating order-of-magnitude variability in the stellar luminosity on a timescale of tens of days. If persistent prior to a SN-IIb, these variations could herald the upcoming explosion. Supersonic fluid motions across the outer layers of the star lead to both successful and failed mass ejection events, which shape the circumstellar environment and drive episodic mass loss ($\sim10^{-6}-10^{-5}M_\odot/$yr, in outbursts). The resulting 3D gas distribution in the outer atmosphere, responsible for early-time supernova shock-breakout and shock-cooling emission, shows orders-of-magnitude fluctuations in both space and time at any given radial location. This intrinsically complex halo of bound and unbound material complicates predictions for early SN-IIb lightcurves relative to spherically-symmetric models. However, it does provide a natural, self-consistent explanation for the presence and diversity of dense circumstellar material observed or inferred around pulsating evolved stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden transients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\sim 10 \ \rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfvén and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.
#### A Tale of Two Sightlines: Comparison of Hydrocarbon Dust Absorption Bands toward Cygnus OB2-12 and the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.
#### Runaway stars and the Galactic supernova remnant landscape: non-thermal emission and observational evidence

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A significant fraction (~30%) of massive stars in our Galaxy are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium, which strongly governs their location at the time they end their lives, e.g. die as a supernova and give birth to a supernova remnant (SNR). These dead stellar environments accelerate particles, emitting by non-thermal mechanisms up to the TeV range, and they are considered as a major contributor to the very-high-energy band of the local cosmic-ray spectrum. Aims. This study investigates the effect of the runaway motion of supernova progenitors on the spatial distribution of SNRs in the Milky Way and how this influences the deduced properties of the population. Methods. We construct Galactic populations of SNRs by Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account the bulk motion and the evolution history of their progenitor stars once ejected from their parent clusters. The gamma-ray domain emission of each population is then calculated, to be compared with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic Plane Survey. Results. We find that including the runaway motion of supernova progenitors strongly modifies the detectability of the simulated emission of their remnants in the very-high-energy band. Particularly, our best fit model using a Reid Milky Way model for core-collapse supernova progenitors requires 33% of massive runaway stars, which is close to the known fraction of runaway high-mass stars, to be in accordance with the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey data. Conclusions. Our results show that the runaway nature of supernova progenitors must be taken into account in the study of the Galactic population of SNRs within the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the forthcoming Galactic Plane Survey of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as it is a governing factor of the detectability of non-thermal emission of their subsequent SNRs.
#### Observational Analysis of Multi-thermal Counter-streaming Flows in a Forming Filament and Their Relationship with Local Heating at Filament Footpoints

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we investigated the nature and origin of counter-streaming flows within a forming active region filament. The ever-present counter-streaming flows observed within the filament are identified as interleaved unidirectional mass flows in opposing directions occurring in neighboring threads. Multi-wavelength observations corroborate the multi-thermal nature of these counter-streaming flows: the cool H$\alpha$ component flows at about 10--20 km s$^{-1}$, while the warm ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet components reach 40--70 km s$^{-1}$. The Si~{\sc iv} 1400~Å line reveals significant micro-turbulence in the filament's counter-streaming flows, with a nonthermal velocity width of 40 km s$^{-1}$. These multi-thermal flows emanate from compact brightenings at the filament's ends, manifesting as small-scale, collimated upflows at their nascent phase. They continuously inject both chromospheric and transition region plasma into the filament channel, thereby feeding the counter-streaming flows. At their base, the Si~{\sc iv} and C~{\sc ii} spectral lines show pronounced line broadening and intensity enhancements, indicating significant localized chromospheric heating. Additionally, numerous small-scale photospheric flux emergence and cancellation events, with magnitude of $10^{17}$~Mx, are detected near their base. We suggest such weak magnetic-field activities, possibly associated with unresolved magnetic reconnection events, drive these persistent upflows and localized footpoint heating. This work elucidates the multi-thermal origin of counter-streaming flows within a forming filament and provides evidence of localized chromospheric heating at the filament footpoints.
#### How many stars form in compact clusters in the local Milky Way?

 - **Abstract**
 Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$ 50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.
#### EP250207b is not a collapsar fast X-ray transient. Is it due to a compact object merger?

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources. Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.
