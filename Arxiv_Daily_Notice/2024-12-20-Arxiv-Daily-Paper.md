#### Montage and Radio Astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 The Montage Image Mosaic Engine, first released in 2002, has found applicability across the electromagnetic spectrum to support data processing and visualization. This broad applicability has come about through its design as an Open Source ANSI-C toolkit (and Python binary extensions), with independent components to perform each step in the creation of a mosaic and with support for all WCS extensions. This design enables easy integration into custom environments, workflows and pipelines, and is the principal reason for its long lifetime. Here we emphasize the growing use of Montage in radio astronomy (37 peer-reviewed papers since 2020), and will focus on three high-profile applications: (1) Analysis of observations made with SKA precursor experiments, such as MeerKAT and the Murchison Wide-field Array, (2) Faraday tomography of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which explores the structure of the local interstellar medium, and (3) Identification of fast radio bursts.
#### Revisiting the Suzaku spectrum of the Galactic SNR W 49 B: non-detection of iron K-shell charge exchange emission and refined ejecta mass ratios of iron-group elements

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the recombining plasma in several Galactic SNRs has been debated. A plausible mechanism would be a rapid cooling in the past, either by adiabatic or conductive process. A recent spectral study of W 49 B reported a possible charge exchange (CX) emission due to collisions between the shock-heated ejecta and external cold clouds, which could be a direct support for the conduction cooling scenario. However, a potentially large systematic uncertainty in the spectral analysis has not been examined. In this paper, we revisit the Suzaku spectrum of W 49 B with taking into account the systematic uncertainties in spectral codes and instrumental gain calibration. We find that the previously reported CX flux is fully attributable to dielectronic recombination satellite lines of high-shell transitions that are missing from the present version of the spectral codes. We also report refined Fe-group ejecta mass ratios, which, in comparison to those in the literatures, show a better agreement with theoretical expectations from nucleosynthesis models, either of Type Ia explosions or spherical core-collapse explosions.
#### Fermion-Boson Stars as Attractors in Fuzzy Dark Matter and Ideal Gas Dynamics

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13382

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13382

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) we study the core formation in the presence of an Ideal Gas (IG). Our analysis is based on the solution of the Schrödinger-Poisson-Euler system of equations that drives the evolution of FDM together with a compressible IG, both coupled through the gravitational potential they produce. Starting from random initial conditions for both FDM and IG, with dominant FDM, we study the evolution of the system until it forms a nearly relaxed, virialized and close to hydrostatic equilibrium core, surrounded by an envelope of the two components. We find that the core corresponds to Newtonian Fermion-Boson Stars (FBS). If the IG is used to model luminous matter, our results indicate that FBS behave as attractor core solutions of structure formation of FDM along with baryonic matter.
#### AutoKnots: Adaptive Knot Allocation for Spline Interpolation
 - **Authors:** Sandro D. P. Vitenti, Fernando de Simoni, Mariana Penna-Lima, Eduardo J. Barroso

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13423

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13423

 - **Abstract**
 In astrophysical and cosmological analyses, the increasing quality and volume of astronomical data demand efficient and precise computational tools. This work introduces a novel adaptive algorithm for automatic knots (AutoKnots) allocation in spline interpolation, designed to meet user-defined precision requirements. Unlike traditional methods that rely on manually configured knot distributions with numerous parameters, the proposed technique automatically determines the optimal number and placement of knots based on interpolation error criteria. This simplifies configuration, often requiring only a single parameter. The algorithm progressively improves the interpolation by adaptively sampling the function-to-be-approximated, $f(x)$, in regions where the interpolation error exceeds the desired threshold. All function evaluations contribute directly to the final approximation, ensuring efficiency. While each resampling step involves recomputing the interpolation table, this process is highly optimized and usually computationally negligible compared to the cost of evaluating $f(x)$. We show the algorithm's efficacy through a series of precision tests on different functions. However, the study underscores the necessity for caution when dealing with certain function types, notably those featuring plateaus. To address this challenge, a heuristic enhancement is incorporated, improving accuracy in flat regions. This algorithm has been extensively used and tested over the years. NumCosmo includes a comprehensive set of unit tests that rigorously evaluate the algorithm both directly and indirectly, underscoring its robustness and reliability. As a practical application, we compute the surface mass density $\Sigma(R)$ and the average surface mass density $\overline{\Sigma}(<R)$ for Navarro-Frenk-White and Hernquist halo density profiles, which provide analytical benchmarks.

#### Streaming Torque with Turbulent Diffusion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13448

 - **Abstract**
 Fast type-I migration of (proto)planets poses a challenging problem for the core accretion formation scenario. We found that the dust-induced ``Streaming Torque (ST)'' may slow down or even reverse the planet migration in \cite{Hou2024}. But in realistic protoplanetary disks, dust diffusion induced by gas turbulence may have important influences on ST. We perform linear analysis to investigate the effects of dust diffusion on ST. The dependence of ST on the dust diffusion may provide better constraints on the turbulence strength and the stopping time $\tau$. We derive the dispersion relation for all the wave modes in the two-fluid system. The dust diffusion will smooth the short-wavelength structure of the the quasi-drift mode and split it into two predominant D-drift modes with opposite directions. The outgoing D-drift mode will contribute to a negative torque on planets, particularly when $\tau \sim 0.1$, which slightly shifts the zero-torque turning point. We explore how ST depends on the regimes of aerodynamic drag, dust mass fraction and disk scale height. We compare the radial wavenumbers of D-drift modes under different formulations of dust diffusion and find qualitative agreement. In all cases, $\tau$ at the zero-torque turning point, which determines the direction of planetary migration, consistently remains on the order of $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to large pebble-sized dust grains. This suggests that rapid dust coagulation can inhibit the inward migration of planets, implying that weak gas turbulence may enhance the survival of protoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 The increasing population of objects in geostationary orbit has raised concerns about the potential risks posed by debris clouds resulting from fragmentation. The short-term evolution and associated hazards of debris generated by collisions in the geostationary region is investigated in this study. The initial distribution of two debris clouds is modeled using a single probability density this http URL combined distribution of the evolved clouds is determined by solving boundary value this http URL risks associated with these debris clouds are evaluated by calculating the instantaneous impact rate and cumulative collision this http URL probability of collisions with millimeter-sized fragments may increase to 1% within 36 hours, while the probability of collisions with fragments 5 cm or larger is approximately $10^{-5}$.These findings underscore the vulnerability of the geostationary region to space traffic accidents.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the existence and properties of open superclusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Utilizing Gaia-derived advanced astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze the member stars of various open clusters (OCs), deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered OC Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.
#### Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: IRAS16293E (Oph464)

 - **Abstract**
 Pre-stellar cores are the first steps in the process of star and planet formation. However, the dynamical and chemical evolution of pre-stellar cores is still not well understood. We aim at estimating the central density of the pre-stellar core IRAS16293E and at carrying out an inventory of molecular species towards the density peak of the core. We observed high-$J$ rotational transitions of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$, and several other molecular lines towards the dust emission peak using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope, and derived the density and temperature profiles of the core using far-infrared surface brightness maps from $Herschel$. The N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ lines were analysed by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Our best-fit core model consists in a static inner region, embedded in an infalling envelope with an inner radius of approximately 3000 au (21" at 141 pc). The observed high-J lines of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ (with critical densities greater than 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) turn out to be very sensitive to depletion; the present single-dish observations are best explained with no depletion of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ in the inner core. The N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratio that best reproduces our observations is 0.44, one of the largest observed to date in pre-stellar cores. Additionally, half of the molecules that we observed are deuterated isotopologues, confirming the high-level of deuteration towards this source. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ lines proved to be an excellent diagnostic of the chemical structure and dynamics of a pre-stellar core. Probing the physical conditions immediately before the protostellar collapse is a necessary reference for theoretical studies and simulations with the aim of understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation and the time scale of this process.
#### Components and anisotropy of 3D QFP waves during the early solar eruption

 - **Abstract**
 The propagation of disturbances in the solar atmosphere is inherently three dimensional (3D), yet comprehensive studies on the spatial structure and dynamics of 3D wavefronts are scarce. Here we conduct high resolution 3D numerical simulations to investigate filament eruptions, focusing particularly on the 3D structure and genesis of EUV waves. Our results demonstrate that the EUV wavefront forms a dome like configuration subdivided into three distinct zones. The foremost zone, preceding the flux rope, consists of fast-mode shock waves that heat the adjacent plasma. Adjacent to either side of the flux rope, the second zone contains expansion waves that cool the nearby plasma. The third zone, at the juncture of the first two, exhibits minimal disturbances. This anisotropic structure of the wavefront stems from the configuration and dynamics of the flux rope, which acts as a 3D piston during eruptions :compressing the plasma ahead to generate fast mode shocks and evacuating the plasma behind to induce expansion waves. This dynamic results in the observed anisotropic this http URL, with synthetic EUV images from simulation data, the EUV waves are observable in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 193 and 211 angstrom, which are identified as the fast mode shocks. The detection of EUV waves varies with the observational perspective: the face on view reveals EUV waves from the lower to the higher corona, whereas an edge on view uncovers these waves only in the higher corona.
