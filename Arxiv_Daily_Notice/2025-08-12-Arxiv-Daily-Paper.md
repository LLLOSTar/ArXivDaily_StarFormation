 - **Abstract**
 We present new photometric observations of the core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf occurred in M101, taken with the RC80 and BRC80 robotic telescopes in Hungary. The initial nickel mass from the late-phase bolometric light curve extending up to 400 days after explosion, is inferred as $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.046 \pm 0.007$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of the bolometric light curve with models from hydrodynamical simulations as well as semi-analytic radiative diffusion codes reveals a relatively low-mass ejecta of $M_{\rm ej} \lesssim 9$ M$_\odot$, contrary to SN~2017eaw, another H-rich core-collapse event, which had $M_{\rm ej} \gtrsim 15$ M$_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 The radiation physics of bright prompt optical emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a puzzle. Assuming that the GRB ejecta is structured, we investigated this issue by characterizing the ejecta as an ultra-relativistic uniform jet core surrounded by a mild-relativistic cocoon. The mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region can accelerate particles through the shear acceleration mechanism. Parameterizing the radial velocity profile of the MJC region with an exponential function and assuming a uniform magnetic field configuration, we show that the synchrotron radiation of the shear-accelerated electrons can produce a bright optical flash. Emission of the self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) process of the electron population can result in an X-ray excess and an extra MeV-GeV gamma-ray flash relative to the Band function component in the keV-MeV band, which is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core. Our model reasonably represents the extremely bright optical flash and spectral characteristics of GRBs 990123, 080319B, and 130427A. The inferred magnetic field strength of the MJC region is above $10^{5}$ G, potentially suggesting that the jets of these GRBs are highly magnetized.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar activity drives space weather, affecting Earth's magnetosphere and technological infrastructure, which makes accurate solar flare forecasting critical. Current space weather models under-utilize multi-modal solar data, lack iterative enhancement via expert knowledge, and rely heavily on human forecasters under the Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA) paradigm. Here we present the "Solar Activity AI Forecaster", a scalable dual data-model driven framework built on foundational models, integrating expert knowledge to autonomously replicate human forecasting tasks with quantifiable outputs. It is implemented in the OODA paradigm and comprises three modules: a Situational Perception Module that generates daily solar situation awareness maps by integrating multi-modal observations; In-Depth Analysis Tools that characterize key solar features (active regions, coronal holes, filaments); and a Flare Prediction Module that forecasts strong flares for the full solar disk and active regions. Executed within a few minutes, the model outperforms or matches human forecasters in generalization across multi-source data, forecast accuracy, and operational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for AI-based space weather forecasting, demonstrating AI's potential to enhance forecast accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way for autonomous operational forecasting systems.
#### The impact of organic hazes and graphite on the observation of CO2-rich sub-Neptune atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Many sub-Neptune and super-Earth exoplanets are expected to develop metal-enriched atmospheres due to atmospheric loss processes such as photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. Thermochemical equilibrium calculations predict that at high metallicity and a temperature range of 300-700 K, CO2 becomes the dominant carbon species, and graphite may be the thermodynamically favored condensate under low-pressure conditions. Building on prior laboratory findings that such environments yield organic haze rather than graphite, we measured the transmittance spectra of organic haze analogues and graphite samples, and computed their optical constants across the measured wavelength range from 0.4 to 25 {\mu}m. The organic haze exhibits strong vibrational absorption bands, notably at 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 {\mu}m, while graphite shows featureless broadband absorption. The derived optical constants of haze and graphite provide the first dataset for organic haze analogues formed in CO2-rich atmospheres and offer improved applicability over prior graphite data derived from bulk reflectance or ellipsometry. We implemented these optical constants into the Virga and PICASO cloud and radiative transfer models to simulate transit spectra for GJ 1214b. The synthetic spectra with organic hazes reproduce the muted spectral features in the NIR observed by Hubble and general trends observed by JWST for GJ 1214b, while graphite models yield flat spectra across the observed wavelengths. This suggests haze features may serve as observational markers of carbon-rich atmospheres, whereas graphite's opacity could lead to radius overestimation, offering a possible explanation for super-puff exoplanets. Our work supplies essential optical to infrared data for interpreting observations of CO2-rich exoplanet atmospheres.
#### Identification of OB associations using the LAMOST-Gaia OB star sample

 - **Abstract**
 OB associations, as an intermediate stage between Galactic clusters and field stars, play an important role in understanding the star formation process, early stellar evolution, and Galactic evolution. In this work, we construct a large sample of OB stars with 6D phase space parameters ($l, b, d, V_{\rm los}, pmra ,pmdec$) by combining the distances from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), radial velocities derived from low-resolution spectra of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and proper motions from the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 (DR3). This sample includes 19,933 OB stars, most of which are located within 6\,kpc of the Sun. Using 6D phase space parameters and friends-of-friends clustering algorithm, we identify 67 OB associations and 112 OB association candidates, among them, 49 OB associations and 107 OB association candidates are newly identified. The Galactic rotation curve derived using 67 OB association members is relatively flat in the range of Galactocentric distances 7$<$$R$$<$13\,kpc. The angular rotation velocity at solar Galactocentric distance of $R_\odot$ =8.34\,kpc is $\Omega_0$ = 29.05$\pm$0.55\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-1}$. The spatial distribution of the 67 OB associations indicates that they are mainly located at low Galactic latitudes and near spiral arms of the Milky Way. Additionally, we estimate the velocity dispersions and sizes of these 67 OB associations. Our results show that the velocity dispersions decrease as Galactocentric distances increase, while their sizes increase as Galactocentric distances increase.
#### Revisiting Two Decades of GRB Observations: Assessing Missed Very High-Energy Detections and Future Prospects

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are bright flashes of electromagnetic radiation originating from the core collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact objects. It has long been theorized that GRBs can emit very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays that can reach the TeV level. Although current-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., have been observing GRBs since 2002, the first detection of GRBs by IACTs occurred only 16 years later, in 2018, raising the question of why no detections were made during these years. We investigate all GRBs detected by the Swift Observatory with redshift measurements over the past two decades. Using the phenomenological relationship between X-ray and gamma rays and taking into consideration extragalactic background light absorption effects and instrument response functions, we search for any missed opportunities for GRBs that could have been detected by the three IACTs: H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, and present the best candidates. We find that the missing detections can be explained by the low rate of detectable GRBs at VHE, which we quantify as < 1 per year. We also find that with the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), this rate can increase to 4 per year.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Solar flux atlases observe the spatially integrated light from the Sun, treating it as a star. They are fundamental tools for gaining insight into the composition of the Sun and other stars, and are utilized as reference material for a wide range of solar applications such as stellar chemical abundances, atmospheric physics, stellar activity, and radial velocity signals. Aims. We provide a detailed comparison of solar activity in some of the well-known solar atlases against the new High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) Quiet Sun (QS) and measured activity (MA) atlases that are published, for the first time, in this work. Methods. Ten of the widely used individual spectral lines from each flux atlas were selected to compare solar activity using three methods: 1) Equivalent Widths 2) Activity number, a novel activity measure which we introduce in this work. 3) Bisectors and radial velocity. Results. The significantly smaller activity measured in the MA atlas compared to the other atlases, relative to the QS atlas, underscores the dominance of instrumental effects over solar activity in their impact on spectral lines, which cannot be corrected through simple line convolution to match resolutions of other atlases. Additionally, our investigation unexpectedly revealed a substantial intensity shift in the Ca ii H & K lines of other atlases compared to our HARPS-N atlases, likely caused by assumptions in normalisation techniques used in the early Kitt Peak atlases. Conclusions. With an average spot number of zero, our QS atlas is well suited to serve as an absolute benchmark atlas representative of solar minimum for the visible spectrum that other atlases can be compared against. Our recommendations are 1) publication of a detailed log along with the observations, to include exact dates and indications of solar activity...
