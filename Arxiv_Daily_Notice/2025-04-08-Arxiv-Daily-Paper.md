#### Ain't no resonance high enough: Core collapse in self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass

 - **Abstract**
 Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.

 - **Abstract**
 The Superconducting Cosmic Strings (SCS) are a special case of cosmic strings that have a core carrying a charged field. When SCS pass through magnetized regions, the charged particles in the string experience a Lorentz force, which can produce radiation on the entire electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation can inject energy into the surrounding plasma, resulting in a modification of the thermal and ionization evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and, subsequently, the global 21-cm signal. The signatures of SCS in the post-recombination era have been primarily studied in the low-frequency (radio) regime, which does not impact the state of the IGM. In this work, we study the effect of decaying SCS on the Dark Ages global 21-cm signal $(\delta T_b)$, considering both the ionizing and radio radiations. The Dark Ages signal can provide pristine cosmological information free from astrophysical uncertainties, as the universe was primarily homogeneous during this era in the absence of baryonic structure formation. Considering a change in the $\delta T_b$ at redshift $z\sim 89$ from the $\Lambda \rm CDM$ framework to be $5\,\rm mK$ and $15\,\rm mK$, we derive an upper bound on the loop current of cosmic string, $I\gtrsim 11.5\,\rm GeV$, and string tension, $G\mu_s\gtrsim 2.5\times 10^{-15}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy have opened new opportunities for studying multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs), particularly for newly discovered clusters in the inner Milky Way. While optical spectroscopy has traditionally played a primary role in detailed chemical abundance studies of GCs, the increasing discovery of GCs in highly reddened environments underscores the need for robust NIR spectroscopic methods. To evaluate the utility of high-resolution NIR spectroscopy for studying multiple stellar populations, we observed six stars in M5, a well-studied halo GC, using the recently commissioned IGRINS-2 spectrograph on the Gemini-North telescope. Our chemical abundance measurements in the NIR wavelength range show good agreement with those derived from high-resolution optical spectroscopy, with minor systematic offsets in elements such as Na and Mg. In addition, the measured chemical abundance ratios clearly reproduce the distinctive patterns of multiple stellar populations, including the Na-O anti-correlation. The ability of NIR spectroscopy to measure C, N, and O abundances with high precision further enhances its utility for studying chemical properties of stars and GCs. Our findings demonstrate that IGRINS-2 and similar instruments have significant potential to advance our understanding of GC formation, stellar chemical evolution, and the evolutionary history of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 XRISM has delivered one of its first light observations on N132D, the X-ray brightest supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Utilizing 193 ks of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy data, we conduct a comprehensive search for charge exchange emission. By incorporating a charge exchange model into our spectral analysis, we observe an improvement in the fits of two weak features at 2.41 keV and 2.63 keV. These features, with a combined significance of 99.6%, are consistent with transitions from highly ionized silicon ions in high Rydberg states, which are unique indicators of charge exchange. Our analysis constrains the charge exchange flux to no more than 4% of the total source flux within the 1.7-3.0 keV band, and places an upper limit on the charge exchange interaction velocity at 450 km/s. This result supports ongoing shock-cloud interactions within N132D and highlights the unique capabilities of XRISM to probe the complex physical processes at play.

 - **Abstract**
 The expansion structure of supernova remnants (SNRs) is important for understanding not only how heavy elements are distributed into space, but also how supernovae explode. The ejecta expansion structure of the young core-collapse SNR Cas A is investigated, with Doppler parameter mapping of the Fe-K complex by the Resolve microcalorimeter onboard the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, XRISM. It is found that the Fe ejecta are blueshifted in the southeast (SE) and redshifted in the northwest (NW), indicating an incomplete shell structure, similar to the intermediate mass elements (IMEs), such as Si and S. The Fe has a velocity shift of $\sim1400$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the NW and $\sim2160$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the SE region, with the error range of a few 100s km~s$^{-1}$. These values are consistent with those for the IMEs in the NW region, whereas larger than those for the IMEs in the SE region, although the large error region prevented us from concluding which component has significantly higher velocity. The line broadening is larger in the center with values of $\sim$2000--3000~km~s$^{-1}$, and smaller near the edges of the remnant. The radial profiles of the Doppler shift and broadening of the IMEs and Fe indicate that the Fe ejecta may expand asymmetrically as IME ejacta, although the large error regions do not allow us to conclude it. Moreover, we see little bulk Doppler broadening of the Fe lines in the northeastern jet region whereas the IME lines exhibit significant broadening. No such narrow lines are detected in the NW region. These findings suggest an asymmetric expansion of the ejecta potentially driven by large-scale asymmetries originating from the supernova explosion. This interpretation aligns with the large-scale asymmetries predicted by models of neutrino-driven supernova explosions.

 - **Abstract**
 Electromagnetic waves undergo modifications as they propagate through plasma. We present EMPI (ElectroMagnetic-wave Plasma Interaction), a three-dimensional numerical framework designed to simulate the interaction between radio signals and cold plasma. With input plasma density profiles, intrinsic radio signals, and the time and frequency resolutions of the telescope, the code synthesizes observed signals using first-principles calculations. EMPI is capable of modeling a wide range of plasma distributions, spanning analytically described smooth functions (e.g., Gaussian or exponential profiles), statistical models (e.g., turbulent screens), and discrete macroscopic structures like isolated plasma clumps, which are difficult to model both analytically and statistically. Validation tests demonstrate excellent agreement with established plasma propagation effects, such as dispersion, lensing, scintillation, and scattering. This code provides an efficient method for handling both analytical and statistical scenarios, bridging the gap between these descriptions. Thanks to its comprehensive capabilities, EMPI is particularly useful for studying radio sources with cosmological origin, especially pulse-like signals such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). As these signals travel through diverse and complex plasma environments across the universe, their properties are inevitably altered, resulting in observable changes. In this context, EMPI serves as a valuable tool for studying the propagation effects of these sources, helping to advance the understanding of their essence and the intervening plasma environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Quasar strong gravitational lenses are important tools for putting constraints on the dark matter distribution, dark energy contribution, and the Hubble-Lemaitre parameter. We aim to present a new supervised machine learning-based method to identify these lenses in large astrometric surveys. The Gaia Focused Product Release (FPR) GravLens catalogue is designed for the identification of multiply imaged quasars, as it provides astrometry and photometry of all sources in the field of 4.7 million quasars. Methods. Our new approach for automatically identifying four-image lens configurations in large catalogues is based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting classification algorithm. To train this supervised algorithm, we performed realistic simulations of lenses with four images that account for the statistical distribution of the morphology of the deflecting halos as measured in the EAGLE simulation. We identified the parameters discriminant for the classification and performed two different trainings, namely, with and without distance information. Results. The performances of this method on the simulated data are quite good, with a true positive rate and a true negative rate of about 99.99% and 99.84%, respectively. Our validation of the method on a small set of known quasar lenses demonstrates its efficiency, with 75% of known lenses being correctly identified. We applied our algorithm (both trainings) to more than 0.9 million quadruplets selected from the Gaia FPR GravLens catalogue. We derived a list of 1127 candidates with at least one score larger than 0.75, where each candidate has two scores -- one from the model trained with distance information and one from the model trained without distance information -- and including 201 very good candidates with both high scores.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing longitude-velocity diagrams (LVDs) in the CS(J=2-1) and H13CN(J=1-0) molecular lines from the internal release data of the ALMA Central-Molecular-Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) and in the 13CO (J=1-0) line from the Nobeyama Galactic-Centre (GC) survey, we identify six GC Arms as prominent straight LV ridges. In addition to the currently known Arms I to IV, we identify a new inner arm, Arm V, and further highlight the circum-nuclear disc (CND) as Arm VI. Integrated intensity maps of the Arms on the sky suggest that most of the Arms compose ring-like structures inclined from the Galactic plane. We determine the radii (curvatures) of the Arms using the velocity-gradient ($dv/dl$) method, assuming that the arms are rotating on circular orbits at a constant velocity of $\sim 150$ km/s. We show that Arms I and II compose the main ring structure of the CMZ with radii $\sim 100$--120 pc; Arm III is a dense arm 42 pc from the GC; Arm IV is a clear and narrow arm 20 pc from the GC; and Arm V is a faint, long arm of 8.2 pc radius. We show that the circum-nuclear disc (CND) composes the sixth arm, Arm VI, of radius $\sim 2.3$ pc associated with bifurcated spiral fins. We also discuss the association of the 20- and 50-km/s clouds with these Arms. The radii of the arms fall on an empirical relation $R\sim 630 (2/5)^N$ for $N=1$ (Arm I) to 6 (VI), suggesting either discrete rings or a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle $\sim 22^\circ$. The vertical full extent of the arm increases with radius and is represented by $z\sim 0.7 (R/1 {\rm pc})^{0.7}$ pc. The tilt angle of the arms from the Galactic plane, or the warping, increases rapidly toward the GC.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants (RSGs), as the descendants of OB-type stars and the progenitors of supernovae, provide crucial insights into the evolution of massive stars, particularly in binary systems. Previous studies show that the binary fraction of RSGs ($\approx$ 15% - 40%) is significantly lower than that of their predecessors ($\approx$ 50% - 70%). In this work, we investigate the binary fraction of RSGs with the recently selected largest samples of 4695 and 2097 RSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), respectively. The binary system with a hot companion (O-, B- and A-type star) is identified by detecting the ultraviolet (UV) excess in the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from ultraviolet to mid-infrared after subtracting the model SED of RSG since RSGs are very weak in the UV band. It is found that the lower limit of binarity is 30.2% $\pm$ 0.7% and 32.2% $\pm$ 1% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. If the sample is limited to luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} > 4.0$, the binary fraction becomes 26.6% $\pm$ 1.1% and 26.4% $\pm$ 1.7% in the LMC and SMC, respectively. The derived binary fraction is valid in the range of $\sim$ 2.3 < $\log P / [\text{d}]$ < $\sim$ 8. Our study suggests that roughly one-third of massive stars host a third companion within $\sim$ 30,000 AU. In addition, 15 RSGs are also identified as binary via HST/STIS spectra, and a handful of the binaries identified by the SED fitting are confirmed by their light curve and radial velocity dispersion. The stellar parameters of the companions, i.e. $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $R$, $L$ and log $g$, are calculated by model fitting.
#### The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Occurrence rates of Earth-like planets around very low-mass stars

 - **Abstract**
 Aims: Previous estimates of planet occurrence rates in the CARMENES survey indicated increased numbers of planets on short orbits for M dwarfs with masses below 0.34\,M$_\odot$. Here we focused on the lowest-mass stars in the survey, comprising 15 inactive targets with masses under 0.16\,M$_\odot$. Methods: To correct for detection biases, we determined detection sensitivity maps for individual targets and the entire sample. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated planet occurrence rates for orbital periods of 1\,d to 100\,d and minimum masses from 0.5\,M$_\oplus$ to 10\,M$_\oplus$. Results: The radial velocity (RV) data from CARMENES reveal four new planets around three stars in our sample, namely G~268--110\,b, G~261--6\,b, and G~192--15\,b and c. All three b planets have minimum masses of 1.03--1.52\,M$_\oplus$ and orbital periods of 1.43--5.45\,d, while G~192--15\,c is a 14.3\,M$_\oplus$ planet on a wide, eccentric orbit with $P \approx 1218$\,d and $e \approx 0.68$. Our occurrence rates suggest considerable dependencies with respect to stellar masses. For planets below 3\,M$_\oplus$ we found rates consistent with one planet per star across all investigated periods, but the rates decrease almost by an order of magnitude for larger planet masses up to 10\,M$_\oplus$. Compared to previous studies, low-mass stars tend to harbor more planets with $P <10$\,d. We also demonstrate that synthetic planet populations based on the standard core accretion scenario predict slightly more massive planets on wider orbits than observed. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that planet occurrence rates vary with stellar masses even among M dwarfs, as we found more planets with lower masses and on shorter orbits in our subsample of very low-mass stars compared to more massive M dwarfs. Therefore, we emphasize the need for additional differentiation in future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The epoch of reionization represents a major phase transition in cosmic history, during which the first luminous sources ionized the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the small-scale physics governing ionizing photon sinks - particularly the interplay between recombinations, photon propagation, and self-shielded regions - remains poorly understood. Accurately modeling these processes requires a framework that self-consistently links ionizing emissivity, the clumping factor, mean free path, and photoionization rate. In this work, we extend the photon-conserving semi-numerical framework, SCRIPT, by introducing a self-consistent sub-grid model that dynamically connects these quantities to the underlying density field, enabling a more realistic treatment of inhomogeneous recombinations and photon sinks. We validate our model against a comprehensive set of observational constraints, including the UV luminosity function from HST and JWST, CMB optical depth from Planck, and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements of the IGM temperature, photoionization rate, and mean free path. Our fiducial model also successfully reproduces Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations, reinforcing its ability to capture large-scale inhomogeneities in the reionization process. Notably, we demonstrate that traditionally independent parameters, such as the clumping factor and mean free path, are strongly correlated, with implications for the timing, morphology, and thermal evolution of reionization. Looking ahead, we will extend this framework to include machine learning-based parameter inference. With upcoming 21cm experiments poised to provide unprecedented insights, SCRIPT offers a powerful computational tool for interpreting high-redshift observations and refining our understanding of the last major phase transition in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Bipolar emerging flux regions (EFRs) form active regions (ARs) that generally evolve in a pre-existing magnetic environment in the solar atmosphere. Reconfiguration of the small- and large-scale magnetic connectivities is invoked to explain a plethora of energy release phenomena observed at the sites of EFRs. These include brightening events, surges, and jets, whose trigger and relationship are still unclear. In this context, we study the formation of a proto-spot in AR NOAA~11462 by analyzing spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic measurements taken by the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer along the Fe~I 630.2~nm and Ca~II 854.2~nm lines on April 17, 2012. We complement these high-resolution data with simultaneous SDO satellite observations. The proto-spot forms from magnetic flux emerged into the photosphere that coalesces following plasma flows in its surrounding. The chromospheric and higher atmosphere observations show that flux emergence occurs in a pre-existing magnetic environment, with small- and large-scale coronal arcades that seemingly shape the proto-spot formation in the upper atmospheric layers. In addition, in the chromosphere we observe an arch filament system and repeated intense brightening events and surges, likely due to magnetic interactions of the new flux with the pre-existing overlying coronal field. These phenomena are observed since early stages of the new flux emergence.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the progenitors of long-period hot subdwarf B (sdB) binaries, which form when low-mass red giant branch (RGB) stars lose their envelopes through stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOV) near the tip of the RGB. We aim to expand our previous volume-limited sample of 211 stars within 200 pc to 500 pc and validate it. Additionally, our goal is to provide the distribution of stellar parameters for these stars. We refined the original sample using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and interstellar extinction measurements. High-resolution spectra for 230 stars were obtained between 2019 and 2023 using the CORALIE spectrograph. To confirm or discard binarity, we combined astrometric parameters from Gaia with the resulting radial velocity variations. We derived the distribution of stellar parameters using atmospheric and evolutionary models, confirming that 82% of stars in our sample are indeed RGB stars using the equivalent evolutionary phase. The remaining 18% are red clump (RC) contaminants, which was expected due to the overlapping of RGB and RC stars in the colour-magnitude diagram. Additionally, 75% of the confirmed RGB stars have a high probability of being part of a binary system. Comparison with the literature shows good overall agreement with a scatter $\lesssim 15\%$ in stellar parameters, while the masses show somewhat higher dispersion ($\sim 20\%$).

 - **Abstract**
 Context. B hypergiants (BHGs) are important for understanding high-mass stellar evolution. While they are in a similar parameter space of B supergiants (BSGs), some BHGs are known to be luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their spectra with absorption and emission features resemble Of/WNh stars. Yet, their wind physics and their evolutionary connections are not clear. Aims. In this study, we aim to understand (i) the atmospheric and wind structure, (ii) the wind-launching and -driving mechanisms, and (iii) the spectrum formation of early-type BHGs. As an observational prototype, we use zet1 Sco (B1.5Ia+). Methods. Using the atmosphere code PoWRhd, we calculated the first hydrodynamically consistent models at the BHG domain. They give insights into the radiative driving of the calculated wind regimes and enable us to study the influence of clumping and X-rays on the resulting wind structure. Results. Our consistent model reproduces the main spectral features of zet1 Sco. The obtained mass-loss rate is higher than that of similar spectral type BSGs. However, the wind optical depth of BHGs is way below unity, making them less of a transition type. To reproduce zet1 Sco's spectrum, we needed low clumping with subsonic onset. The wind has a shallow-gradient velocity profile, deviating from the beta law, and is mainly driven by Fe III opacity. Conclusions. Our study suggests that despite more mass loss, early-type Galactic BHGs have winds relatively similar to BSGs. Their winds are not thick enough to characterize them as "transition-type" stars, unlike Of/WNh, implying that emission features arise more easily in cooler than in hotter stars. The spectral BHG appearance is likely connected to atmospheric inhomogeneities below the sonic point. To reach an appearance similar to LBVs, BHGs need to be either closer to the Eddington limit or have higher wind clumping than inferred for zeta1 Sco.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) line emission anisotropy across the Milky Way's disk to examine the effect of stellar feedback and Galactic dynamics on the distribution of the dense interstellar medium. The Hessian matrix method is used to characterize the CO line emission distribution and identify the preferential orientation across line-of-sight velocity channels in the Dame et al. 2001 composite Galactic plane survey, which covers the Galactic latitude range $|b|<5^{\circ}$. The structures sampled with this tracer are predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane toward the inner Galaxy, in clear contrast with the predominantly perpendicular orientation of the structures traced by neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) emission toward the same regions. The analysis of the Galactic plane portions sampled at higher angular resolution with other surveys reveals that the alignment with the Galactic plane is also prevalent at smaller scales. We find no preferential orientation in the CO emission toward the outer Galaxy, in contrast with the preferential alignment with the Galactic plane displayed by HI in that portion of the Milky Way. We interpret these results as the combined effect of the decrease in mid-plane pressure with increasing Galactocentric radius and SN feedback lifting diffuse gas more efficiently than dense gas off the Galactic plane.
