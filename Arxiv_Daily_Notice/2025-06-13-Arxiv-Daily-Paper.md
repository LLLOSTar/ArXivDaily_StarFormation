 - **Abstract**
 A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is observed as a three-dimensional data set known as a lightcone, consisting of a redshift (frequency) axis and two spatial sky plane axes. When observed by radio interferometers, this EoR signal is strongly obscured by foregrounds that are several orders of magnitude stronger. Due to its inherently non-Gaussian nature, the EoR signal requires robust statistical tools to accurately separate it from these foreground contaminants, but current foreground separation techniques focus primarily on recovering the EoR power spectrum, often neglecting valuable non-Gaussian information. Recent developments in astrophysics, particularly in the context of the Galactic interstellar medium, have demonstrated the efficacy of scattering transforms - novel summary statistics for highly non-Gaussian processes - for component separation tasks. Motivated by these advances, we extend the scattering transform formalism from two-dimensional data sets to three-dimensional EoR lightcones. To this end, we introduce a 3D wavelet set from the tensor product of 2D isotropic wavelets in the sky plane domain and 1D wavelets in the redshift domain. As generative models form the basis of component separation, our focus here is on building and validating generative models that can be used for component separation in future projects. To achieve this, we construct maximum entropy generative models to synthesise EoR lightcones, and statistically validate the generative model by quantitatively comparing the synthesised EoR lightcones with the single target lightcone used to construct them, using independent statistics such as the power spectrum and Minkowski Functionals. The synthesised lightcones agree well with the target lightcone both statistically and visually, opening up the possibility of developing for component separation methods using 3D scattering transforms.
#### Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multidepth datasets with selection effects: a case study for $3<z<5$ Ly$α$ emitters

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity function of any class of objects by jointly modeling data from multiple surveys with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g., in luminosity) and could be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass. We validate the model using mock catalogs, recovering how deep data reaching $\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity $\tilde{L}^\star$ are essential to reduce biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex), while wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As proof of concept, we consider a combined sample of 1176 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 < z < 5$ drawn from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow ($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide ($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) = 42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in agreement with studies based on gravitational lensing that reach $\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$], where statistical uncertainties still dominate.

 - **Abstract**
 Passing stars (also called stellar flybys) have notable effects on the solar system's long-term dynamical evolution, injection of Oort cloud comets into the solar system, properties of trans-Neptunian objects, and more. Based on a simplified solar system model, omitting the Moon and the Sun's quadrupole moment J2, it has recently been suggested that passing stars are also an important driver of paleoclimate before ~50 Myr ago, including a climate event called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56 Myr ago). In contrast, using a state-of-the-art solar system model, including a lunar contribution and J2, and random stellar parameters (>400 simulations), we find no influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 Myr. Even in an extreme flyby scenario in which the Sun-like star HD 7977 (m = 1.07 M_Sun) would have passed within ~3,900 au about 2.8 Myr ago (with 5% likelihood), we detect no discernible change in Earth's orbital evolution over the past 70 Myr, compared to our standard model. Our results indicate that a complete physics model is essential to accurately study the effects of stellar flybys on Earth's orbital evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of non-thermal proton energy transportation during solar and stellar flares is largely unknown; a better understanding of this physical process will allow us to rectify longstanding deficiencies in flare models. One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\alpha$ at 1215.67 Angstrom). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 Angstrom) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\textrm{flare} \approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.
#### On the Mass Budget Problem of Protoplanetary Disks: Streaming Instability and Optically Thick Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Statistical studies of protoplanetary disks and exoplanet populations often exhibit a "missing mass" problem, where observed dust masses in (sub-)millimeter surveys are significantly lower than expected when compared to the mass of evolved exoplanetary systems. We investigate how the streaming instability and subsequent planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks might solve this missing mass problem when (sub-)millimeter observations are interpreted under the assumption of optically thin emission. We conduct hydrodynamical simulations of the streaming instability with self-gravity after which radiative transfer calculations with dust scattering are performed to measure the (sub-)millimeter intensity. The measured intensity is then used to estimate the disk mass under the assumption of optically thin emission and compared to the true mass in the simulation to calculate the observational bias via the mass excess. We find that the emission from overdense filaments that emerge due to the streaming instability are optically thick at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, leading to mass excess factors of $\sim 2-7$, even when the optically thick fraction is low.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($<$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $>$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.
#### The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): II. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Ophiuchus Star-forming Region

 - **Abstract**
 The ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program aims to trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. This paper presents Band-6 ALMA observations of 10 embedded (Class I and Flat Spectrum) sources in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with spectral types ranging from M3 to K6 stars, which serve as the evolutionary starting point in the AGE-PRO sample. While we find 4 nearly edge on disks (>70 deg.), and 3 highly inclined disks (>60 deg.) in our sample, we show that, as a population, embedded disks in Ophiuchus are not significantly contaminated by more evolved, but highly inclined sources. We derived dust disk masses from the Band 6 continuum and estimated gas disk masses from the C18O and C17O lines. The mass estimates from the C17O line are slightly higher, suggesting C18O emission might be partially optically thick. While the 12CO and 13CO lines are severely contaminated by extended emission and self-absorption, the C18O and C17O lines allowed us to trace the radial extent of the gaseous disks. From these measurements, we found that the C18O and C17O fluxes correlate well with each other and with the continuum fluxes. Furthermore, the C18O and C17O lines present a larger radial extension than disk dust sizes by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, as it is found for Class II disks using the radial extension of the 12CO. In addition, we have detected outflows in three disks from 12CO observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6 stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6 setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of $\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between $10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.
#### The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): IV. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Upper Scorpius Star-forming Region

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program AGE-PRO explores protoplanetary disk evolution by studying gas and dust across various ages. This work focuses on ten evolved disks in Upper Scorpius, observed in dust continuum emission, CO and its isotopologues, and N$_2$H$^+$ with ALMA Bands 6 and 7. Disk radii, from the radial location enclosing 68% of the flux, are comparable to those in the younger Lupus region for both gas and dust tracers. However, solid masses are about an order of magnitude below those in Lupus and Ophiuchus, while the dust spectral index suggests some level of dust evolution. These empirical findings align with a combination of radial drift, dust trapping, and grain growth into larger bodies. A moderate correlation between CO and continuum fluxes suggests a link between gas and dust content, through the increased scatter compared to younger regions, possibly due to age variations, gas-to-dust ratio differences, or CO depletion. Additionally, the correlation between C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes observed in Lupus persists in Upper Sco, indicating a relatively stable CO gas abundance over the Class II stage of disk evolution. In conclusion, the AGE-PRO survey of Upper Scorpius disks reveals intriguing trends in disk evolution. The findings point towards potential gas evolution and the presence of dust traps in these older disks. Future high-resolution observations are needed to confirm these possibilities and further refine our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation in older environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.
#### The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VIII. The impact of external photoevaporation on disk masses and radii in Upper Scorpius

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disk evolution can be deeply influenced by the UV radiation emitted by neighboring massive stars (mainly of spectral type O and B). We show that the process of external photoevaporation, which causes an outside-in depletion of disk material due to environmental UV radiation, can lead to a significant decrease in disk size, and moderate in disk mass and lifetime even at moderate irradiation levels (1-10 G$_{0}$). In this work we investigate the role of external photoevaporation in shaping the masses and sizes of the ten AGE-PRO disks in the Upper Scorpius region, which we estimate to be subject to FUV fluxes ranging between 2 and 12 G$_{0}$, on average. We compare the disk masses and sizes resulting from 1D numerical viscous evolution simulations in which the effect of external photoevaporation is included, to the values retrieved from the AGE-PRO observations. While the pure viscous framework fails in adequately explaining the observed disk properties in Upper Scorpius, with the inclusion of external photoevaporation we can successfully reproduce gas disk sizes for 7 out of 10 sources within a factor <2, when the initial disk mass is 1-10% of the stellar mass. We emphasize the importance of accounting for the environmental irradiation when comparing star-forming regions of different ages, even when moderate FUV irradiation fields are experienced, as in the case of Upper Scorpius.

 - **Abstract**
 On 2024 December 28, CHIME/FRB detected the thus-far non-repeating FRB 20241228A with a real-time signal-to-noise ratio of $>50$. Approximately 112~s later, the X-ray Telescope onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was on source, the fastest follow-up to-date of a non-repeating FRB (Tohuvavohu et al. in prep.). Using CHIME/FRB and two of the three CHIME/FRB Outriggers, we obtained a Very Long Baseline Interferometry localization for FRB 20241228A with a 1$\sigma$ confidence ellipse of 11$^{\prime\prime}$ by 0.2$^{\prime\prime}$. This represents the first published localization using both the CHIME-KKO and CHIME-GBO Outriggers. We associate FRB 20241228A with a star-forming galaxy at a redshift of $z = 0.1614\pm0.0002$. The persistent X-ray luminosity limit at this source's location and distance is $<1.2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.3-10$ keV band, the most stringent limit of any non-repeating FRB to-date (Tohuvavohu et al. in prep.). The stellar mass ($\sim 2.6 \times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$) and star formation rate ($\sim 2.9\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) of the host galaxy of FRB 20241228A are consistent with the broader FRB host galaxy population. We measure significant scattering ($\sim$1ms) and scintillation ($\sim$20 kHz at 600 MHz) along the line of sight to this source, and suggest the scintillation screen is Galactic while the scattering screen is extragalactic. FRB 20241228A represents an exciting example of a new era in which we can harness VLBI-localizations and rapid high-energy follow-up to probe FRB progenitors.
