 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the flat- and isothermal-core configurations. We show analytically how our density profile satisfies these conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We demonstrate the versatility of our profile by putting it into the context of idealized N-body simulations and show that it provides excellent representations for both density and velocity dispersion structures of the simulation data. When an estimated fitting criterion is used to approximate the general cases, such as in cosmological simulations, the resulting regressions maintain their goodness of fit in both extremes, in the initial thermalization phase and the late core-collapse regime. Our density profile provides a framework for more detailed analyses of halos in different SIDM models while serving as the basis for reducing simulation needs and constructing initial conditions for deep core-collapse simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent literature on core-collapse supernovae suggests that a black hole (BH) can form within $\sim 1$ s of shock revival, while still culminating in a successful supernova. We refer to these as black hole supernovae, as they are distinct from other BH formation channels in both timescale and impact on the explosion. We simulate these events self-consistently from core-collapse until $20\text{-}50$ days after collapse using three axisymmetric models of a $60$ M$_\odot$ zero-age main sequence progenitor star and investigate how the composition of the ejecta is impacted by the BH formation. We employ Skyrme-type equations of state (EOSs) and vary the uncertain nucleonic effective mass, which affects the pressure inside the proto-neutron star through the thermal part of the EOS. This results in different BH formation times and explosion energies at BH formation, yielding final explosion energies between $0.06\text{-}0.72\times 10^{51}$ erg with $21.8\text{-}23.3$ M$_\odot$ of ejecta, of which $0\text{-}0.018$ M$_\odot$ is $^{56}$Ni. Compared to expectations from 1D simulations, we find a more nuanced EOS dependence of the explosion dynamics, the mass of the BH remnant, and the elemental composition of the ejecta. We investigate why the explosions survive despite the massive overburden and link the shape of the diagnostic energy curve and character of the ejecta evolution to the progenitor structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Clouds and hazes are abundant in the thin and cold atmospheres of Triton and Pluto, where they are thought to be produced by interactions between atmospheric gases and ultraviolet photons from the Sun and those scattered by the local interstellar medium. These interactions lead to a rich network of chemical reactions that produces higher order hydrocarbons and nitriles that condense out to form ice clouds, and ultimately complex haze particles that rain down onto the surface that impact the atmospheric thermal structure, gas chemistry, and surface evolution. In this chapter, we will review the observational evidence for clouds and hazes in the atmospheres of Triton and Pluto and theoretical interpretations thereof, and the emerging set of experiments aiming to produce Triton and Pluto clouds and hazes in the lab to learn about them in detail.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12233

 - **Abstract**
 Interferometric closure invariants, constructed from triangular loops of mixed Fourier components, capture calibration-independent information on source morphology. While a complete set of closure invariants is directly obtainable from measured visibilities, the inverse transformation from closure invariants to the source intensity distribution is not established. In this work, we demonstrate a deep learning approach, Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (DIReCT), to directly reconstruct the image from closure invariants. Trained on both well-defined mathematical shapes (two-dimensional gaussians, disks, ellipses, $m$-rings) and natural images (CIFAR-10), the results from our specially designed model are insensitive to station-based corruptions and thermal noise. The median fidelity score between the reconstruction and the blurred ground truth achieved is $\gtrsim 0.9$ even for untrained morphologies, where a unit score denotes perfect reconstruction. In our validation tests, DIReCT's results are comparable to other state-of-the-art deconvolution and regularised maximum-likelihood image reconstruction algorithms, with the advantage that DIReCT does not require hand-tuned hyperparameters for each individual prediction. This independent approach shows promising results and offers a calibration-independent constraint on source morphology, ultimately complementing and improving the reliability of sparse VLBI imaging results.
#### Kinetic tomography of the Galactic plane within 1.25 kiloparsecs from the Sun. The interstellar flows revealed by HI and CO line emission and 3D dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present a reconstruction of the line-of-sight motions of the local interstellar medium (ISM) based on the combination of a state-of-the-art model of the three-dimensional dust density distribution within 1.25 kpc from the Sun and the HI and CO line emission within Galactic latitudes $|b| < 5^{\circ}$. We use the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method to match the plane-of-the-sky 3D dust distribution across distances with the atomic and molecular line emission. We identify a significant correlation between the 3D dust model and the line emission. We employ this correlation to assign line-of-sight velocities to the dust across density channels and produce a face-on map of the local ISM radial motions with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). We find that most of the material in the 3D dust model follows the large-scale pattern of Galactic rotation; however, we also report local departures from the rotation pattern with standard deviations of 12.1 and 6.1 km/s for the HI and CO line emission, respectively. The mean kinetic energy densities of these streaming motions are around 0.68 and 0.18 eV/cm$^{3}$ from either gas tracer. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the velocity field, these values are within a factor of a few of the total kinetic energy density. These kinetic energy values are roughly comparable to other energy densities, thus confirming the near-equipartition introduced by the feedback loops connecting the physical processes in the local ISM. Yet, we find energy and momentum overdensities of around a factor of ten concentrated in the Radcliffe Wave, the Split, and other local density structures. Although we do not find evidence of the Local Spiral Arm impact in these overdensities, their distribution suggests the influence of other large-scale effects that, in addition to supernova feedback, shape the energy distribution in the Solar neighborhood.
#### Chemical Evolution during Molecular Cloud Formation Triggered by an Interstellar Shock Wave: Dependence on Shock Parameters and Comparison with Molecular Absorption Lines

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate chemistry in the compression layer behind the interstellar shock waves, where molecular cloud formation starts. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations of converging flows of atomic gas with shock parameters of inclination between the interstellar magnetic field and the shock wave, pre-shock density, and shock velocity. Then we derive 1D mean-flow models, along which we calculate a detailed gas-grain chemical reaction network as a post process with various chemical parameters, i.e. cosmic-ray ionization rate, abundances of PAHs, and metals in the gas phase. While carbon chains reach their peak abundances when atomic carbon is dominant in the pseudo-time-dependent models of molecular clouds, such behavior is less significant in our models since the visual extinction of the compression layer is low ($\lesssim 1$ mag) when atomic carbon is abundant. Carbon chains, CN, and HCN increase at $A_V \gtrsim 1$ mag, where the gas-phase C/O ratio increases due to water ice formation. Shock parameters affect the physical structure and the evolutional timescale of the compression layer, and thus molecular evolution. Carbon chains are more abundant in models with higher post-shock density and slower gas accumulation. We calculate molecular column densities in the compression layer and compare them with the observations of diffuse and translucent clouds, which show reasonable agreement for water ice, carbon chains, and HCO$^+$. The observed variation of their column densities could be due to the difference in shock parameters and chemical parameters. The column density of CN is overestimated, for which we discuss possible reasons.
#### Assessing Matched Filtering for Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational-Wave Detection

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae are a promising yet challenging target for detection due to the stochastic and complex nature of these signals. Conventional detection methods for core-collapse supernovae rely on excess energy searches because matched filtering has been hindered by the lack of well-defined waveform templates. However, numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae have improved our understanding of the gravitational wave signals they emit, which enables us, for the first time, to construct a set of templates that closely resemble predictions from numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae using a matched-filtering methods. We construct a theoretically-informed template bank and use it to recover a core-collapse supernova signal injected into real LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector data. We evaluate the detection efficiency of the matched-filtering approach and how well the injected signal is reconstructed. We discuss the false alarm rate of our approach and investigate the main source of false triggers. We recover 88\% of the signals injected at a distance of 1 kpc and 50% of the signals injected at 2 kpc. For more than 50% of the recovered events, the underlying signal characteristics are reconstructed within an error of 15%. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach and identify areas for further improvements to advance the potential of matched filtering for supernova gravitational-wave detection. We also present the open-source Python package SynthGrav used to generate the template bank.
#### Models of Mira variables of the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Consistent stellar evolution and nonlinear radial stellar pulsation calculations were carried out for models of asymptotic giant branch stars with initial masses $1.5M_\odot\le M_\mathrm{ZAMS}\le 3M_\odot$ and initial metal abundance $Z=0.006$. All the models are shown to be either the fundamental mode or the first overtone pulsators. The lower limit of the first overtone period increases with increasing mass of the Mira model from $\Pi_{1,\min}\approx 80$ days for $M=1.3M_\odot$ to $\Pi_{1,\min}\approx 120$ days for $M=2.6M_\odot$. The upper limit of the first overtone period and lower limit of the fundamental mode period depend on the stellar structure during mode switching and range from $\Pi_{1,\max}=130$, $\Pi_{0,\min}=190$ days for $M=0.96M_\odot$ to $\Pi_{1,\max}=210$, $\Pi_{0,\min}=430$ days for $M=2.2M_\odot$. The slope of the theoretical period--luminosity relation of Mira variables perceptibly increases with decreasing $Z$. Fourier spectra of the kinetic energy of twelve hydrodynamic models show a split of the fundamental mode maximum into several equidistant components. Frequency intervals between split components fall within the range $0.03 \le \Delta\nu/\nu_0 \le 0.1$. The superposition of radial oscillations with the fundamental mode splitting leads to the long-term amplitude variations with the cycle length from 10 to 30 times longer than the fundamental mode period. A more thorough analysis of hydrodynamic models is required for understanding the origin of the principal pulsation mode splitting.
#### Peculiar Dust Emission within the Orion Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, $\beta$. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at $ \lambda > 2$ mm implying non-constant indices on scales $\gtrsim$ 0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with NOEMA from 2.9 mm to 3.6 mm and ALMA-ACA in Band 4 (1.9 -- 2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6 -- 1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of $\sim 0.02 - 0.08$ pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with $\beta \approx -0.16 - 1.45$, which are notably lower than the $\beta$ values of $> 1.3$ measured for these sources on $0.08$ pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multi-scale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.
#### The pale blue dot: using the Planetary Spectrum Generator to simulate signals from hyper realistic exo-Earths

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres and surfaces of planets show tremendous amount of spatial variation, which has a direct effect on the spectrum of the object, even if this may not be spatially resolved. Here, we apply hyper realistic radiative simulations of Earth as an exoplanet comprising thousands of simulations and study the unresolved spectrum. The GlobES module on the Planetary Spectrum Generator was used, and we parameterized the atmosphere as described in the modern earth retrospective analysis for research and applications, MERRA2, database. The simulations were made into high spatial resolution images and compared to space based observations from the DSCOVR EPIC, at L1, and Himawari8, geostationary, satellites, confirming spatial variations and the spectral intensities of the simulations. The DSCOVR EPIC camera only functions in narrow wavelength bands, but strong agreement is demonstrated. It is shown that aerosols and small particles play an important role in defining Earths reflectance spectra, contributing significantly to its characteristic blue color. Subsequently, a comprehensive noise model is employed to constrain the exposure time required to detect O2, O3 and H2O as a function of varying ground and cloud cover for several concept observatories, including the habitable worlds observatory. Cloud coverage enhances the detectability of planets in reflected light, with important consequences for the design of the future HWO. The HWO concept would require between 3 to 10 times longer to observe the studied features than LUVOIR A but performs better than the HabEx without a starshade. The codes, routines, and the noise models are made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent works have challenged our canonical view of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars as tracers of exclusively old populations ($\gtrsim10$~Gyr) by proposing a fraction of these stars to be of intermediate ages ($\sim$2-5~Gyr). Since it is currently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars, our goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age clusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We used the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search for RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion and photometric distance we obtained a list of 302 RRL stars associated with Magellanic clusters. Of these, 23 RRL are likely members of 10 intermediate-age clusters: 3 and 7 in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, respectively. By modelling the inferred expectation values of the number of RRL stars per cluster, we inferred the delay time distribution of the RRL in three age ranges. For the old population ($>8$~Gyr) we find $2.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$. For the young (1-2 Gyr) and intermediate age (2-8 Gyr) populations we find rates of $0.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ and $0.27^{+0.1}_{-0.09}$ RRL$/10^5 M_\odot$, respectively. While radial velocities are necessary for definitively confirming cluster memberships, the high-probability list of intermediate-age RRL stars presented here offers a promising opportunity for the first direct confirmation of these enigmatic stars.
