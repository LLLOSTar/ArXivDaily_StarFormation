 - **Abstract**
 Low mass axion-like particles could be produced in abundance within the cores of hot, compact magnetic white dwarf (MWD) stars from electron bremsstrahlung and converted to detectable X-rays in the strong magnetic fields surrounding these systems. In this work, we constrain the existence of such axions from two dedicated Chandra X-ray observations of $\sim$40 ks each in the energy range $\sim$1 - 10 keV towards the magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) WD 1859+148 and PG 0945+246. We find no evidence for axions, which constrains the axion-electron times axion-photon coupling to $|g_{a\gamma \gamma} g_{aee}| \lesssim 1.54 \times 10^{-25}$ ($3.54 \times 10^{-25}$) GeV$^{-1}$ for PG 0945+246 (WD 1859+148) at 95% confidence for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV. We find an excess of low-energy X-rays between 1 - 3 keV for WD 1859+148 but determine that the spectral morphology is too soft to arise from axions; instead, the soft X-rays may arise from non-thermal emission in the MWD magnetosphere.
#### Are Models of Strong Gravitational Lensing by Clusters Converging or Diverging?

 - **Abstract**
 The increasingly large numbers of multiple images in cluster-scale gravitational lenses have allowed for tighter constraints on the mass distributions of these systems. Most lens models have progressed alongside this increase in image number. The general assumption is that these improvements would result in lens models converging to a common solution, suggesting that models are approaching the true mass distribution. To test whether or not this is occurring, we examine a sample of lens models of MACS J0416.1$-$2403 containing varying number of images as input. Splitting the sample into two bins (those including $<150$ and $>150$ images), we quantify the similarity of models in each bin using three comparison metrics, two of which are novel: Median Percent Difference, Frechet Distance, and Wasserstein Distance. In addition to quantifying similarity, the Frechet distance metric seems to also be an indicator of the mass sheet degeneracy. Each metric indicates that models with a greater number of input images are no more similar between one another than models with fewer input images. This suggests that lens models are neither converging nor diverging to a common solution for this system, regardless of method. With this result, we suggest that future models more carefully investigate lensing degeneracies and anomalous mass clumps (mass features significantly displaced from baryonic counterparts) to rigorously evaluate their model's validity. We also recommend further study into alternative, underutilized lens model priors (e.g. flux ratios) as an additional input constraint to image positions in hopes of breaking existing degeneracies.
#### Leveraging neutrino flavor physics for supernova model differentiation

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino flavor evolution is critical for understanding the physics of dense astrophysical regimes, including core-collapse supernovae (CCSN). Powerful numerical integration codes exist for simulating these environments, yet a complete understanding of the inherent nonlinearity of collective neutrino flavor oscillations and how it fits within the overall framework of these simulations remains an open challenge. For this reason, we continue developing statistical data assimilation (SDA) to infer solutions to the flavor field in a CCSN envelope, given simulated measurements far from the source. SDA is an inference paradigm designed to optimize a model with sparse data. Our model consists of neutrino beams emanating from a CCSN and coherently interacting with each other and with a background of other matter particles in one dimension $r$. One model feature of high interest is the distribution of those matter particles as a function of radius $r$, or the "matter potential" $V(r)$ -- as it significantly dictates flavor evolution. In this paper, we expand the model beyond previous incarnations, by replacing the monotonically-decaying analytic form for $V(r)$ we previously used with a more complex -- and more physically plausible -- set of profiles derived from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) hydrodynamics simulation of a CCSN explosion. We ask whether the SDA procedure can use simulated flavor measurements at physically accessible locations (i.e. in vacuum) to determine the extent to which different matter density profiles through which the neutrinos propagate in the matter-dominated regime are compatible with these measurements. Within the scope of our small-scale model, we find that the neutrino flavor measurements in the vacuum regime are able to discriminate between different matter profiles, and we discuss implications regarding a future galactic CCSN detection.
#### Exploring non-thermal emission from the star-forming region NGC 3603 through a realistic modelling of its environment

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Star-forming regions are gaining considerable interest in the high-energy astrophysics community as possible Galactic particle accelerators. In general, the role of electrons has not been fully considered in this kind of cosmic-ray source. However, the intense radiation fields inside these regions might make electrons significant gamma-ray contributors. Aims. We study the young and compact star-forming region NGC 3603, a well known gamma-ray emitter. Our intention is to test whether its gamma-ray emission can be produced by cosmic-ray electrons. Methods. We build a novel model by creating realistic 3D distributions of the gas and the radiation field in the region. We introduce these models into PICARD to perform cosmic-ray transport simulations and produce gamma-ray emission maps. The results are compared with a dedicated Fermi Large Area Telescope data analysis at high energies. We also explore the radio and neutrino emissions of the system. Results. We improve the existing upper limits of the NGC 3603 gamma-ray source extension. Although the gamma-ray spectrum is well reproduced with the injection of CR protons, it requires nearly 30\% acceleration efficiency. In addition, the resulting extension of the simulated hadronic source is in mild tension with the extension data upper limit. The radio data disfavours the lepton-only scenario. Finally, combining both populations, the results are consistent with all observables, although the exact contributions are ambiguous.

 - **Abstract**
 Spatially homogeneous thermal equilibria of self-gravitating gas, being impossible otherwise, are nevertheless allowed in an expanding background accounting for Universe's expansion. Furthermore, a fixed density at the boundary of a perturbation is a natural boundary condition keeping the mass finite inside without the need to invoke any unphysical this http URL facts allow us to develop a consistent gravitational thermodynamics of isothermal spheres inside an expanding Universe. In the canonical and grand canonical ensembles we identify an instability for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibria. We discuss a potential astrophysical application. If such an instability is triggered on baryonic gas at high redshift $z > 137$ when the primary baryonic component, namely atomic hydrogen, was still thermally locked to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, then the corresponding destabilized gaseous clouds have baryonic mass $\geq 0.8\cdot 10^5 {\rm M}_\odot$ and radius $\geq 15{\rm pc}$.

 - **Abstract**
 HeH$^+$ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH$^+$, ArH$^+$, and NeH$^+$) to investigate their formation in a harsh environment like the novae outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on the earlier published best-fitted physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova: QU Vulpeculae 1984 and CO type novae: RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH$^+$, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit of the surface brightness of HeH$^+$ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii with similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It is to be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining physical conditions in similar types of systems and validating our predictions based on new electron-impact rovibrational collisional data at temperatures up to 20,000 K.
#### Planetesimal gravitational collapse in a gaseous environment: Thermal and dynamic evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Planetesimal formation models often invoke the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds to overcome various barriers to grain growth and propose processes to concentrate particles sufficiently to trigger this collapse. On the other hand, the geochemical approach for planet formation constrains the conditions for planetesimal formation and evolution by providing temperatures that should be reached to explain the final composition of planetesimals, the building blocks of planets. To elucidate the thermal evolution during gravitational collapse, we used numerical simulations of a self-gravitating cloud of particles and gas coupled with gas drag. Our goal is to determine how the gravitational energy relaxed during the contraction is distributed among the different energy components of the system, and how this constrains a thermal and dynamical planetesimal's history. We identify the conditions necessary to achieve a temperature increase of several hundred kelvins, and as much as 1600 K. Our results emphasise the key role of the gas during the collapse.
#### The robustness of inferred envelope and core rotation rates of red-giant stars from asteroseismology

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation is an important, yet poorly-modelled phenomenon of stellar structure and evolution. Accurate estimates of internal rotation rates are therefore valuable for constraining stellar evolution models. We aim to assess the accuracy of asteroseismic estimates of internal rotation rates and how these depend on the fundamental stellar parameters. We apply the recently-developed method called extended-MOLA inversions to infer localised estimates of internal rotation rates of synthetic observations of red giants. We search for suitable reference stellar models following a grid-based approach, and assess the robustness of the resulting inferences to the choice of reference model. We find that matching the mixed mode pattern between the observation and the reference model is an important criterion to select suitable reference models. We propose to i) select a set of reference models based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter ii) compute rotation rates for all these models iii) use the mean value obtained across the whole set as the estimate of the internal rotation rates. We find that the effect of a near surface perturbation in the synthetic observations on the rotation rates estimated based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter is negligible. We conclude that when using an ensemble of reference models, constructed based on matching the mixed mode pattern, the input rotation rates can be recovered across a range of fundamental stellar parameters like mass, mixing-length parameter and composition. Further, red-giant rotation rates determined in this way are also independent of a near surface perturbation of stellar structure.
#### Evolution of Chemistry in the envelope of HOt CorinoS (ECHOS) II. The puzzling chemistry of isomers as revealed by the HNCS/HSCN ratio

 - **Abstract**
 The observational detection of some metastable isomers in the interstellar medium with abundances comparable to those of the most stable isomer, or even when the stable isomer is not detected, highlights the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry. This challenges our understanding of the interstellar chemistry. We present a chemical study of isomers through the sulphur isomer pair HNCS and HSCN, since HSCN has been observed in regions where its stable isomer has not been detected, and the observed HNCS/HSCN ratio seems to significantly vary from cold to warm regions. We have used the Nautilus chemical code to model the formation and destruction paths of HNCS and HSCN in different astrochemical scenarios, and the time evolution of the HNCS/HSCN ratio. We have also analysed the influence of the environmental conditions on their chemical abundances. We present an observational detection of the metastable isomer HSCN in the Class I object B1-a, but not of the stable isomer HNCS, despite HNCS lying 3200 K lower in energy than HSCN. Our results show an HNCS/HSCN ratio sensitive to the gas temperature and the evolutionary time, with the highest values obtained at early stages (t<10^4 yr) and low (Tg<20 K) temperatures. The results suggest a different efficiency of the isomerisation processes depending on the source temperature. The progressive decrease of HNCS/HSCN with gas temperature at early evolutionary times indicates that this ratio may be used as a tracer of cold young objects. This work also demonstrates the key role of grain surface chemistry in the formation of the isomer pair HNCS and HSCN in cold regions, and the importance of the ions H2NCS+ and HNCSH+ in warm/hot regions. Since most of the interstellar regions where HSCN is detected are cold regions, a larger sample including sources characterised by high temperatures are needed to corroborate the theoretical results.
#### Emission Line Velocity, Metallicity and Extinction Maps of the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Optical emission lines across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have been measured from multiple fields using the Australian National University (ANU) 2.3m telescope with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS). Interpolated maps of the gas-phase metallicity, extinction, H$\alpha$ radial velocity and H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion have been made from these measurements. There is a metallicity gradient from the centre to the north of the galaxy of ~-0.095 dex/kpc with a shallower metallicity gradient from the centre to the south of the galaxy of ~-0.013 dex/kpc. There is an extinction gradient of ~-0.086 E(B-V)/kpc from the centre going north and shallower going from the centre to the south of ~-0.0089 E(B-V)/kpc. The SMC eastern arm has lower extinction than the main body. The radial velocity of the gas from the H$\alpha$ line and the HI line have been compared across the SMC. In general there is good agreement between the two measurements, though there are a few notable exceptions. Both show a region that has different radial velocity to the bulk motion of the SMC in the southern western corner by at least 16 kms$^{-1}$. The velocity dispersion from H$\alpha$ and HI across the SMC have also been compared, with the H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion usually the higher of the two. The eastern arm of the SMC generally has lower velocity dispersion than the SMC's main body. These measurements enable a detailed examination of the SMC, highlighting its nature as a disrupted satellite galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Identified as parsec-size, gas clumps at the junction of multiple filaments, hub-filament systems (HFS) play a crucial role during the formation of young clusters and high-mass stars. These HFS appear nevertheless to be detached from most galactic filaments when compared in the mass-length (M-L) phase-space. We aim to characterize the early evolution of HFS as part of the filamentary description of the interstellar medium. Combining previous scaling relations with new analytic calculations, we created a toy model to explore the different physical regimes described by the M-L diagram. Despite its simplicity, our model accurately reproduces several observational properties reported for filaments and HFS such as their expected typical aspect ratio ($A$), mean surface density ($\Sigma$), and gas accretion rate ($\dot{m}$). Moreover, this model naturally explains the different mass and length regimes populated by filaments and HFS, respectively. Our model predicts a dichotomy between filamentary ($A\geq 3$) and spheroidal ($A<3$) structures connected to the relative importance of their fragmentation, accretion, and collapse timescales. Individual filaments with low accretion rates are dominated by an efficient internal fragmentation. In contrast, the formation of compact HFS at the intersection of filaments triggers a geometric phase-transition leading to the gravitational collapse of these structures at parsec-scales in $\sim$1Myr also inducing higher accretion rates.

 - **Abstract**
 The innermost region of the Milky Way harbors the central molecular zone (CMZ). This region contains a large amount of molecular gas but a poor star formation rate considering the densities achieved by the gas in this region. We used the arepo code to perform a hydrodynamic and star formation simulation of the Galaxy, where a Ferrers bar was adiabatically introduced. During the stage of bar imposition, the bar strength excites density waves close to the inner Lindblad resonance guiding material toward the inner Galaxy, driving the formation of a ring that we qualitatively associate with the CMZ. During the simulation, we identified that the ring passes three main phases, namely: formation, instability, and quasi-stationary stages. During the whole evolution, and particularly in the quasi-stationary stage, we observe that the ring is associated with the x2 family of periodic orbits. Additionally, we found that most of the star formation occurs during the ring formation stage, while it drastically decreases in the instability stage. Finally, we found that when the gas has settled in a stable x2 orbit, the star formation takes place mostly after the dense gas passes the apocenter, triggering the conveyor-belt mechanism described in previous studies.
#### First Identification and Chemical Modeling of New Thiol ($-$SH) Bearing Molecule in the Interstellar Medium: Dithioformic Acid

 - **Abstract**
 The study of complex organic molecules containing thiol ($-$SH) groups is essential in interstellar media because $-$SH plays an important role in the polymerization of amino acids (R-CH(NH$_{2}$)-COOH). Some quantum chemical studies have shown that there is a high chance of detecting the emission lines of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) in the highly dense and warm-inner regions of hot molecular cores and hot corinos. Therefore, we attempted to search for the emission lines of HC(S)SH toward the highly dense hot corino object NGC 1333 IRAS 4A using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 7. We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the trans-conformer of dithioformic acid (t-HC(S)SH) toward the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2. The column density and excitation temperature of the t-HC(S)SH toward NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 are (2.63$\pm$0.32)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 255$\pm$32 K, respectively. The fractional abundance of t-HC(S)SH with respect to H$_{2}$ is (2.53$\pm$0.68)$\times$10$^{-9}$. The column density ratio of t-HC(S)SH and t-HCOOH toward NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 is 0.36$\pm$0.02. To understand the possible formation pathways of HC(S)SH, we computed a two-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of HC(S)SH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. After chemical modeling, we claim that HC(S)SH is formed in NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 via barrierless radical--radical reactions between CSSH and H on the grain surfaces.
