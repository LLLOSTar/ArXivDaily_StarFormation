 - **Abstract**
 Despite the fundamental importance of the star formation history (SFH) and the initial mass function (IMF) in the description of the Milky Way, their consistent and robust derivation is still elusive. Recent and accurate astrometry and photometry collected by the Gaia satellite provide the natural framework to consolidate these ingredients in our local Galactic environment. We aim to simultaneously infer the IMF and the SFH of the Galactic disc comparing Gaia data with the mock catalog resulting from the Besançon population synthesis model (BGM). Our goal is also to estimate the impact of the systematics present in current stellar evolutionary models on this inference. We use a new implementation of the BGM Fast Approximate Simulations (BGM FASt) framework to fit the seven million star Gaia DR3 all-sky $G<13$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to the most updated dynamically self-consistent BGM. Our derived SFH supports an abrupt decrease of the star formation approximately 1-1.5 Gyr ago followed by a significant enhancement with a wide plateau in the range 2-6 Gyr ago. A remarkable hiatus appears around 5-7 Gyr ago with a $\sim$1 Gyr shift depending on the set of stellar models. A complex and discrepant evolution at ages older than 8 Gyr deserves further investigation. Precise but discrepant values are found for the power-law indices of the IMF. For the range 0.5-1.53 $M_\odot$ the slope takes a value of $\alpha_2 = 1.45^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$, while for masses larger than 1.53 $M_\odot$ we obtain $\alpha_3 = 1.98^{+0.13}_{-0.05}$. The current implementation of the BGM FASt framework is ready to address executions fitting all-sky Gaia data up to 14-17 apparent limiting magnitude. This will naturally allow us to derive both a reliable SFH for the early epochs of the Galactic disc evolution and a precise slope for the IMF at low masses.

 - **Abstract**
 The proliferation of exoplanet discoveries in exotic environments like the Neptune desert challenges our understanding of planetary atmospheres under intense irradiation. The unexpected discovery of LTT9779 b, an ultra-hot Neptune within this desert, offers a prime opportunity for atmospheric studies. We build on prior observations of LTT9779 b from TESS, Spitzer, and CHEOPS, incorporating new VLT/ESPRESSO data to probe its atmospheric dynamics. Preliminary analyses suggest a metal-rich atmosphere and a high day-side geometric albedo, possibly indicating silicate clouds. Minimal atmospheric escape is observed, contrasting existing models of planetary evolution under extreme irradiation. We obtained the transmission spectrum of LTT9779 b between 0.4 and 0.78 microns with ESPRESSO, addressing systematics across three transits. Our analysis focused on the sodium doublet and H-alpha, using cross-correlation with models containing Na, K, FeH, TiO, and VO. No significant atmospheric signal was detected, with metallicity limits set at [Fe/H] >= 2.25 (>= 180 times solar). The non-detection aligns with a high-metallicity, cloud-free model, implying a high mean molecular weight and reduced atmospheric scale height. We interpret this as evidence for a metal-rich atmosphere with suppressed spectral features, possibly due to high-altitude clouds or hazes. These findings are consistent with JWST observations, supporting the hypothesis of metal-rich atmospheres obscured by aerosols in extreme environments.
#### Observing Rayleigh-Taylor stable and unstable accretion through a Kalman filter analysis of X-ray pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Global, three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of rotating, magnetized, compact stellar objects reveal that accretion occurs in three regimes: the stable regime, the chaotic unstable regime, and the ordered unstable regime. Here we track stochastic fluctuations in the pulse period $P(t)$ and aperiodic X-ray luminosity $L(t)$ time series of 24 accretion-powered pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud using an unscented Kalman filter to analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data. We measure time-resolved histories of the magnetocentrifugal fastness parameter $\omega(t)$ and we connect $\omega(t)$ with the three Rayleigh-Taylor accretion regimes. The 24 objects separate into two distinct groups, with 10 accreting in the stable regime, and 14 accreting in the ordered unstable regime. None of the 24 objects except SXP 293 visit the chaotic unstable regime for sustained intervals, although several objects visit it sporadically. The Kalman filter output also reveals a positive temporal cross-correlation between $\omega(t)$ and the independently measured pulse amplitude $A(t)$, which agrees with simulation predictions regarding the pulse-forming behavior of magnetospheric funnel flows in the three accretion regimes.
#### Velocity Structure of Circumstellar Environment around Class 0/I Protostars: Uncertainty in the Protostellar Mass Estimation Using Circumstellar Velocities

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of the circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies have reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller than the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the observed rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical origins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to $10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall velocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of $\sim \! 100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity. The degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field strength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis, and (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the ratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as $0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the reliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational velocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true value, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the infall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be overestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore the critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and highlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.
#### Core mass function in view of fractal and turbulent filaments and fibers

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the core mass function (CMF) can be driven by filament fragmentation. To model a star-forming system of filaments and fibers, we develop a fractal and turbulent tree with a fractal dimension of 2 and a Larson's law exponent ($\beta$) of 0.5. The fragmentation driven by convergent flows along the splines of the fractal tree yields a Kroupa-IMF-like CMF that can be divided into three power-law segments with exponents $\alpha$ = $-0.5$, $-1.5$, and $-2$, respectively. The turnover masses of the derived CMF are approximately four times those of the Kroupa IMF, corresponding to a star formation efficiency of 0.25. Adopting $\beta=1/3$, which leads to fractional Brownian motion along the filament, may explain a steeper CMF at the high-mass end, with $\alpha=-3.33$ close to that of the Salpeter IMF. We suggest that the fibers of the tree are basic building blocks of star formation, with similar properties across different clouds, establishing a common density threshold for star formation and leading to a universal CMF.
#### Hydroxylamine in Astrophysical Ices: IR Spectra and Cosmic Ray-Induced Radiolytic Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-phase hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH) has recently been detected within dense clouds in the interstellar medium. However, it is also likely present within interstellar ices, as well as on the icy surfaces of outer Solar System bodies, where it may react to form more complex prebiotic molecules such as amino acids. In this work, we aimed to provide IR spectra of NH$_2$OH in astrophysical ice analogues that will help in the search for this molecule in various astrophysical environments. Furthermore, we aimed to provide quantitative information on the stability of NH$_2$OH upon exposure to ionizing radiation analogous to cosmic rays, as well as on the ensuing chemistry and potential formation of complex prebiotic molecules. Ices composed of NH$_2$OH, H$_2$O, and CO were prepared by vapor deposition and IR spectra were acquired between $4000-500$~cm$^{-1}$ ($2.5-20 \mu$m) prior and during irradiation using 15 keV protons. In interstellar ice analogues, the most prominent IR absorption band of NH$_2$OH is that at about 1188~cm$^{-1}$, which may be a good candidate to use in searches of this species in icy space environments. Calculated effective destruction cross-sections and G-values for the NH$_2$OH-rich ices studied show that NH$_2$OH is rapidly destroyed upon exposure to ionizing radiation (more rapidly than a number of previously studied organic molecules), and that this destruction is slightly enhanced when it is mixed with other icy species. The irradiation of a NH$_2$OH:H$_2$O:CO ternary ice mixture leads to a rich chemistry that includes the formation of simple inorganic molecules such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and H$_2$O$_2$, as well as ammonium salts and, possibly, complex organic molecules relevant to life such as formamide, formic acid, urea, and glycine.
#### Rotational Excitation of Vinyl Cyanide by Collisions with Helium Atoms at Low Temperature

 - **Abstract**
 Among the numerous molecular systems found in the interstellar medium (ISM), vinyl cyanide is the first identified olephinic nitrile. While it has been observed in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the 2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are not fulfilled, and an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves solving the statistical equilibrium equations taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes. This in turn requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first three-dimensional CH$_2$CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combination of two basis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_2$CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical close-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to-state cross sections derived from these calculations are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients. The interaction potential exhibits a high anisotropy, with a global minimum of $-53.5$ cm$^{-1}$ and multiple local minima. Collisional cross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the cross-sections, collisional rate coefficients are determined for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favouring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.
#### The role of cloud particle properties on WASP-39b transmission spectrum based on JWST/NIRSpec observations

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols are capable of having a huge influence on reflected, emitted and transmitted planetary spectra. The Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) using the PRISM mode on board of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is providing valuable data of transit spectra over a wide spectral range that is able to cover the whole contribution of aerosols, potentially disentangling them from other constituents and thus allowing to constrain their properties. We aim to investigate whether NIRSpec/PRISM JWST transmission spectroscopy observations, in addition to being useful to detect and determine the abundance of gases more accurately than any previous instruments, are also capable of studying the physical properties of the aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. We perform nested sampling Bayesian retrievals with MultiNest library. We use the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and the Modelled Optical Properties of enSeMbles of Aerosol Particles (MOPSMAP) database as tools for the forward simulations and NIRSpec/PRISM JWST previously published observations of WASP-39b as input data. Retrievals indicate that models including an aerosol extinction weakly increasing or sharply decreasing with wavelength are decisively better than those with a flat transmission and that this increased degree of complexity is supported by the kind of data that JWST/NIRSpec can provide. Given other physical constraints from previous works, the scenario of weakly increasing particle extinction is favoured. We also find that this also has an effect on the retrieved gas abundances. JWST observations have the potential to study some physical characteristics of exoplanetary clouds, in particular their overall dependence of transmissivity with wavelength. In fact, it is important to implement more detailed aerosol models as their extinction may affect significantly retrieved molecular abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary objectives of the SPHEREx mission is to understand the origin of molecules such as H2O, CO2, and other volatile compounds at the early stages of planetary system formation. Because the vast majority of these compounds -- typically exceeding 95% -- exist in the solid phase rather than the gaseous phase in the systems of concern here, the observing strategy planned to characterize them is slightly unusual. Specifically, SPHEREx will target highly obscured sources throughout the Milky Way, and observe the species of concern in absorption against background illumination. SPHEREx spectrophotometry will yield ice column density measurements for millions of obscured Milky Way sources of all ages and types. By correlating those column densities with source ages, the SPHEREx mission will shed light on whether those molecules were formed in situ along with their nascent stellar systems, or whether instead they formed elsewhereand were introduced into those systems after their formation. To that end, this work describes version 7.1 of the SPHEREx Target List of Ice Sources (SPLICES) for the community. It contains about 8.6 million objects brighter than W2~12 Vega mag over much of the sky, principally within a broad strip running the length of the Milky Way midplane, but also within high-latitude molecular clouds and even the Magellanic Clouds.
