 - **Abstract**
 There has been growing evidence that the rich star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds contain significant fractions of rapidly rotating stars. In this work, we aim to constrain these fractions by studying the colour-magnitude diagrams of four star clusters, selected among those with the most striking signatures of fast rotators. Using isochrones derived from PARSEC v2.0 stellar tracks, we generate distinct stellar populations, each covering a limited interval of initial rotation rates $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, referred to as 'Partial Models' (PMs). Using optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo Markov Chains, PMs are combined to create the final best-fitting model. In our analysis, we adopt two key assumptions: a uniform age and an isotropic distribution of stellar spin axes within each cluster. The solutions are allowed to explore the entire range of $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, and different values of age, metallicity, distance and foreground extinction. We find that the rotational velocity distributions in all four clusters reveal a high fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}$ close to the break-up value, in all cases. Specifically, the fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}>0.7$ exceeds $80\%$ in the clusters NGC 419 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and NGC 1831 and NGC 1866 of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For NGC 2203 of the LMC, this fraction is smaller, although it still exceeds $50\%$, confirming that also this cluster is mainly populated by fast-rotating stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Future telescopes will characterize rocky exoplanets in reflected light, revealing their albedo, which depends on surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties. Identifying these features is crucial for assessing habitability. We present reference spectra and phase curves for an unresolved Earth-like exoplanet in reflected and polarized light, showing how phase- and wavelength-dependent reflectance reveals key planetary properties. Using the 3D radiative transfer code MYSTIC, we enhance surface and cloud modeling with validated, wavelength-dependent albedo maps of Earth's seasonal and spectral features, alongside a novel treatment of sub-grid cloud variability using ERA5 reanalysis data. Our models, incorporating high-resolution 3D cloud structures, show that sub-grid cloud variability reduces total reflectance and increases phase curve variability, especially at large phase angles where ocean glint dominates. We also find that neglecting wavelength-dependent albedo maps overestimates the vegetation red edge in spectra. Comparing an Ocean planet to an Earth-like planet with seasonal cloud variability, we show that polarization is more sensitive than intensity alone in distinguishing both cases. Moreover, polarization captures richer surface details, making it a crucial tool for resolving retrieval degeneracies. Our simulations serve as a reference for observing Earth as an exoplanet and provide benchmarks for optimizing observational strategies and retrieval frameworks for future telescopes targeting small, rocky exoplanets.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains poorly constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales <~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

 - **Abstract**
 Here, we present several examples of unusual evolutionary patterns in solar coronal loops that resemble cross-field drift motions. These loops were simultaneously observed from two vantage points by two different spacecraft: the High-Resolution Imager (HRI$_{EUV}$) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager aboard the Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Across all these events, a recurring pattern is observed: Initially, a thin, strand-like structure detaches and shifts several megameters (Mm) away from a main or parent loop. During this period, the parent loop remains intact in its original position. After a few minutes, the shifted strand reverses its direction and returns to the location of the parent loop. Key features of this `split-drift' type evolution are: (i) the presence of kink oscillations in the loops before and after the split events, (ii) a sudden split motion at about 30~km.s$^{-1}$, with additional slow drifts, either away from or back to the parent loops, at around 5~km.s$^{-1}$. Co-temporal photospheric magnetic field data obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) reveal that during such split-drift evolution, one of the loop points in the photosphere moves back and forth between nearby magnetic polarities. While the exact cause of this `split-drift' phenomenon is still unclear, the consistent patterns observed in its characteristics indicate that there may be a broader physical mechanism at play. This underscores the need for further investigation through both observational studies and numerical simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 The statistical characteristics of double main-sequence (MS) binaries are essential for investigating star formation, binary evolution, and population synthesis. Our previous study proposed a machine learning-based method to identify MS binaries from MS single stars using mock data from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). We further utilized detection efficiencies and an empirical mass ratio distribution to estimate the binary fraction within the sample. To further validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted a more realistic sample simulation, incorporating additional factors such as metallicity, extinction, and photometric errors from CSST simulations. The detection efficiency for binaries with mass ratios between 0.2 and 0.7 reached over 80%. We performed a detailed observational validation using the data selected from the Gaia Sky Survey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer. The detection efficiency for MS binaries in the observed sample was 65%. The binary fraction can be inferred with high precision for a set of observed samples, based on accurate empirical mass ratio distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), through gravothermal evolution driven by elastic self-scatterings, offers a compelling explanation for the observed diversity of inner halo densities. In this work, we investigate SIDM dynamics in a two-component dark matter model with mass ratios of order unity, motivated by an asymmetric dark matter framework that naturally evades constraints from relic abundance and mediator decay, while enabling strong, velocity-dependent self-interactions. We show that cross-component scatterings significantly enhance mass segregation, driving the formation of dense, core collapsed-like halos. This effect couples naturally to SIDM-induced diversity, introducing a new mechanism for generating structural variations beyond those arising from gravothermal evolution alone. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for reconciling SIDM with small-scale observational tensions by enabling shifts in central densities while preserving the flexibility to generate diverse halo structures. We further highlight that halo structural diversity may serve as a diagnostic of dark sector composition, opening a new observational window into the particle nature of SIDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength $\sim$4.647$\mu$m and FWHM 0.0265$\mu$m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)$_{\rm aliph}\approx 0.17\pm0.02$ -- a factor $\sim$$10^4$ enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On $\sim$$50\,$pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H$\,$II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\,$II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\rm arom} \lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the $4.65\mu$m feature may be detectable in absorption.
#### Fluorine production in He-burning regions of massive stars during cosmic history

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of fluorine is still a debated question. AGB stars synthesise this element and likely contribute significantly to its synthesis in the present-day Universe. However, it is not clear whether other sources contribute, especially in the early Universe. We discuss variations of the surface abundances of fluorine coming from our massive star models and compare them with available present-day observations. We compute the contribution of massive stars in producing 19F over metallicities covering the whole cosmic history. We used models in the mass range of 9Msol < Mini < 300Msol at metallicities from Pop III up to super-solar while accounting for the required nuclear network to follow the evolution of 19F during the core H- and He-burning phases. Results from models with and without rotational mixing are presented. We find that rotating models predict a slight depletion of fluorine at their surface at the end of the MS phase. In more advanced evolutionary phases, only models with an initial mass larger than 25Msol at metallicities Z > 0.014 show phases where the abundance of fluorine is enhanced. This occurs when the star is a WR star of the WC type. WC stars can show surface abundances of fluorine ten times larger than their initial abundance. However, we obtained that the winds of massive stars at metallicities larger than Z=0.006 do not significantly contribute to fluorine production, confirming previous findings. In contrast, very metal-poor rapidly rotating massive star models may be important sources of fluorine through the mass expelled at the time of their SN explosion. Observations of WC stars at solar or super-solar metallicities may provide very interesting indications on the nuclear pathways that lead to fluorine production in massive stars. The possibility of observing fluorine-rich CEMPs is also a way to put constrains in present models at very low metallicities.
#### Unveiling the reflection spectrum in the ultracompact LMXB 4U 1820-30

 - **Abstract**
 4U 1820-30 is a ultracompact X-ray binary located in the globular cluster NGC 6624, consisting of a neutron star accreting material from a helium white dwarf companion characterized by the shortest known orbital period for this type of star (11.4 minutes). Despite extensive studies, the detection of the relativistic Fe K emission line, has been inconsistently reported and no measurement of the system inclination has been achieved. In this work, we investigate the broadband spectral and polarimetric properties of 4U 1820-30, exploring the presence of a reflection component and its role in shaping the polarization signal. We analyzed simultaneous X-ray observations from NICER, NuSTAR, and IXPE. The spectral continuum was modeled with a disk blackbody, a power law, and a Comptonization component with seed photons originating from a boundary layer. We detected a strong reflection component, described, for the first time, with two self-consistent models ({\tt Relxillns} and {\tt Rfxconv}), allowing us to provide a measurement of the system inclination angle (about 31 degrees), supporting the low-inclination hypothesis. Subsolar iron abundances were detected in the accretion disk and interstellar medium, probably related to the source location in a metal-poor globular cluster. The polarization increases from an upper limit of $1.2\%$ in the 2--4 keV band up to about $8\%$ in the 7--8 keV range. The disk is expected to be orthogonally polarized to these components, which may help to explain the decreasing of the observed polarization at low energies. However, the high polarization degree we found challenges the current models, also taking into consideration the relatively low inclination angle derived from the spectral analysis.
#### From moving groups to star formation in the Solar Neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 Moving groups in the solar neighborhood are ensembles of co-moving stars, likely originating due to forces from spiral arms, the Galactic bar, or external perturbations. Their co-movement with young clusters indicates recent star formation within these moving groups, but a lack of precise three-dimensional position and velocity measurements has obscured this connection. Using backward orbit integrations of 509 clusters within 1 kpc - based on Gaia DR3 and supplemented with APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 radial velocities - we trace their evolution over the past 100 Myr. We find that most clusters separate into three spatial groups that each trace one of the Pleiades, Coma Berenices, and Sirius moving groups. The same trend is not seen for the Hyades moving group. The young clusters of the Alpha Persei, Messier 6, and Collinder 135 families of clusters, previously found to have formed in three massive star-forming complexes, co-move with either the Pleiades (Alpha Persei and Messier 6) or Coma Berenices (Collinder 135). Our results provide a sharper view of how large-scale Galactic dynamics have shaped recent, nearby star formation.
