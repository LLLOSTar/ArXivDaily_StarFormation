 - **Abstract**
 We present a new radio detection from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey associated with the reflection nebula (RN) VdB-80. The radio detection is determined to be a previously unidentified HII region, now named Lagotis. The RN is located towards Monoceros, centred in the molecular cloud feature known as the `Crossbones'. The 944 MHz EMU image shows a roughly semicircular HII region with an integrated flux density of 30.2$\pm$0.3 mJy. The HII region is also seen at 1.4 GHz by NVSS, yielding an estimated spectral index of 0.65$\pm$0.51, consistent with thermal radio emission. Gaia DR3 and 2MASS data give a distance to the stars associated with the HII region of $\sim$960 pc. This implies a size of 0.76$\times$0.68($\pm$0.09) pc for the HII region. We derive an HII region electron density of the bright radio feature to be 26 cm$^{-3}$, requiring a Lyman-alpha photon flux of $10^{45.6}$ s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the expected Lyman flux of HD 46060, the B2II type star which is the likely ionising star of the region. The derived distance to this region implies that the Crossbones feature is a superposition of two filamentary clouds, with Lagotis embedded in the far cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 In galaxy mergers, dual quasars - two actively accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) - provide a unique opportunity to study the interplay between galaxy dynamics and quasar activity. However, very little is known about their molecular gas, which fuels star formation and quasar activity. In this study, we map the kinematics of the cold molecular gas in J0749+2255, a 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar at z=2.17 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 4. We detect CO(4-3)650um, which shows remarkably complex morphological and kinematic structures. While the integrated CO map suggested a lens-like ring, this feature disappears with kinematic decomposition. The kinematic analysis with ALMA resolves the ambiguities introduced by previous observations, further supporting the dual quasar interpretation of J0749+2255. We find two kinematically distinct molecular gas components: spatially extended, yet dynamically complex slow-moving gas (FWHM~130 km/s), and a compact, blueshifted, fast-moving, turbulent gas (FWHM~300 km/s). The disturbed kinematics, likely driven by the merger, show hints of rotation but no molecular outflows, suggesting circumnuclear flows. We estimate a large molecular gas reservoir ($M_{H2}\sim10^{10} M_{\odot}$), yet the starburst activity appears to exceed the available fuel. We detect an extended continuum in excess at rest-frame 455 GHz. The kinematic complexity of CO implicates the connection of mergers on the starburst and quasar activity in J0749+2255, yet whether J0749+2255 represents the dual quasar population remains unclear. Targeted kinematic studies of larger dual quasar samples will be essential to disentangling the nature of dual quasars.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated the possibility of using two recently characterised triply eclipsing triple systems to constrain stellar model parameters. We specifically focused on evaluating the influence of the underlying astrophysical assumptions employed in the characterisation of the system to fix absolute values of the radii, effective temperatures, and metallicity. We used dense grids of pre-computed stellar models to fit the data for the triply eclipsing systems with a modified version of the SCEPtER pipeline. We achieve an excellent agreement with observational data for TIC 650024463, which comprises three low-mass main-sequence (MS) stars. We find it has an age of $9.0^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ Gyr and a multimodal posterior density. Characterising TIC 323486857 proved more challenging. This system comprises two intermediate-mass MS stars and a slightly more massive tertiary in the red giant branch phase. For this last system we tested alternative scenarios for convective core overshooting. When all stars were assumed to have the same overshooting efficiency, significant discrepancies arose with the observed data for the tertiary star. This discrepancy may arise from the different assumptions regarding overshooting efficiency made for the observational characterisation of the system, in which an increasing overshooting efficiency with stellar mass was adopted. By allowing independent overshooting efficiencies for all stars, we recovered a solution close to that adopted in the system observational characterisation. Encouragingly, despite the relevant differences between the adopted stellar models and those used for the observational characterisation, we found a system age of $2.33^{+0.18}_{-0.16}$ Gyr in all the tested scenarios, and this age is in agreement with independent determinations.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs (WDs) showing transits from orbiting planetary debris provide significant insights into the structure and dynamics of debris disks. This is a rare class of objects with only eight published systems. In this work, we perform a systematic search for such systems within 500 pc in the Gaia-eDR3 catalog of WDs using the light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and present six new candidates. Our selection process targets the top 1% most photometrically variable sources identified using a combined variability metric from ZTF and Gaia eDR3 photometry, boosted by a metric space we define using von Neumann statistics and Pearson-Skew as a novel discovery tool to identify these systems. This is followed by optical spectroscopic observations of visually selected variables to confirm metal pollution. Four of the six systems show long-timescale photometric variability spanning several months to years, resulting either from long-term evolution of transit activity or dust and debris clouds at wide orbits. Among them, WD J1013-0427 shows an indication of reddening during the long-duration dip. Interpreting this as dust extinction makes it the first system to indicate an abundance of small dust grains (radius $\lesssim$$0.3~{\rm \mu m}$) in the occulting material. The same object also shows metal emission lines that map an optically thick eccentric gas disk orbiting within the star's Roche limit. For each candidate, we infer the abundances of the photospheric metals and estimate accretion rates. We show that transiting debris systems tend to have higher inferred accretion rates compared to the general population of metal-polluted WDs. Growing the number of these systems will further illuminate such comparative properties in the near future. Separately, we also serendipitously discovered an AM CVn showing a very long-duration outburst $-$ only the fourth such system to be known.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the optical spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20240114A. The host galaxy is a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of $z=0.1306\pm0.0002$. With a rest-frame coverage of 4300-7900 Å, we have detected H$\rm{\alpha}$, H$\rm{\beta}$, [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007, [N II]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583, and [S II]$\lambda$6716 emission lines. The emission line ratios suggest that the ionization in the host galaxy is dominated by star formation. The star formation rate (SFR) derived from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ emission line is $(0.06 \pm 0.01) \ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$, and the SED fitting suggests the lower limit of the SFR(UV) is $0.09 \ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. The stellar mass is $(\rm 4.0 \pm 1.8) \times 10^8 \ M_{\odot}$, making the specific star formation rate $\rm log \ sSFR(H\rm \alpha) = -9.17 \pm 0.07 \ yr^{-1}$. The line ratios indicate an upper limit of a metallicity of $\rm 12+log_{10} ([O/H]) \sim 8.5$. As the nearest dwarf host galaxy with a repeating FRB, the activity of FRB 20240114A and the properties of this host galaxy closely resemble those of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B. The H$\rm{\alpha}$-traced dispersion measure (DM) provided by the ionized gas of the host galaxy has a moderate contribution of $\sim 200 \rm \ pc \ cm^{-3}$, assuming a warm ionized gas. We found that the distributions of the stellar mass versus SFR are significantly different between repeating and one-off FRBs, as determined by the MANOVA test with $p=0.0116$.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, millisecond-duration transients that offer great potential for probing the universe, yet their physical origins remain unclear. The dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\tau$) distributions provide key insights into FRBs' properties, including source population, redshift, and energy distribution. We use a simplified model of FRB source population and intrinsic Schechter function-like energy distribution, coupled with a thorough assessment of various contributors to dispersion and scattering, to replicate the joint distribution of DM and $\tau$ in the CHIME/FRB catalog. A mixed FRB source population, including both young and old progenitors, is considered. Contributions to the DM and $\tau$ from interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM) within host and foreground halos are informed by the IllustrisTNG simulation, while contributions from the Milky Way, intergalactic medium (IGM), and local environmental are estimated by updated models. Using MCMC simulations, we identify optimal model that well reproduce the DM distribution and broadly reproduce the $\tau$ distribution in the CHIME/FRB catalog. Our model suggests that the fraction of FRBs tracing star-formation rate is $\rm{f_{PSFR}=0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.27}}$, while $\rm{log_{10}E_*[erg]=42.27^{+1.17}_{-1.18}}$ and $\gamma=-1.60^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ in the energy distribution function. Scattering predominantly arises from the circumburst medium or the ISM and CGM of hosts, which cause a DM of $\sim 10\, \rm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Using our optimal model, we estimate FRB redshifts with two methods: DM-only and combined DM-$\tau$. Evaluation with 68 localized FRBs reveals an RMS error $0.11-0.12$, and incorporation of $\tau$ has a minor effect. We further argue that the host galaxy properties of localized FRBs could be a potential tool to validate our model in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 While cloud-cloud collisions (CCCs) have been proposed as a mechanism for triggering massive star formation, it is suggested that higher collision velocities ($v_{\rm col}$) and lower GMC mass ($M_{\rm GMC}$) or/and density ($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$) tend to suppress star formation. In this study, we choose the nearby barred galaxy NGC 3627 to examine the SFR and SFE of a colliding GMC ($m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$) and explore the connections between $m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$, $M_{\rm GMC}$($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$) and $v_{\rm col}$, and galactic structures (disk, bar, and bar-end). Using ALMA CO(2--1) data (60~pc resolution), we estimated $v_{\rm col}$ within 500~pc apertures, based on line-of-sight GMC velocities, assuming random motion in a two-dimensional plane. We extracted apertures where at least 0.1 collisions occur per 1 Myr, identifying them as regions dominated by CCC-driven star formation, and then calculated $m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$ using attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$ data from VLT MUSE. We found that both $m^\star_{\rm CCC}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm CCC}$ are lower in the bar (median values: $10^{3.84}~M_\odot$ and $0.18~\%$), and higher in the bar-end ($10^{4.89}~M_\odot$ and $1.10~\%$) compared to the disk ($10^{4.28}~M_\odot$ and $0.75~\%$). Furthermore, we found that structural differences within the parameter space of $v_{\rm col}$ and $M_{\rm GMC}$($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$), with higher $M_{\rm GMC}$($\Sigma_{\rm GMC}$) in the bar-end and higher $v_{\rm col}$ in the bar compared to the disk, lead to higher star formation activity in the bar-end and lower activity in the bar. Our results support the scenario that variations in CCC properties across different galactic structures can explain the observed differences in SFE on a kpc scale within a disk galaxy.
#### PAH carbon accretion and return to the diffuse interstellar medium

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06248

 - **Abstract**
 Two key questions of the chemistry of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) are addressed: i) the way carbon is returned from PAHs to the interstellar gas after the very efficient accretion of C+ ions onto PAHs; ii) the PAH contribution to the high abundance of small carbon molecules observed in UV-irradiated regions. They are addressed based on the structure and stability of the various isomers of the complexes formed by PAHs and their cations with atomic carbon. Carbon complexes with coronene are studied by B3LYP/6-311+ZPVE(B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations, in order to figure out the behaviour of C+ and C complexes with larger pericondensed interstellar PAHs, which are thought to be dominant in the ISM. The most stable forms of [C-coronene]+ cation include 7C and 4C rings, C+ insertion into a CH bond, and a 5C ring with a short exocyclic cumulene chain, and similarly for neutral [C-coronene]. The subsequent evolution of similar complexes with pericondensed PAHs, in diffuse clouds, is discussed under the action of interstellar UV photons and H atoms, as function of the PAH size. Despite the complexity of such a processing, it seems probable that, for small PAHs, these complexes efficiently lose a C2H2 molecule from repeated photodissociations. However, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by the identification of reaction paths and the computation of activation energies. The case of the evolution of larger [C-PAH] complexes is less clear. Such a processing may explain the observed balance between C+ and PAHs, at least in the diffuse ISM. Such a formation of C2H2 from PAH catalysis is a key input for the chemistry of small carbon molecules in diffuse clouds. C+ accretion might frequently form stable PAHs that contain a peripheral pentagonal ring and form a significant fraction of interstellar PAHs.
#### MAD accretion and AGN jets - an observational perspective

 - **Abstract**
 One of the major open questions related to the production of jets by accreting black holes is: why do sources with similar accretion powers produce so vastly different jet powers? What conditions are required to make a powerful jet? If jets are powered by the Blandford-Zjanek mechanism, two further parameters control the jet power besides the black hole mass - black hole spin and the magnetic flux threading it. Since highly spinning black holes without jets appear to exist, the jet production efficiency may depend on whether the black hole managed to accrete high enough magnetic flux in the past. The highest-efficiency jets in this picture are launched from magnetically arrested disks (MADs). Here we discuss a method to test this hypothesis using VLBI core-shift measurements to estimate the jet magnetic flux.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the potential of new adaptive optical technology to expand the detection horizon of gravitational-wave observatories. Achieving greater quantum-noise-limited sensitivity to spacetime strain hinges on achieving higher circulating laser power, in excess of 1~MW, in conjunction with highly-squeezed quantum states of light. The new technology will enable significantly higher levels of laser power and squeezing in gravitational-wave detectors, by providing high-precision, low-noise correction of limiting sources of thermal distortions directly to the core interferometer optics. In simulated projections for LIGO~A+, assuming an input laser power of 125~W and an effective injected squeezing level of 9~dB entering the interferometer, an initial concept of this technology can reduce the noise floor of the detectors by up to 20\% from 200~Hz to 5~kHz, corresponding to an increment of 4~Mpc in the sky-averaged detection range for binary neutron star mergers. This work lays the foundation for one of the key technology improvements essential to fully utilize the scientific potential of the existing 4-km LIGO facilities, to observe black hole merger events past a redshift of~5, and opens a realistic pathway towards a next-generation 40-km gravitational-wave observatory in the United States, Cosmic~Explorer.
