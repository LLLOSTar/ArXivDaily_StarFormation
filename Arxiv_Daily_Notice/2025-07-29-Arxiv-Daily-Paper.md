 - **Abstract**
 Numerous core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) exhibit signatures of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). Bright radio emission years after the SN is one such indication of dense CSM at large distances from the star, which may be generated via binary interactions. In this work, we use forward modeling to study the radio emission produced by interaction between the SN ejecta and CSM formed by non-conservative stable mass transfer from stripped-envelope stars in short-period binaries. The donors are among the likely progenitors of hydrogen-poor CCSNe that significantly expand $10^3$-$10^4$ years before core-collapse. We identify that non-conservative stable mass transfer from lower-mass stripped stars can create a detached shell-like CSM, whereas for our higher-mass stars the CSM is wind-like. In our models, mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ $\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ lead to dense CSM extending to $\sim 10^{18}$ $\mathrm{cm}$. The predicted radio emission is luminous at late times, reaching $L_{\nu}\sim10^{26}$-$10^{29}$ $\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ $\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at years to decades after core-collapse, which is as bright as late-time radio emission observed for a sample of hydrogen-poor SNe. However, the light curves of events with early-time data show more complex behavior in the weeks to months after core-collapse. We qualitatively demonstrate that similar early-time emission can manifest for CSM that is accelerated to speeds of $\sim10^3$ $\mathrm{km}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ upon ejection, as well as for different viewing angles in case of an asymmetric CSM distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the MINERVA survey, a 259.8 hour (prime) and 127 hour (parallel) Cycle 4 treasury program on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). MINERVA is obtaining 8 filter NIRCam medium band imaging (F140M, F162M, F182M, F210M, F250M, F300M, F360M, F460M) and 2 filter MIRI imaging (F1280W, F1500W) in four of the five CANDELS Extragalactic fields: UDS, COSMOS, AEGIS and GOODS-N. These fields were previously observed in Cycle 1 with 7 - 9 NIRCam filters by the PRIMER, CEERS and JADES programs. MINERVA reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 28.1 mag in F300M and covers $\sim$ 542 arcmin$^2$, increasing the area of existing JWST medium-band coverage in at least 8 bands by $\sim$ 7$\times$. The MIRI imaging reaches a 5$\sigma$ depth of 23.9 mag in F1280W and covers $\sim$ 275 arcmin$^2$ in at least 2 MIRI filters. When combined with existing imaging, these data will provide a photometric catalog with 20-26 JWST filters (depending on field) and 26-35 filters total, including HST. This paper presents a detailed breakdown of the filter coverage, exposure times, and field layout relative to previous observations, as well as an overview of the primary science goals of the project. These include uncovering the physics of enigmatic sources hiding in current broadband catalogs, improving systematics on stellar mass functions and number densities by factors of $\gtrsim$ 3, and resolved mapping of stellar mass and star formation at 1 $< z <$ 6. When complete, MINERVA will become an integral part of the treasury deep field imaging datasets, significantly improving population studies with well-understood completeness, robust photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and sizes, and facilitating spectroscopic follow up for decades to come.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on our finding of an excess of $54^{+16}_{-15}$ neutrinos at the location of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) G63.7+1.1. By analyzing the IceCube track-like neutrino data for a group of 14 PWNe, which are selected as the targets because of their reportedly association with molecular clouds, G63.7+1.1 is found to be the only one detected with neutrino emission and the post-trail significance for the detection is 3.2$\sigma$. Previously, this PWN was estimated to have an age of $\gtrsim$8\,kyr, contain a candidate pulsar detected in X-rays, and have a distance of $\sim$6\,kpc. More importantly and related to the PWN's possible neutrino emission, surrounding molecular materials are seen to interact with the PWN. On the basis of these properties, we examine the proton-proton interactions as the process for the neutrino production. The PWN (or the pulsar) can collectively provide sufficient energy to power the required high-energy (HE) protons. This possibly first neutrino-emitting case in our Galaxy, with problems or other possibilities to be solved or examined, may reveal to us that PWNe are the significant Galactic HE neutrino sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the nebular phase spectroscopic and photometric observations of the nearby hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova (CC-SN) 2023ixf, obtained through our JWST programs. These observations, combined with ground-based optical and near-infrared spectra, cover +252.67 - 719.96 d, creating a comprehensive, panchromatic time-series dataset spanning 0.32 - 30$\mu$m. In this second paper of the series, we focus on identifying key spectral emission features and tracking their evolution through the nebular phase. The JWST data reveal hydrogen emission from the Balmer to Humphreys series, as well as prominent forbidden lines from Ne, Ar, Fe, Co, and Ni. NIRSpec observations display strong emission from the first overtone and fundamental bands of carbon monoxide, which weaken with time as the ejecta cools and dust emission dominates. The spectral energy distribution shows a clear infrared excess emerging by +252.67 d peaking around 10.0$\mu$m, with a secondary bump at 18.0$\mu$m developing by +719.96 d. We suggest that this evolution could arises from multiple warm dust components. In upcoming papers in this series, we will present detailed modeling of the molecular and dust properties. Overall, this dataset significantly advances our understanding of the mid-infrared properties of CC-SNe, providing an unprecedented view of their late-time line, molecule, and dust emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted VLBA 1.4 GHz (L-band) continuum observations towards twelve sources with HI 21-cm absorption detections at redshift $0.4<z<0.7$ in the pilot surveys of FLASH, an ongoing survey with the ASKAP radio telescope. 11 of the 12 targets are resolved in the VLBA observations. Using the parsec scale radio images, we have classified the source morphology and identified the radio core. Six of the twelve targets have core-jet morphology, four have two-sided jet morphology, one has a complex morphology, and one is unresolved. We describe a methodology to test whether the emission from the core or the total emission detected in the VLBA image has sufficient flux density to cause the entire HI 21-cm absorption, and we estimate limits on the gas covering factor and velocity-integrated optical depth (VOD). We find that for seven of the twelve sources, the core has sufficient flux density to cause all the HI 21-cm absorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum. For three other targets, with projected sizes in the range $\rm 305-409 \ pc$, a large fraction of the entire emission in the VLBA map could be occulted by the gas. For 0903+010 (NVSS J090331+010846), we estimate that at least $\approx 73\%$ of the peak absorption detected in the ASKAP spectrum could arise against the emission detected in the VLBA image. For the target 0023+010 (NVSS J002331+010114), we estimate an upper limit on the VOD of $\rm 169 \ km \ s^{-1}$, the highest in our sample. For 0903+010 (NVSS J090331+010846) we estimate a lower limit of $\rm 104 \ km \ s^{-1}$ on the VOD. We find that the distribution of HI 21-cm VODs at $0.4<z<1.0$ could increase by up to a factor of three after correction for the covering factors using our VLBA measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of flare ribbon fine structure observed during a GOES C2-class flare using high spatial and spectral resolution multi-line spectropolarimetric observations from the ViSP instrument at the DKIST. The ViSP recorded full Stokes spectra in three lines: Fe I 630.2 nm line pair, Na I D1, and Ca II 854.2 nm. To infer the stratification of temperature and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity across the ribbon, we performed non-LTE multi-line inversions of ViSP spectra. In the red wing of the Ca II 854.2 nm line, we identified multiple compact, roundish, and quasi-equally spaced bright structures, referred to as ribbon blobs, embedded within the flare ribbon. The sizes of these blobs range from 320 to 455 km, and they are spaced roughly ~1100 km apart. These features exhibit complex spectral profiles with pronounced asymmetries and double peaks near the line core of the Ca II 854.2 nm line. The blob regions were found to be significantly hotter (by ~1 kK) at log {\tau} = -4 compared to surrounding ribbon areas (~7 kK). The LOS velocity maps revealed both upflows and downflows at log {\tau} = -4$ and log {\tau} = -3, respectively. We discuss the plausible origins of these fine structures in the chromosphere, which may be related to electron beam heating, plasma draining, or tearing-mode instabilities in the reconnecting current sheet.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 652 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Carina star-forming region. The catalog was constructed by combining near-infrared Ks-band variability from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended survey and medium-resolution H-band spectroscopy from APOGEE-2, Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). Variability analysis of 6.35 million sources identified 606 variable stars. The classification of the spectral lines by semisupervised K-means clustering of 704 stars, refined through comparison with known catalogs in literature and visual inspection of the spectra, was performed. Combined with Ks variability, the final catalog contains three groups: Emission-line YSOs, Absorption-line YSOs, and Literature/Variable-identified YSOs. Cross validation with the Gaia DR3 proper motion and distance estimates supports Carina membership for 415 sources. The statistical characterization of YSO variability demonstrated that most Carina members (78%) exhibit variability patterns. Of these, 134 stars show emissions in their spectra, which is consistent with some accretion processes. Analysis of fundamental stellar parameters from StarHorse and Gaia DR3 reveals typical distributions of YSOs, dominated by low-mass 1-4 Msun, solar-metallicity stars with temperatures between 4000 and 6000K. Only a small fraction (4%) of the sources are more massive than 4 Msun, suggesting limited ongoing massive star formation in Carina. This well-characterized catalog also offers a robust training dataset for machine learning applications aimed at predicting YSO behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy provides us with the unique opportunity to study an ongoing Galactic cannibalistic event between our Milky Way Galaxy and a satellite dwarf galaxy. We present the first major membership star catalog of the Sagittarius dwarf core ($\approx$400,000 sources) and Messier 54 ($\approx$2000 sources) with positions, proper motions, and parallaxes from $Gaia$ DR3, supplemented with metallicities from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We isolate the Sagittarius dwarf core (3.7 core radii) and Messier 54 (0.125 core radii) using literature positions. Using evolutionary sub-samples separated within a color-magnitude diagram, we analyze the structures and substructures of the Sagittarius core and infer its positional relationship with Messier 54 within 5D phase space. A sample of Milky Way stars from a similar galactic latitude was used to identify contaminants and separate member stars from the core of the Sgr dSph and Messier 54 using a Gaussian distribution in proper motion space. We present the derived proper motion, parallaxes, and metallicities for these evolutionary sub-samples while demonstrating the precision of our sample using red clump standard candles. We find a distance modulus for the Sagittarius core and Messier 54 of $(m-M)_{0}=17.002^{+0.038}_{-0.042}$ mag and $(m-M)_{0}=17.011^{+0.038}_{-0.039}$ mag, corresponding to a heliocentric distance of $d=25.14^{+0.45}_{-0.48}$ kpc and $d=25.25^{+0.48}_{-0.45}$ kpc respectively. With red clump distance analysis, our results imply there is no separation between the Sagittarius core and Messier 54.
#### Episodic accretion in high-mass star formation: An analysis of thermal instability for axially symmetric disks

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass young stellar objects exhibit episodic accretion bursts similar to their low-mass counterparts. Understanding these outbursts is crucial for elucidating massive star formation and disk evolution around high-mass protostars. We investigate thermal instability's role in triggering accretion outbursts using a two-dimensional hydrodynamical model that fully resolves the vertical structure of the inner disk. This approach provides a more realistic depiction of axially symmetric disk dynamics and assesses observable burst signatures. We simulate the inner 10 astronomical units of a circumstellar disk around a high-mass protostar, incorporating viscous heating and radiative transport in radial and vertical directions. Unlike previous one-dimensional studies, our two-dimensional model resolves time-dependent vertical disk structure, capturing complex radial-vertical dynamics. Our simulations show thermal instability causes significant structural changes. Steep temperature gradients and vigorous convection develop at outburst onset, with gas flows differing between midplane and upper layers. Energy release produces 15-30 year outbursts with peak accretion rates of $2-3\times10^{-4}~\rm M_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. While observable, these bursts are insufficiently bright with rise times differing from rapid observed events. Our models lack the "reflares" seen in one-dimensional calculations. Resolving full vertical disk structure is essential for accurate thermal instability modeling. While thermal instability significantly influences episodic accretion, it appears insufficient alone to explain observed HMYSO outburst diversity. Additional mechanisms are required for comprehensive understanding.
#### Mixing due to internal gravity waves can explain the CNO surface abundances of B-type detached eclipsing binaries and single stars

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries are ideal to study stellar evolution. They have tight model-independent constraints on their masses and radii. With the addition of spectroscopically determined effective temperatures and surface abundances, they can be used to calibrate and improve models. Here we determine whether the observed trends of surface nitrogen abundance in single and binary stars can be explained by wave-induced mixing occurring in the stellar envelope. We use MESA to run the simulations. We compare the outcome of the models to observations of the surface nitrogen abundance for samples of detached eclipsing binary systems and of single B-type stars. From this we determine the amount of wave-induced mixing required to bring the model predictions in agreement with the observations. We find nitrogen to be enriched at the surface of theoretical models with wave-induced mixing provided that we use levels above log(Denv)=5-6 at the convective core boundary. A prominent observation is that the B-type components of detached eclipsing binaries do not show any nitrogen surface enhancement, which can be explained by their relatively fast rotation enforced by the tidal forces in the systems. The slowly rotating or evolved stars among the sample of single B stars do reveal a nitrogen enhancement. Our findings on the difference between single B stars and B-type components of detached binary systems can potentially be explained by internal wave-induced mixing profiles based on recent 2-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of rotating B stars. Such wave-induced mixing decreases with increasing rotation and may act in combination with additional rotational mixing. Our findings motivate future asteroseismic studies in samples of single B stars and pulsating eclipsing binaries with B-type components as optimal laboratories to further test our interpretations.
#### X-ray Emission from Type Ia Supernova Remnants Interacting With Isotropic Progenitor Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes. Here we focus on the impact that uniform and isotropic outflows have on the circumstellar environment of Type Ia supernova progenitors. We vary mass loss rate, wind velocity, and outflow duration, and evolve supernova remnant (SNR) models in this grid of circumstellar structures in order to compare the bulk properties of these models (ages, radii, and \feka\ centroids and luminosities) to observations. We find that roughly 50\% of young Type Ia SNRs in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud had progenitors that did not substantially modify their surroundings on $\sim$pc scales. This group includes SN Ia with a range of luminosities, and at least some likely products of double detonation explosions in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs. The other half of our sample can be divided in two distinct classes. A small subset of SNRs ($\sim$15\%) have large radii and low \feka\ centroids and are likely expanding into large cavities excavated by fast ($\sim$1000 km/s), sustained progenitor outflows. The majority of the SNRs that are expanding into a modified medium ($\sim35\%$) show evidence for dense material, likely associated with slow ($\sim$10 km/s) progenitor outflows, possibly a byproduct of accretion processes in near-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs spawned by younger stellar populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold gas clouds embedded in a hot, turbulent medium are expected to be short-lived due to disruptive hydrodynamic instabilities. However, radiative cooling might allow such clouds to survive and grow. We present 3D \texttt{Athena++} simulations of clouds with a density contrast of $\chi = 1000$, exploring turbulent Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}\in (0.25, 0.75)$ and cloud radii chosen to span cooling-to-crushing ratios $\alpha \in [0.001, 10]$. We find a shift in the survival boundary, with cloud survival occurring only when the cooling-to-cloud-crushing ratio ($t_{\text{cool,mix}} / t_{\text{cc}}$) $\lesssim 0.01$, which is lower than the expected boundary of $\sim 1$. This result shows that it is more difficult for higher over-density cold clouds to survive in a turbulent, hot medium, and suggests another `survival criterion'.

 - **Abstract**
 In cold molecular clouds, UV photolysis of icy grain mantles generates radicals that lead to new molecule formation. When radical diffusion is limited by low temperatures, oxygen atom addition and insertion reactions, enabled by photolysis of common ice components such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and O$_3$, offer an alternative route to chemical complexity through the production of metastable, highly reactive O($^{1}D$) atoms. We examine the reactivity of these oxygen atoms generated by UV photolysis of O$_3$ with methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN). These studies are conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at cryogenic and low-pressure conditions equipped with in situ infrared spectroscopy to monitor destruction and product formation in real time. We conclude that oxygen atoms rapidly insert into CH$_3$CN to produce primarily methyl isocyanate (CH$_3$NCO) in matrix free ices. Over the range from 10 K to 40 K, we observe no temperature dependence to either CH$_3$CN destruction or CH$_3$NCO production. When placing CH$_3$CN:O$_3$ in H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ice matrices, we find that CH$_3$NCO formation remains robust, but that the yield likely decreases due to competing reaction pathways. In the case of the H$_2$O ice we also observe a shift in product branching ratios towards alternative pathways such as the formation of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN). Overall, our results demonstrate that oxygen atom reactivity provides an important channel for generating chemical complexity from nitriles on cold grains where radical mobility is limited.
