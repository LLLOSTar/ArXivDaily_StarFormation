#### Commissioning of a Commercial CMOS Camera for the Application of Lucky Image Technique on the Lulin One-meter Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 Lucky image (LI) is a technique to achieve near diffraction-limit high-angular resolution images for meter-class optical telescopes. In this work, by observing the core of globular cluster M15, we demonstrated the LI technique can be applied to a 1-meter telescope, the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT), together with a commercial-grade CMOS camera. We have also developed a method to sort the quality of the LI frames by measuring the mean intensity per pixel on the selected reference stars. For a LI-reconstructed image based on the best 10\%-selected frames, we achieved a $1.7\times$ improvement on the full-width at half-maximum over the conventional long-exposure image. When cross-matched the detected sources on the LI-reconstructed image to the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog, we obtained a mean difference of $-0.04\pm0.09$" and $-0.02\pm0.09$" on the right ascension and declination, respectively, as well as reaching to a $5\sigma$ depth of $\sim 17.9$ mag in the Gaia $G$-band.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions often show material accumulation near the co-orbital Lagrange points $L_4$ and $L_5$ -- features that may correspond to observed crescents in protoplanetary disks. Intriguingly, these simulations also show an asymmetrical distribution of gas between $L_4$ and $L_5$, whose physical origin is not yet understood and could allow to further constrain the inner workings of planet-disk interactions. We performed 2D hydrodynamic simulations of a single, non-migrating planet embedded in a gaseous disk to investigate this effect. We find that the asymmetry is solely controlled by the sign of the radial temperature gradient with positive gradients enhancing the accumulation at $L_4$ and negative ones enhancing $L_5$. A symmetric distribution is recovered on globally isothermal disks. Furthermore, we find that the azimuthal locations of $L_4$ and $L_5$ deviate from the classical circular restricted three-body problem, following a monotonic trend with the disk pressure scale height $h_{\rm p}$: $\phi_{\text{max}}\approx\pm60^{\circ}[1+0.18(h_{\rm p}^3M_\star/m_{\rm p})^{2/3}]$. Our simulations show that the longest-lived and largest-amplitude structures are produced by planets opening gaps with depths $\Sigma_{\rm gap}/\Sigma_0\lesssim 0.2$. We successfully reproduce the observed asymmetry using a semi-analytical model that incorporates the azimuthally asymmetric radial velocity background induced by the planet. Overall, our results suggest that asymmetries in the form of crescents and clumps inside of density gaps opened by planets can constrain the local thermodynamic properties of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Very massive stars (VMSs, $M_{\star}$ $\geq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$) play a crucial role in several astrophysical processes. At low metallicity, they might collapse directly into black holes, or end their lives as pair-instability supernovae. Recent observational results set an upper limit of $0.7\,{}\mathrm{ yr}^{-1} \,{}\mathrm{ Gpc}^{-3}$ on the rate density of pair-instability supernovae in the nearby Universe. However, most theoretical models predict rates exceeding this limit. Here, we compute new VMS tracks with the MESA code, and use them to analyze the evolution of the (pulsational) pair-instability supernova rate density across cosmic time. We show that stellar wind models accounting for the transition between optically thin and thick winds yield a pair-instability supernova rate $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{PISN}}\sim{}0.1$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at redshift $z\sim{}0$, about two orders of magnitude lower than our previous models. We find that the main contribution to the pair-instability supernova rate comes from stars with metallicity $Z\sim{}0.001-0.002$. Stars with higher metallicities cannot enter the pair-instability supernova regime, even if their zero-age main sequence mass is up to 500 M$_\odot$. The main reason is that VMSs enter the regime for optically thick winds during the main sequence at metallicity as low as $Z\sim{4}\times{}10^{-4}$. This enhances the mass loss rate, quenching the growth of the He core and thus preventing the onset of pair-instability in later evolutionary stages. This result highlights the critical role of mass loss in shaping the final fate of very massive stars and the rate of pair-instability supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star. Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results. MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission (CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust extinction of the upper layers [abridged].

 - **Abstract**
 The data release six of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and the second data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2) recently became available. In light of these data, we update constraints on the Early Dark Energy (EDE) resolution to the Hubble tension. While ACT DR6 does not favor EDE over the core cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, it allows for a significantly larger maximum contribution of EDE, $f_{\rm EDE}$, in the pre-recombination era than the latest analysis of {\it Planck} NPIPE despite increased precision at small angular scales. Moreover, EDE rises the value of $H_0r_s$, improving consistency between CMB and DESI DR2 data. We find a residual tension with SH0ES of $\sim 2 \sigma$ for the combination of {\it Planck} at $\ell <1000$ + ACT DR6 + lensing + Pantheon-plus + DESI DR2, a significant decrease from $3.7 \sigma$ for analyses that use NPIPE and SDSS BAO data. A profile likelihood analysis reveals significant prior-volume effects in Bayesian analyses which do not include SH$0$ES, with confidence intervals of $f_{\rm EDE}=0.09\pm 0.03$ and $H_0= 71.0\pm1.1$ km/s/Mpc. When including DESI data, the EDE model with $H_0=73$ km/s/Mpc provides a better fit than the $\Lambda$CDM model with $H_0=68.4$ km/s/Mpc. The inclusion of SH$0$ES data rises the preference well above $5\sigma$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-35.4$. Our work demonstrates that after ACT DR6 and DESI DR2, EDE remains a potential resolution to the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation, dynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between cluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of the layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the three-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the formation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial distribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a layered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd N-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the correlation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius of the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals that OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results from N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is strongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star and the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova explosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore, clusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure, likely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations caused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse and slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive stars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption of the layered structure in OCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations from the Juno spacecraft show that Jupiter has a large dilute core rather than a compact core. To investigate the effects of different core structures on wave propagation and transmission in Jupiter's interior, we consider three models: (1) an isentropic sphere, (2) an isentropic envelope with a rigid core, and (3) an isentropic envelope with a dilute core. We study the propagation and transmission of p modes (sound waves), g modes (gravity waves), r modes (inertial waves), and GIWs (gravito-inertial waves) by solving the linear equations of a compressible, self-gravitating, uniformly rotating polytropic model, fully taking into account the the effects of Coriolis force but neglecting centrifugal flattening. Our results show that energy flux is primarily carried by fast waves with higher frequencies whereas kinetic energy by slow waves with lower frequencies. Rotation has a greater effect on non-axisymmetric modes than on axisymmetric ones. In model 2, rigid core facilitates propagation of r modes. In model 3, rotation enhances the transmission of GIWs across the interface between the dilute core and the isentropic envelope, particularly at high latitudes. This suggests that Jupiter's internal structure may be inferred by detecting the oscillation signals in its polar regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) offers powerful new capabilities for studying the polarised and magnetised Universe at radio wavelengths. In this paper, we introduce the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM), a groundbreaking survey with three primary objectives: (1) to create a comprehensive Faraday rotation measure (RM) grid of up to one million compact extragalactic sources across the southern ~50 per cent of the sky (20,630 deg$^2$); (2) to map the intrinsic polarisation and RM properties of a wide range of discrete extragalactic and Galactic objects over the same area; and (3) to contribute interferometric data with excellent surface brightness sensitivity, which can be combined with single-dish data to study the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium. Observations for the full POSSUM survey commenced in May 2023 and are expected to conclude by mid-2028. POSSUM will achieve an RM grid density of around 30-50 RMs per square degree with a median measurement uncertainty of ~1 rad m$^{-2}$. The survey operates primarily over a frequency range of 800-1088 MHz, with an angular resolution of 20'' and a typical RMS sensitivity in Stokes $Q$ or $U$ of 18 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Additionally, the survey will be supplemented by similar observations covering 1296-1440 MHz over 38 per cent of the sky. POSSUM will enable the discovery and detailed investigation of magnetised phenomena in a wide range of cosmic environments, as well as the interplay between these components. This paper reviews the current science case developed by the POSSUM Collaboration and provides an overview of POSSUM's observations, data processing, outputs, and its complementarity with other radio and multi-wavelength surveys, including future work with the SKA.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify stellar tidal debris from the $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) system among field stars in the APOGEE survey via chemical tagging using a neural network trained on APOGEE observations of the $\omega$ Cen core. We find a total of 463 $\omega$ Cen debris candidates have a probability $P > 0.8$ of sharing common patterns in their chemical abundances across a range of individual elements or element combinations, including [C+N], O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ni, and Fe. Some debris candidates show prograde or retrograde disk-like kinematics, but most show kinematics consistent with the accreted halo, showing high radial actions, $J_{R}$, values. We find that a sample of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GES) members are chemically distinct from the $\omega$ Cen core, suggesting that $\omega$ Cen is associated to an independent merger event shaping the Milky Way halo. However, a connection between GSE and $\omega$ Cen cannot be ruled out. A detailed comparison with $N$-body simulations indicates that the $\omega$ Cen progenitor was a massive dwarf galaxy ($\gtrsim 10^8 M_{\odot}$). The existence of a metal-poor high-$\alpha$ chemically homogeneous halo debris is also reported.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The outer Milky Way has a lower metallicity than our solar neighbourhood, but still many molecules are detected in the region. Molecular line ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics in these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9 different molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection between the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen chemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated using UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and carbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a classical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning, namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order dependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction method to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the parameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate all input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are the most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important in parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different types of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly sensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the temperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to be sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for this parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen abundance.
#### The present-day cosmic phosphorus abundance

 - **Abstract**
 The present-day phosphorus abundance in the solar neighbourhood is determined from a sample of OB-type stars. This is in order to constrain the endpoint of the galactochemical evolution of phosphorus in the course of stellar nucleosynthesis over cosmic time and to provide an abundance baseline for the study of the depletion of phosphorus onto dust grains in the interstellar medium. A model atom for P II/III/IV based on a comprehensive new set of ab initio data for line transitions, photoionisations and electron-impact excitation was developed. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation calculations with the codes DETAIL and SURFACE were conducted, based on LTE line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code. High-resolution optical spectra for a sample of 42 apparently slowly rotating main-sequence OB-type stars and B-type supergiants in the solar vicinity within ~500 pc and beyond, out to a distance of ~2 kpc, were analysed. The non-LTE effects on the formation of the P II/III/IV lines are discussed. Non-LTE effects on the stellar abundances range from zero to ~0.3 dex. Where available in the spectra, ionisation balance between two phosphorus ionic species is achieved. Accurate and precise abundances are provided for the sample stars, statistical and systematic 1 sigma uncertainties are typically each well below 0.1 dex. The present-day cosmic phosphorus abundance in the solar neighbourhood is constrained to log(P/H)+12 = 5.36 +- 0.14, which is compatible with the solar photospheric abundance, but lower than derived by LTE analyses of neutral phosphorus lines in solar-type stars. The amount of phosphorus depleted onto dust grains is ~0.25 dex.
#### Cracking the relation between mass and 1P-star fraction of globular clusters: III. Initial distributions of in-situ and ex-situ clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic globular clusters consist of two main stellar populations, the pristine (1P) and polluted (2P) stars. The fraction of 1P stars in clusters, $F_{1P}$, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, $m_{prst}$. The information about cluster formation it contains has yet to be unlocked. Paper I demonstrated that the observed distribution $(m_{prst},F_{1P})$ of Galactic globular clusters can result from a pristine-star fraction that is inversely proportional to their birth mass, $m_{ecl}$. This relation was then calibrated with a fixed stellar mass threshold for 2P-star formation, $m_{th}$, i.e., $F_{1P}=m_{th}/m_{ecl}$. We now estimate the masses $m_{init}$ of Galactic globular clusters as they start their long-term gas-free evolution in the Galaxy and we map their behavior in the $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ space. Several dissolution time-scales are tested (with and without primordial mass segregation), each yielding its own initial cluster distribution $(m_{init},F_{1P})$. The $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ distributions are mapped according to cluster origin, with the emphasis on the Disk, Low-Energy and Gaia-Enceladus cluster groups of Massari et al. (2019). All three initial distributions $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ are more compact than their present-day counterparts since dynamical evolution scatters clusters in the $F_{1P}$ versus cluster-mass space. The Disk initial distribution is the tightest one and potential reasons for this are discussed. Its power-law representation allows us to generalize the initial mass threshold of Paper I and prompts us to represent the cluster $({\rm mass},F_{1P})$ distribution in a log-log space. No evidence is found suggesting that, initially, the pristine-star fraction of globular clusters depends on their metallicity on top of their mass.
#### Be star demographics: a comprehensive study of thousands of lightcurves in the Magellanic Clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-color OGLE survey light curves of about 20 years duration are analyzed for about 3000 classical Be stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) in order to study the properties and variability. Each light curve was manually analyzed to distinguish between different scenarios, such as photospheric baseline levels, and disk build-up and dissipation phases. This analysis was aided by dynamical disk models and photospheric models to coarsely determine inclination angle and mass. Measured quantities such as the fraction of time spent actively ejecting mass (the duty cycle), the fraction of time spent with a detectable disk (the disk duty cycle), the build-up and dissipation time of isolated disk events, and the number of mass outbursts per year allow us to characterize and compare the behavior of the two populations. There is a wide spread in the duty cycle, with median values of 0.44 (LMC) and 0.60 (SMC). The disk duty cycle is high for both populations, with median values of 0.99 (LMC) and 1.0 (SMC), indicating that disks are almost always present for these stars. The occurrence rate of outbursts ranges from zero to about two per year, with median values of 0.31 (LMC) and 0.26 (SMC). There are strong statistical differences in the behavior of the LMC and SMC populations, with the lower metallicity stars being more active in terms of their duty cycle and disk duty cycle, and with less frequent but longer lasting outbursts.
#### Modeling the Light Curve and Spectra of SN 2023aew

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the delayed conversion of a neutron star (NS) into either a quark star (QS) or a hybrid star (HS), occurring approximately 105-109 days after the supernova (SN) explosion, injects ~ 2e49 erg of thermal energy into the expanded SN ejecta. This energy, delivered over ~ 40 days via a quark-nova (QN) shock or the spin-down power of the HS, can reproduce the photometric and spectral features observed in SN 2023aew. In this model, the first light curve peak corresponds to the 56Ni-powered SN resulting from a stripped-envelope progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of at least ~ (15-16)M_sun. The plateau between the two peaks may result from interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Alternatively, it could be explained by the spin-down power of the NS prior to its conversion into a highly magnetized HS, which is responsible for powering the second bump. A scenario involving two phases of spin-down power - first from the NS and later from the HS - is compelling and supports the hypothesis that some magnetars are, in fact, HSs. These HSs acquire their ultra-strong magnetic fields through a quark matter phase capable of sustaining core fields on the order of ~ 1e18 G. In our model, the spin-down energy of the HS powers the QN ejecta - the outermost layers of the NS - before this energy is transferred to the expanded SN ejecta. This process produces luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The model establishes a potential connection between superluminous SNe (SLSNe) and LFBOTs, with significant implications for high-energy astrophysics and the r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Potential consequences for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Five Venus missions are under development to study the planet in the next decade, with both NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision featuring a geophysical investigation among their objectives. Their radar and gravity experiments will determine Venus's orientation, enabling spin dynamics analyses to infer geophysical and atmospheric properties. This work aims to characterize Venus's polar motion -- the motion of its spin axis in a body-fixed frame-focusing on signatures from its interior and atmosphere to support its potential detection by future orbiters. We develop a polar motion model for a triaxial planet accounting for solar torque, centrifugal and tidal deformations of a viscoelastic mantle, and atmospheric dynamics. Core-mantle coupling effects are analyzed separately considering a simplified spherical core. We compute the period and damping time of the free motion -- called the Chandler wobble -- and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the forced motion. We revisit the Chandler frequency expression. Solar torque is the dominant phenomenon affecting Venus's Chandler frequency, increasing it by a factor of 2.75. Our model predicts a Chandler period in the range [12900 ; 18900] years. The Chandler wobble appears as a linear polar drift of about 90 meters on Venus's surface during EnVision's 4-year primary mission, at the limit of its resolution. We also predict forced polar motion oscillations with an amplitude of about 20 meters, driven by the atmosphere and the solar torque. Compared to the 240-meter spin axis precession occurring in inertial space over this duration, these results suggest that Venus's polar motion could also be detectable by future orbiters. It should be incorporated into rotation models when anticipating these missions, providing additional constraints on Venus's interior structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) are short-lived X-ray outbursts with diverse progenitor scenarios, including compact object mergers, stellar core-collapses and tidal disruption events. The Einstein Probe (EP) has enabled the rapid discovery and follow-up of dozens of FXRTs, revealing that while some of them overlap with traditional gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a larger fraction of FXRTs have no associated gamma-ray counterpart down to deep limits. The origin of these gamma-ray dark FXRTs and their connection to the diverse landscape of stellar explosions remains an open question, which can be tackled through the study of their multi-wavelength counterparts and environment. In this paper, we present long-term radio observations of the gamma-ray dark EP241021a, which exhibits sustained radio emission for over 100 days, placing it among the longest-lived radio afterglows. We detect signature of interstellar scintillation in early epochs, allowing us to constrain the angular size and Lorentz factor of the emitting region. Our observations point to an outflow that is at least mildly relativistic with Lorentz factor > 4. Afterglow modeling favors a moderately relativistic and collimated outflow interacting with a low-density interstellar medium. The derived beaming-corrected kinetic energy and low radiative efficiency are consistent with a standard relativistic explosion which did not produce bright gamma-rays. Alternatively, a highly-relativistic structured jet remains consistent with our observations if seen substantially off-axis. In the latter case, the initial X-ray flare detected by EP would be caused by the slower ejecta from the lateral wings intercepting our line of sight rather than by traditional prompt-emission mechanisms within the jet core.
