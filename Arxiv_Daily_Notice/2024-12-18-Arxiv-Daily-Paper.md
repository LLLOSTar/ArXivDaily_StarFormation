 - **Abstract**
 Classifying variable stars is key for understanding stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. With the demands of large astronomical surveys, machine learning models, especially attention-based neural networks, have become the state-of-the-art. While achieving high accuracy is crucial, enhancing model interpretability and uncertainty estimation is equally important to ensure that insights are both reliable and comprehensible. We aim to enhance transformer-based models for classifying astronomical light curves by incorporating uncertainty estimation techniques to detect misclassified instances. We tested our methods on labeled datasets from MACHO, OGLE-III, and ATLAS, introducing a framework that significantly improves the reliability of automated classification for the next-generation surveys. We used Astromer, a transformer-based encoder designed for capturing representations of single-band light curves. We enhanced its capabilities by applying three methods for quantifying uncertainty: Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout), Hierarchical Stochastic Attention (HSA), and a novel hybrid method combining both approaches, which we have named Hierarchical Attention with Monte Carlo Dropout (HA-MC Dropout). We compared these methods against a baseline of deep ensembles (DEs). To estimate uncertainty estimation scores for the misclassification task, we selected Sampled Maximum Probability (SMP), Probability Variance (PV), and Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) as uncertainty estimates. In predictive performance tests, HA-MC Dropout outperforms the baseline, achieving macro F1-scores of 79.8+-0.5 on OGLE, 84+-1.3 on ATLAS, and 76.6+-1.8 on MACHO. When comparing the PV score values, the quality of uncertainty estimation by HA-MC Dropout surpasses that of all other methods, with improvements of 2.5+-2.3 for MACHO, 3.3+-2.1 for ATLAS and 8.5+-1.6 for OGLE-III.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-density and unbound stellar groups, OB associations have been historically delineated through their bright and massive members. They have been analysed for decades, but the arrival of Hipparcos, and more recently of Gaia led to a change of paradigm by allowing the identification of more reliable members using parallaxes and proper motions. This renewed interest offers an opportunity to emphasize the role of OB associations across many areas of astronomy. In this review, I highlight their importance across multiple scales: how OB associations constitute suitable sites to study massive stars and stellar multiplicity, their relation with star clusters, their interactions with the interstellar medium through the feedback of their massive members, and how they shape the structure and evolution of the Milky Way and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST-NIRCam narrow-band, 4.05 $\mu$m Brackett-$\alpha$ images of the Sgr C HII region, located in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy. Unlike any HII region in the Solar vicinity, the Sgr C plasma is dominated by filamentary structure in both Brackett-$\alpha$ and the radio continuum. Some bright filaments, which form a fractured arc with a radius of about 1.85 pc centered on the Sgr C star-forming molecular clump, likely trace ionization fronts. The brightest filaments form a `$\pi$-shaped' structure in the center of the HII region. Fainter filaments radiate away from the surface of the Sgr C molecular cloud. The filaments are emitting optically thin free-free emission, as revealed by spectral index measurements from 1.28 GHz (MeerKAT) to 97 GHz (ALMA). But, the negative in-band 1 to 2 GHz spectral index in the MeerKAT data alone reveals the presence of a non-thermal component across the entire Sgr C HII region. We argue that the plasma flow in Sgr C is controlled by magnetic fields, which confine the plasma to rope-like filaments or sheets. This results in the measured non-thermal component of low-frequency radio emission plasma, as well as a plasma $\beta$ (thermal pressure divided by magnetic pressure) below 1, even in the densest regions. We speculate that all mature HII regions in the CMZ, and galactic nuclei in general, evolve in a magnetically dominated, low plasma $\beta$ regime.
#### Planet formation theory: an overview

 - **Abstract**
 The standard model for planet formation is a bottom-up process in which the origin of rocky and gaseous planets can be traced back to the collision of micron-sized dust grains within the gas-rich environment of protoplanetary disks. Key milestones along the way include disk formation, grain growth, planetesimal formation, core growth, gas accretion, and planetary system evolution. I provide an introductory overview of planet formation, emphasizing the main ideas and reviewing current theoretical understanding. Many of the phases of planet formation have a well-developed physical understanding, though the complexity of the problem means that few can be quantitatively modeled with complete confidence. Transformative advances in disk imaging and exoplanet detection provide the first direct information on the initial conditions for planet formation, and have motivated new formation models that are faster, more efficient, and lead to a more diverse set of architectures than their Solar System inspired forebears. Much remains to be learned, and I close with a personal, incomplete list, of open problems.

 - **Abstract**
 A core sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs with simultaneous XMM-Newton X-ray and UV observations is compiled from archive to probe the nature of soft X-ray excess (SE). In the first paper of this series, our focus centers on scrutinizing the spectral profile of the soft excess. Of the sources, $\approx$ 71% (42/59) exhibit powerlaw-like (po-like) soft excess, while $\approx$ 29% (17/59) exhibit blackbody-like (bb-like) soft excess. We show a cut-off powerlaw could uniformly characterize both types of soft excesses, with median Ecut of 1.40 keV for po-like and 0.14 keV for bb-like. For the first time, we report a robust and quantitative correlation between the SE profile and SE strength (the ratio of SE luminosity to that of the primary powerlaw continuum in 0.5 - 2.0 keV), indicating that stronger soft excess is more likely to be po-like, or effectively has a higher Ecut. This correlation cannot be explained by ionized disk reflection alone, which produces mostly bb-like soft excess (Ecut $\sim$ 0.1 keV) as revealed by relxilllp simulation. Remarkably, we show with simulations that a toy hybrid scenario, where both ionized disk reflection (relxilllp, with all reflection parameters fixed at default values except for ionization of the disk) and warm corona (compTT, with temperature fixed at 1 keV) contribute to the observed soft excess, can successfully reproduce the observed correlation. This highlights the ubiquitous hybrid nature of the soft X-ray excess in AGNs, and underscores the importance of considering both components while fitting the spectra of soft excess.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters host large populations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) due to their high gravitational encounter rates, producing many binary systems and thus MSPs via the recycling process. Seven pulsars with spin periods ranging from 3 ms to 134 ms have been discovered in Terzan 1, which was targeted for pulsar searches with the Green Bank Telescope after Australia Telescope Compact Array imaging revealed steep-spectrum point sources in the cluster core. We have obtained timing observations over seven years, for the first seven Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discoveries (Terzan 1 A through G), using the GBT and Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. All seven pulsars are isolated, consistent with Terzan 1's classification as a core-collapsed cluster (core collapse is predicted to disrupt, or ionize, binaries). With these timing solutions, we measured the positions and observed period derivatives, dP/dt, for each pulsar. The measured dP/dt values are composed of intrinsic spin-down and accelerations experienced by the pulsars (primarily from the cluster's gravitational potential), and they can be used to infer line-of-sight accelerations. We attempted to constrain the radius and density of the cluster core using these inferred accelerations. A wide range of radii and densities are possible, pointing to the need for continued timing as well as new discoveries to better constrain these cluster properties. We additionally find that Ter 1 A may be younger than the cluster and thus may have formed via a formation channel other than a core-collapse supernova. Theoretical formation mechanisms such as electron-capture supernovae from accretion- or merger-induced collapse of white dwarfs could potentially explain these pulsars' origins. It may therefore be a member of a small but growing class of globular cluster pulsars that appear to be significantly younger than their host clusters.
#### Testing the asteroseismic estimates of stellar radii with surface brightness-colour relations and {\it Gaia} DR3 parallaxes. II. Red giants and red clump stars from the {\it Kepler} catalogue

 - **Abstract**
 A recent investigation highlighted peculiar trends between the radii derived from surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) combined with Gaia DR3 parallaxes with respect to asteroseismic scaling relation radii from K2 data. [...] We investigated on the robustness of the results based on Kepler data. We cross-matched asteroseismic and astrometric data for over 12,000 red giant branch and red clump stars from the end-of-mission Kepler catalogue with the Gaia DR3 and TIC v8.2 to obtain precise parallaxes, V- and K-band magnitudes, and E(B - V) colour excesses. Two well-tested SBCRs from the literature were adopted to estimate stellar radii. The analysis confirmed that SBCR and asteroseismic radii agree very well. The overall differences are only 1-2% depending on the adopted SBCR. The dispersion of 7% was about two-thirds of what was found for K2-based data. As a difference from the K2-based investigation, the ratio of SBCRs-to-asteroseismic radii did not depend on the metallicity [Fe/H]. Moreover, the intriguing decreasing trend with [$\alpha$/Fe] of the radius ratio for massive stars that was observed in K2 data was absent in Kepler data. The SBCR radii are systematically higher than asteroseismic estimates by 5% for stars with masses below 1.0 $M_{\odot}$. The SBCRs have proven to be a highly effective tool for estimating radii with a precision comparable to that obtained from asteroseismology, but at a significantly lower observational cost. Moreover, the superior concordance of Kepler-derived radii with SBCR measurements and the absence of the discrepancies observed in the K2-derived radii suggest the existence of underlying systematic errors that impact specific mass and metallicity regimes within the K2 dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 Subdwarf B stars are a well-known class of hot, low-mass stars thought to be formed through interactions in stellar binary systems. While different formation channels for subdwarf B stars have been studied through a binary population synthesis approach, it has also become evident that the characteristics of the found populations depend on the initial set of assumptions that describe the sometimes poorly constrained physical processes, such as common envelope episodes or angular momentum loss during mass transfer events. In this work we present a parameter study of subdwarf B populations, including a novel analytic prescription that approximates the evolution of subdwarf B stars with hydrogen-rich outer shells, an element previously overlooked in rapid binary population synthesis. We find that all studied parameters strongly impact the properties of the population, with the possibility of igniting helium below the expected core-mass value near the tip of the red giant branch strongly affecting the total number of subdwarf B candidates. Critically, our newly proposed prescription for the evolution of subdwarf B stars with hydrogen-shells helps to reconcile theoretical predictions of surface gravity and effective temperature with observational results. Our prescription is useful in the context of rapid binary population synthesis studies and can be applied to other rapid binary population synthesis codes' output.

 - **Abstract**
 We present $\sim8-40\,\mu$m SOFIA-FORCAST images of seven regions of ``clustered" star formation as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. We identify a total of 34 protostar candidates and build their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We fit these SEDs with a grid of radiative transfer models based on the Turbulent Core Accretion (TCA) theory to derive key protostellar properties, including initial core mass, $M_c$, clump environment mass surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, and current protostellar mass, $m_*$. We also carry out empirical graybody (GB) estimation of $\Sigma_{\rm cl}$, which allows a case of restricted SED fitting within the TCA model grid. We also release version 2.0 of the open-source Python package \emph{sedcreator}, designed to automate the aperture photometry and SED building and fitting process for sources in clustered environments, where flux contamination from close neighbors typically complicates the process. Using these updated methods, SED fitting yields values of $M_c\sim30-200\:M_{\odot}$, $\Sigma_{\text{cl,SED}}\sim0.1-3\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$, and $m_*\sim4-50\:M_{\odot}$. The graybody fitting yields smaller values of $\Sigma_{\text{cl,GB}}\lesssim1\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$. From these results, we do not find evidence for a critical $\Sigma_{\rm{cl}}$ needed to form massive ($\gtrsim 8\:M_\odot$) stars. However, we do find tentative evidence for a dearth of the most massive ($m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$) protostars in the clustered regions suggesting a potential impact of environment on the stellar initial mass function.
#### ALMA detections of circumstellar disks in the giant Hii region M17. Probing the intermediate- to high-mass pre-main-sequence population

 - **Abstract**
 Our current understanding is that intermediate- to high-mass stars form in a way similar to low-mass stars, that is, through disk accretion. However, the physical conditions that play a role in disk formation, evolution, and the possibility of (sub)stellar companion formation, are significantly different. We search for the mm counterparts of four intermediate- to high-mass (4-10 Solar mass) young stellar objects (YSOs) in the giant Hii region M17 at a distance of 1.7 kpc. These objects expose their photospheric spectrum such that their location on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) is well established. They have a circumstellar disk that is likely remnant of the formation process. With ALMA we have detected, for the first time, these four YSOs in M17, in Band 6 and 7, as well as four other serendipitous objects. Besides the flux measurements, the source size and spectral index provide important constraints on the physical mechanism(s) producing the observed emission. We apply different models to estimate the dust and gas mass contained in the disks. All our detections are spatially unresolved, constraining the source size to <120 au, and have a spectral index in the range 0.5-2.7. The derived (upper limits on the) disk dust masses are on the order of a few Earth masses and estimations of the upper limits on the gas mass vary between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$ Solar mass. In two objects (B331 and B268) free-free emission indicates the presence of ionized material around the star. The four serendipitous detections are likely (low-mass) YSOs. We compare the derived disk masses of our M17 targets to those obtained for YSOs in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) and Herbig stars, as a function of stellar mass, age, luminosity, and outer disk radius. The M17 sample, though small, is both the most massive and the youngest sample, yet has the lowest mean disk mass.

 - **Abstract**
 A primary target of the \Euclid space mission is to constrain early-universe physics by searching for deviations from a primordial Gaussian random field. A significant detection of primordial non-Gaussianity would rule out the simplest models of cosmic inflation and transform our understanding of the origin of the Universe. This paper forecasts how well field-level inference of galaxy redshift surveys can constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$), within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, in the upcoming \Euclid data. We design and simulate mock data sets and perform Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses using a full-field forward modelling approach. By including the formation history of the cosmic matter field in the analysis, the method takes into account all available probes of primordial non-Gaussianity, and goes beyond statistical summary estimators of $f_{NL}$. Probes include, for example, two-point and higher-order statistics, peculiar velocity fields, and scale-dependent galaxy biases. Furthermore, the method simultaneously handles systematic survey effects, such as selection effects, survey geometries, and galaxy biases. The forecast shows that the method can reach precision levels of up to $\sigma (f_{NL}) = 2.3$ (68.3\% CI, and at the grid resolution $\Delta L = 62.5\,h^{-1}$Mpc) with \Euclid data. We also provide data products, including realistic $N$-body simulations with nonzero values of $f_{NL}$ and maps of adiabatic curvature fluctuations. The results underscore the feasibility and advantages of field-level inference to constrain $f_{NL}$ in galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach consistently captures all the information available in the large-scale structure to constrain $f_{NL}$, and resolves the degeneracy between early-universe physics and late-time gravitational effects, while mitigating the impact of systematic and observational effects.

 - **Abstract**
 New radio interferometers such as MeerKAT, SKA, ngVLA, and DSA-2000 drive advancements in software for two key reasons. First, handling the vast data from these instruments requires subdivision and multi-node processing. Second, their improved sensitivity, achieved through better engineering and larger data volumes, demands new techniques to fully exploit it. This creates a critical challenge in radio astronomy software: pipelines must be optimized to process data efficiently, but unforeseen artefacts from increased sensitivity require ongoing development of new techniques. This leads to a trade-off among (1) performance, (2) flexibility, and (3) ease-of-development. Rigid designs often miss the full scope of the problem, while temporary research code is unsuitable for production. This work introduces a framework for developing radio astronomy techniques while balancing the above trade-offs. It prioritizes flexibility and ease-of-development alongside acceptable performance by leveraging Open Source data formats and software. To manage growing data volumes, data is distributed across multiple processors and nodes for parallel processing, utilizing HPC and cloud infrastructure. We present two Python libraries, Dask-MS and Codex Africanus, which enable distributed, high-performance radio astronomy software with Dask. Dask is a lightweight parallelization and distribution framework that integrates with the PyData ecosystem, addressing the "Big Data" challenges of radio astronomy.
