 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy is magnetized, compressible and turbulent, influencing many key ISM properties, like star formation, cosmic ray transport, and metal and phase mixing. Yet, basic statistics describing compressible, magnetized turbulence remain uncertain. Utilizing grid resolutions up to $10,080^3$ cells, we simulate highly-compressible, magnetized ISM-style turbulence with a magnetic field maintained by a small-scale dynamo. We measure two coexisting kinetic energy cascades, $\mathcal{E}_{\rm kin}(k) \propto k^{-n}$, in the turbulence, separating the plasma into scales that are non-locally interacting, supersonic and weakly magnetized $(n=2.01\pm 0.03\approx 2)$ and locally interacting, subsonic and highly magnetized $(n=1.465\pm 0.002\approx 3/2)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. We show that the $3/2$ spectrum can be explained with scale-dependent kinetic energy fluxes and velocity-magnetic field alignment. On the highly magnetized modes, the magnetic energy spectrum forms a local cascade $(n=1.798\pm 0.001\approx 9/5)$, deviating from any known \textit{ab initio} theory. With a new generation of radio telescopes coming online, these results provide a means to directly test if the ISM in our Galaxy is maintained by the compressible turbulent motions from within it.
#### Optical flares due to X-ray irradiation during BeXRB major outbursts

 - **Abstract**
 Be X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) may show strong X-ray and optical variability, and can exhibit some of the brightest outbursts that break through the Eddington limit. Major X-ray outbursts are often accompanied by strong optical flares that evolve parallel to the X-ray outburst. Our goal is to provide a simple quantitative explanation for the optical flares with an application to a sample of the brightest outbursts of BeXRBs in the Magellanic clouds and the Galactic Ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124. We constructed a numerical model to study X-ray irradiation in a BeXRB system. We then conducted a parametric investigation of the model parameters and made predictions for the intensity of the optical flares based on geometric and energetic constraints. From our modeling we found that the optical emission during major outbursts is consistent with being the result of X-ray irradiation of the Be disk. For individual systems, if this method is combined with independent constraints of the geometry of the Be disk, the binary orbital plane, and the plane of the observer, it can provide estimates of the Be disk size during major outbursts. Moreover, we computed a semi-analytical relation between optical flare luminosity and X-ray luminosity that is consistent with both model predictions and observed properties of flares.
#### Magnetic Webs in Stellar Radiative Zones

 - **Abstract**
 Rotational evolution of stellar radiative zones is an old puzzle. We argue that angular momentum (AM) transport by turbulent processes induced by differential rotation is insufficient, and propose that a key role is played by ``magnetic webs." We define magnetic webs as stable magnetic configurations that enforce corotation of their coupled mass shells. Stable magnetic configurations naturally form through relaxation of helical magnetic fields deposited in parts of radiative zones. We discuss the conditions for a magnetic configuration to be sufficiently sturdy to prevent the build up of differential rotation, and conclude that these conditions are easily met in stellar interiors. Low mass stars on the red giant branch (RGB) likely have their compact cores coupled to the lower part of their extended radiative mantle by a magnetic web that was deposited by the receding zone of core convection on the main sequence. This results in moderate core rotation that is broadly consistent with asteroseismic observations, as we illustrate with a stellar evolution model with mass $1.6M_\odot$. Evolving massive stars host more complicated patterns of convective zones that may leave behind many webs, transporting AM towards the surface. Efficient web formation likely results in most massive stars dying with magnetized and slowly rotating cores.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for planets analogous to Earth in terms of mass and equilibrium temperature is currently the first step in the quest for habitable conditions outside our Solar System and, ultimately, the search for life in the universe. Future missions such as PLATO or LIFE will begin to detect and characterise these small, cold planets, dedicating significant observation time to them. The aim of this work is to predict which stars are most likely to host an Earth-like planet (ELP) to avoid blind searches, minimises detection times, and thus maximises the number of detections. Using a previous study on correlations between the presence of an ELP and the properties of its system, we trained a Random Forest to recognise and classify systems as 'hosting an ELP' or 'not hosting an ELP'. The Random Forest was trained and tested on populations of synthetic planetary systems derived from the Bern model, and then applied to real observed systems. The tests conducted on the machine learning (ML) model yield precision scores of up to 0.99, indicating that 99% of the systems identified by the model as having ELPs possess at least one. Among the few real observed systems that have been tested, 44 have been selected as having a high probability of hosting an ELP, and a quick study of the stability of these systems confirms that the presence of an Earth-like planet within them would leave them stable. The excellent results obtained from the tests conducted on the ML model demonstrate its ability to recognise the typical architectures of systems with or without ELPs within populations derived from the Bern model. If we assume that the Bern model adequately describes the architecture of real systems, then such a tool can prove indispensable in the search for Earth-like planets. A similar approach could be applied to other planetary system formation models to validate those predictions.
#### MHD simulations of the slow-rise phase of solar eruptions initiated from a sheared magnetic arcade

 - **Abstract**
 Before solar eruptions, a short-term slow-rise phase is often observed, during which the pre-eruption structure ascends at speeds much greater than the photospheric motions but much less than those of the eruption phase. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the coronal evolution driven by photospheric motions up to eruptions have been used to explain the slow-rise phase, but their bottom driving speeds are much larger than realistic photospheric values. Therefore, it remains an open question how the excessively fast bottom driving impacts the slow-rise phase. Here we modelled the slow-rise phase before eruption initiated from a continuously sheared magnetic arcade. In particular, we performed a series of experiments with the bottom driving speed unprecedentedly approaching the photospheric value of around $1$ km s$^{-1}$. The simulations confirmed that the slow-rise phase is an ideal MHD process, i.e., a manifestation of the growing expansion of the sheared arcade in the process of approaching a fully open field state. The overlying field line above the core flux has a slow-rise speed modulated by the driving speed's magnitude but is always over an order of magnitude larger than the driving speed. The core field also expands with speed much higher than the driving speed but much lower than that of the overlying field. By incrementally reducing the bottom-driving speed to realistic photospheric values, we anticipate better matches between the simulated slow-rise speeds and some observed ones.
#### H-, He-like recombination spectra -- V: On the dependence of the simulated line intensities on the number of electronic levels of the atoms

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a study of the dependence of the simulated intensities of recombination lines from hydrogen and helium atoms on the number of $n\ell$-resolved principal quantum numbers included in the calculations. We simulate hydrogen and helium emitting astrophysical plasmas using the code Cloudy and show that, if not enough $n\ell$-resolved levels are included, recombination line intensities can be predicted with significant errors than can be more than 30\% for H~I IR lines and 10\% for He~I optical lines ($\sim$20\% for He~I IR recombination lines) at densities $\sim1\text{cm}^{-3}$, comparable to interstellar medium. This can have consequences in several spectroscopic studies where high accuracy is required, such as primordial helium abundance determination. Our results indicate that the minimum number of resolved levels included in the simulated hydrogen and helium ions of our spectral emission models should be adjusted to the specific lines to be predicted, as well as to the temperature and density conditions of the simulated plasma.
#### A new look into the atmospheric composition of WASP-39 b

 - **Abstract**
 Being one of the first exoplanets observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), WASP-39 b has become an iconic target and many transit spectra recorded with different instruments (NIRISS, NIRCAM, NIRSpec G395H, NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI) are currently available, allowing in-depth studies of its atmosphere. We present here a novel approach to interpret WASP-39 b's transit spectroscopic data, consisting of a multi-step process where ab initio equilibrium chemistry models and blind retrievals are used iteratively to find physically robust, optimal solutions. Following this approach, we have identified a new scenario to explain WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, in which silicon-based chemistry plays a major role. In this scenario, SiO may explain the spectral absorption at 4.1 $\mu$m, currently interpreted as being due to SO$_2$. SiO and the other gas species identified by the retrieval models, i.e. H$_2$O, CO$_2$, Na and K, are consistent with an atmosphere in chemical equilibrium with a temperature-pressure profile constrained by H$_2$O and CO$_2$ absorption bands. In addition, silicate clouds and hazes can produce the spectral features observed by MIRI in the spectral window 5-12 $\mu$m. While we advocate the need for more data, possibly at higher spectral resolution, to confirm our results for WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, we highlight a refined atmospheric retrieval strategy with pre-selection and post-reconstruction to guide the next generation of transit spectroscopy.
#### Orbit design for mitigating interstellar scattering effects in Earth-space VLBI observations of Sgr A*

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) The black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for next-generation Earth-space very-long-baseline interferometry missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which aims to probe baselines of the order of 20 G$\lambda$. At these baselines, Sgr A* observations will be affected by the diffractive scattering effects from the interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, we study how different parameter choices for turbulence in the ISM affect BHEX's observational capabilities to probe strong lensing features of Sgr A*. By using a simple geometric model of concentric Gaussian rings for Sgr A*'s photon ring signal and observing at 320 GHz, we find that the BHEX-ALMA baseline has the required sensitivity to observe Sgr A* for a broad range of values of the power-law index of density fluctuations in the ISM and the inner scale of turbulence. For other baselines with moderate sensitivities, a strong need for observations at shorter scales of $\approx$ 13.5 G$\lambda$ is identified. For this purpose, an orbit migration scheme is proposed. It is modeled using both chemical propulsion (CP)-based Hohmann transfers and electric propulsion (EP)-based orbit raising with the result that a CP-based transfer can be performed in a matter of hours, but with a significantly higher fuel requirement as compared to EP, which however requires a transfer time of around 6 weeks. The consequences of these orbits for probing Sgr A*'s spacetime is studied by quantifying the spatial resolution, temporal resolution and the angular sampling of the photon ring signal in the Fourier coverage of each of these orbits. We show that higher orbits isolate spacetime features while sacrificing both, signal lost to scattering and temporal resolution, but gain greater access to the morphology of the photon ring.
