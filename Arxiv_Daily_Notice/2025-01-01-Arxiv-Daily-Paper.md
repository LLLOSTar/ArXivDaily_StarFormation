 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play a pivotal role in shaping their galactic surroundings due to their high luminosity and intense ionizing radiation. However, the precise mechanisms governing the formation of massive stars remain elusive. Complex organic molecules (COMs) offer an avenue for studying star formation across the low- to high-mass spectrum because COMs are found in every young stellar object phase and offer insight into the structure and temperature. We aim to unveil evolutionary patterns of COM chemistry in 41 massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) sourced from diverse catalogues, using ALMA Band 6 spectra. Previous line analysis of these sources showed the presence of CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and CH$_3$CCH with diverse excitation temperatures and column densities, indicating a possible evolutionary path across sources. However, this analysis usually involves manual line extraction and rotational diagram fitting. Here, we improve upon this process by directly retrieving the physicochemical state of MYSOs from their dimensionally-reduced spectra. We use a Locally Linear Embedding to find a lower-dimensional projection for the physicochemical parameters obtained from individual line analysis. We identify clusters of similar MYSOs in this embedded space using a Gaussian Mixture Model. We find three groups of MYSOs with distinct physicochemical conditions: i) cold, COM-poor sources, ii) warm, medium-COM-abundance sources, and iii) hot, COM-rich sources. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the spectral sample, finding further evidence for an evolutionary path across MYSO groups. Finally, we find that the physicochemical state of our sample can be derived directly from the spectra by training a simple random forest model on the first few PCA components. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in obtaining clear physical insights directly from MYSO spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 The radioactive decay of short-lived 26Al to 26Mg has been used to estimate the timescales over which 26Al was produced in a nearby star and the protosolar disk evolved. The chronology commonly assumes that 26Al was uniformly distributed in the protosolar disk; however, this assumption is challenged by the discordance between the timescales defined by the Al-Mg and assumption-free Pb-Pb chronometers. We find that the 26Al heterogeneity is correlated with the nucleosynthetic stable Ti isotope variation, which can be ascribed to the non-uniform distribution of ejecta from a core-collapse supernova in the disk. We use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to calibrate variable 26Al abundances in Al-Mg dating of early solar system processes. The calibrated Al-Mg chronometer indicates a >1 Myr gap between parent body accretion ages of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrites. We further use the Al-Ti isotope correlation to constrain the timing and location of the supernova explosion, indicating that the explosion occurred at 20-30 pc from the protosolar cloud, 0.94 +0.25/-0.21 Myr before the formation of the oldest solar system solids. Our results imply that the Sun was born in association with a ~25 solar mass star.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanoflares are believed to be key contributors to heating solar non-flaring active regions, though their individual detection remains challenging. This study uses a data-driven field-aligned hydrodynamic model to examine nanoflare properties throughout the lifecycle of AR12758. We simulate coronal loop emissions, where each loop is heated by random nanoflares depending on the loop parameters derived from photospheric magnetograms observed by SDO/HMI. Simulated X-ray flux and temperature can reproduce the temporal variations observed by Chandrayaan-2/XSM. Our findings show that high-frequency nanoflares contribute to cool emissions across the AR, while low- and intermediate- frequency primarily contribute to hot emissions. During the emerging phase, energy deposition is dominated by low-frequency events. Post-emergence, energy is deposited by both low- and intermediate-frequency nanoflares, while as the AR ages, the contribution from intermediate- and high-frequency nanoflares increases. The spatial distribution of heating frequencies across the AR reveals a clear pattern: the core of the active region spends most of its time in a low-frequency heating state, the periphery is dominated by high-frequency heating, and the region between the core and periphery experiences intermediate-frequency heating.
#### Uncovering the hidden physical structures and protostellar activities in the Low-Metallicity S284-RE region: results from ALMA and JWST

 - **Abstract**
 We present an observational study of the S284-RE region, a low-metallicity area associated with the extended S284 HII region. A thermally supercritical filament (mass $\sim$2402 $M_{\odot}$, length $\sim$8.5 pc) is investigated using the Herschel column density map. The Spitzer ratio 4.5 $\mu$m/3.6 $\mu$m map traces the H$_{2}$ outflows in this filament, where previously reported young stellar objects (YSOs) are spatially distributed. Analysis of the YSO distribution has revealed three active star-forming clusters (YCl1, YCl2, YCl3) within the filament. YCl3 seems to be the most evolved, YCl2 the youngest, while YCl1 displays signs of non-thermal fragmentation. The JWST (F470N+F444W)/F356W ratio map reveals at least seven bipolar H$_{2}$ outflows, with four (olc1--olc4) in YCl1 and three (ol1--ol3) in YCl2. The driving sources of these outflows are identified based on outflow geometry, ALMA continuum peaks, and YSO positions. Two ALMA continuum sources, #2 and #3, from the $M$-$R_{\rm eff}$ plot are recognized as potential massive star formation candidates. The ALMA continuum source #2 hosts at least three outflow-driving sources, whereas the ALMA continuum source #3 contains two. The bipolar outflow olc1, driven by an embedded object within the continuum source #2, is likely a massive protostar, as indicated by Br-$\alpha$ and PAH emissions depicted in the JWST (F405N+F444W)/F356W ratio map. The presence of H$_{2}$ knots in the outflows olc1 and ol1 suggests episodic accretion. Overall, the study investigates a massive protostar candidate, driving the $\sim$2.7 pc H$_{2}$ outflow olc1 and undergoing episodic accretion.
#### Evolution of massive black hole in galactic nucleus

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a scenario for mass evolution of massive black holes (MBH) in galactic nuclei, to explain both the mass correlation of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) with the bulge and the down-sizing behavior of the active galactic nuclei. Primordial gas structures to evolve galactic bulges are supposed to be formed at $z \sim$ 10 and the core region, called the nuclear region (NR) here, is considered to be a place for a MBH to grow to the SMBH. The down-sizing behavior requires the MBH to significantly increase the mass in a time $\sim$ 1 Gyr. The rapid mass increase is discussed to be realized only when the MBH stays in a very high density region such as a core of a molecular cloud throughout the period $\sim$ 1 Gyr. According to these arguments, the MBHs formed from the population III stars born in the mini halos at $z \sim$ 20 - 30 are excluded from the candidates for the seed black hole to the SMBH and only the MBHs from the population II stars born in the core of the central molecular cloud (CMC) in the NR remain as them. The MBHs in the dense core of the CMC started increasing the mass through mass-accretion and the most massive black hole (MMBH) got the most rapid evolution, possibly restraining relatively slow evolutions of the less massive black holes. Dynamical interactions of the MMBH with the ambient MCs induced the wandering motion and the further mass-increase. However, when the MMBH mass exceeded a boundary mass, the dynamical friction with the field stars brakes the MMBH wandering and the mass accretion. This scenario can semi-quantitatively reproduce both the down-sizing behavior and the SMBH mass - bulge mass correlation with reasonable parameter values.
#### An estimate of resident time of the Oort Cloud new comets in planetary region

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the result of our numerical orbit simulation which traces dynamical evolution of new comets coming from the Oort Cloud. We combine two dynamical models for this purpose. The first one is semi-analytic, and it models an evolving comet cloud under galactic tide and encounters with nearby stars. The second one numerically deals with planetary perturbation in the planetary this http URL our study does not include physical effects such as fading or disintegration of comets, we found that typical dynamical resident time of the comets in the planetary region is about $10^8$ years. We also found that the so-called planet barrier works when the initial orbital inclination of the comets is small. A numerical result concerning the temporary transition of the comets into other small body populations such as transneptunian objects or Centaurs is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The methoxy radical, CH$_3$O, has long been studied experimentally and theoretically by spectroscopists because it displays a weak Jahn-Teller effect in its electronic ground state, combined with a strong spin-orbit interaction. In this work, we report an extension of the measurement of the pure rotational spectrum of the radical in its vibrational ground state in the submillimeter-wave region (350$-$860 GHz). CH$_3$O was produced by H-abstraction from methanol using F-atoms, and its spectrum was probed in absorption using an association of source-frequency modulation and Zeeman modulation spectroscopy. All the observed transitions together with available literature data in $v = 0$ were combined and fit using an effective Hamiltonian allowing to reproduce the data at their experimental accuracy. The newly measured transitions involve significantly higher frequencies and rotational quantum numbers than those reported in the literature ($f < 860$ GHz and $N \leq 15$ instead of 272 GHz and 7, respectively) which results in significant improvements in the spectroscopic parameters determination. The present model is well constrained and allows a reliable calculation of the rotational spectrum of the radical over the entire microwave to submillimeter-wave domain. It can be used with confidence for future searches of CH$_3$O in the laboratory and the interstellar medium.
#### Investigating Temporal and Spatial Variation of Jupiter's Atmosphere with Radio Observations

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spatial and temporal variability in Jupiter's atmosphere by comparing longitude-resolved brightness temperature maps from the Very Large Array (VLA) radio observatory and NASA's Juno spacecraft Microwave Radiometer (MWR) taken between 2013 and 2018. Spatial variations in brightness temperature, as observed at radio wavelengths, indicate dynamics in the atmosphere as they trace spatial fluctuations in radio-absorbing trace gases or physical temperature. We use four distinct frequency bands, probing the atmosphere from the water cloud region at the lowest frequency to the pressures above the ammonia cloud deck at the highest frequency. We visualize the brightness temperature anomalies and trace dynamics by analyzing the shapes of brightness temperature anomaly distributions as a function of frequency in Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (NEB), Equatorial Zone (EZ), and South Equatorial Belt (SEB). The NEB has the greatest brightness temperature variability at all frequencies, indicating that more extreme processes are occurring there than in the SEB and EZ. In general, we find that the atmosphere at 5 and 22 GHz has the least variability of the frequencies considered, while observations at 10 and 15 GHz have the greatest variability. When comparing the size of the features corresponding to the anomalies, we find evidence for small-scale events primarily at the depths probed by the 10 and 15 GHz observations. In contrast, we find larger-scale structures deeper (5 GHz) and higher (22 GHz) in the atmosphere.
