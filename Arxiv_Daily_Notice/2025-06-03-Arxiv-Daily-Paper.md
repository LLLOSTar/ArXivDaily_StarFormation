 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs) may fuel future star formation in the Milky Way, but they must first survive their passage through the hot halo. While recent work has improved our understanding of the survival criterion for cloud-wind interactions, few observational comparisons exist that test this criterion. We therefore present an initial comparison of simulations with the Smith Cloud (SC; $d=$ 12.4 kpc, $l, b = 40^{\circ}, -13^{\circ}$) as mapped with the GALFA-HI survey. We use the Smith Cloud's observed properties to motivate simulations of comparable clouds in wind tunnel simulations with Enzo-E, an MHD code. For both observations and simulations, we generate moment maps, characterize turbulence through a projected first-order velocity structure function (VSF), and do the same for HI column density with a normalized autocovariance function. We explore how initial cloud conditions (such as radius, metallicity, thermal pressure, viewing angle, and distance) affect these statistics, demonstrating that the small-scale VSF is sensitive to cloud turbulence while large scales depend on cloud bulk velocity and viewing angle. We find that some simulations reproduce key observational features (particularly the correlation between column density and velocity dispersion) but none match all observational probes at the same time (the large scales of the column density autocovariance is particularly challenging). We find that the simulated cloud (cloud C) showing growth via a turbulent radiative mixing layer (TRML) is the best match, implying the importance of TRML-mediated cooling for Milky Way HVCs. We conclude by suggesting improvements for simulations to better match observed HVCs.
#### Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Pipeline-Determined Physical Properties of OB Stars

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to determine the physical properties of OB stars from the multi-epoch VLT/FLAMES BLOeM spectroscopic survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of OB stars to the co-added, initial 9 epochs of the BLOeM survey, utilising grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND. 69 OB stars are excluded from the analysis owing to disk emission or significant contamination by secondaries in SB2 binaries. We determine physical properties of 778 OB stars, including Teff, log g, log L/Lsun and v_e sin i. There appears to be a bimodality in v_e sin i of single O stars, while v_e sin i distributions of OB stars are strikingly different for single (median 78 km/s) and binary (median 200 km/s) systems. Inferred temperatures are broadly in agreement with literature results for stars in common, plus results from a grid-based automization tool for a subset of O and early B stars, although uncertainties are larger for surface gravities. Rotational velocities are broadly in line with an independent tool applied to the same subset. We recover the anticipated lower mass cutoff at 8 Msun from the survey design using a Bayesian inference method coupled with SMC metallicity evolutionary models, with median masses of 12.6 Msun (19.8 Msun) for B-type (O-type) stars. Spectroscopic masses exceed evolutionary masses, albeit with large uncertainties in surface gravities. We also provide an updated catalogue of O stars in the SMC since half of the 159 BLOeM O stars are newly classified as O-type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will detect millions of supernovae (SNe) and generate millions of nightly alerts, far outpacing available spectroscopic resources. Rapid, scalable photometric classification methods are therefore essential for identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale population studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification pipeline that infers supernova classes using only host galaxy photometry. SPLASH first associates SNe with their hosts (yielding a redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate using deep learning, and finally classifies SNe using a random forest trained on these inferred properties, along with host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary (Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of $76\%$ and an F1-score of $69\%$, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. By selecting only the most confident predictions, SPLASH can return highly pure subsets of all major SN types, making it well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design allows classification of $\sim 500$ SNe per second, making it ideal for next-generation surveys. Moreover, its intermediate inference step enables selection of transients by host environment, providing a tool not only for classification but also for probing the demographics of stellar death.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that most star-forming regions in our Galaxy form stellar associations rather than bound clusters. We analyse models from the STARFORGE simulation suite, a set of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that include all key stellar feedback and radiative processes following star formation through cloud dispersal. We create synthetic observations by introducing observational biases such as random spurious measurements, unresolved binaries, and photometric sensitivity. These biases affect the measurement of the group mass, size, and velocity dispersion, introducing uncertainties of up to 100%, with accuracy improving as the number of system members increases. Furthermore, models favouring the formation of groups around massive stars were the most affected by observational biases, as massive stars contribute a larger fraction of the group mass and are often missing from astrometric surveys like Gaia. We compare the simulations to the Cepheus Far North (CFN) region, and show that CFN groups may have formed in a low-density environment similar to those modelled in STARFORGE but with massive stars not located preferentially in groups. We also question the effectiveness of the kinematic traceback method, showing that it is accurate within 20% only for certain associations with actual virial parameters above 2. However, observational biases can artificially raise the virial parameter by up to a factor ten, making it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the traceback age. Additionally, since stars continue to form during the dispersal of the parent cloud, we find no relation between the stellar-dynamical age difference and the length of the embedded phase.
#### Hydrodynamical modelling of Type IIb SNe

 - **Abstract**
 We present HYDE, a new one-dimensional hydrodynamical code, and use it to construct a grid of supernova (SN) models based on solar-metallicity bare helium-core models evolved to the verge of core-collapse with MESA STAR. This grid is suited to model Type IIb SNe, which progenitor stars are thought to have lost all but a tiny fraction of their hydrogen envelopes. Using an automated procedure we fit the bolometric lightcurves and photospheric velocities for a large sample of (17) Type IIb SNe to the grid of SN models. We find that the distribution of initial masses for the sample can be reasonably well described by a standard Salpeter IMF, although there is an under-population in the >25 M$_\odot$ range. The fractions of SNe with initial masses <15 M$_\odot$ and <20 M$_\odot$ are 56 and 81 percent, respectively, suggesting either the binary channel to dominate the production of Type IIb SNe or a flaw in our understanding of single-star mass-loss. We find correlations between the explosion energy, initial mass and mass of $^{56}$Ni; the explosion energy increases with initial mass and the mass of $^{56}$Ni increases with explosion energy. The method used allows us to determine the errors in the model parameters arising from the observed quantities and the degeneracy of the solution. We find that an error in the distance and extinction propagates mainly to the derived mass of $^{56}$Ni, whereas an error in the photospheric velocity propagates mainly to the derived helium-core mass and explosion energy. Fits using the bolometric lightcurve alone are completely degenerate along the M$_{\mathrm{ej}}^{2}$/E$_{\mathrm{ej}}$=const curve, whereas fits using also the photospheric velocities are quite robust for well-sampled SNe. Finally, we provide a description and tests of the HYDE code, and a discussion of the limitations of the method used.
#### Correlations between Event Rates of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts and Star Formation Rates with/without Time Delay

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we systematically investigate the redshift and luminosity distributions as well as the event rates of short Gamma-Ray Bursts (SGRBs) detected by Swift, Fermi, Konus-wind satellites. It is found that the distributions of redshift and luminosity of Fermi and Konus-wind SGRBs are identical and they obviously differ from those of Swift/BAT SGRBs. The luminosity distributions of SGRBs detected by diverse detectors can be uniformly fitted by a smoothly broken power-law function. The median luminosity of Swift SGRBs is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of Fermi/GBM or Konus-wind SGRBs. We also compare the local event rates of Swift/BAT, Fermi/GBM and Konus-wind SGRBs and find that the local rate of Swift SGRBs is around two orders of magnitude larger than that of either Fermi or Konus-wind SGRBs, while the latter two rates are comparable. The observed SGRB rates can be successfully fitted by a power-law plus Gauss function. The SGRB rates of three kinds of detectors matches the delayed/undelayed SFRs well except the delayed Lognormal and/or Gaussian SFRs at higher redshift and exceed all types of SFRs at lower redshift of $z<1$. After deducting the diverse SFR components from the SGRB rates, we surprisingly notice that the remaining SGRB rates steeply decline with redshift in a power-law-like form, indicating that these SGRBs could emerge from the old star populations or compact binary star mergers.
#### Shaping core dynamos in A-type stars: The role of dipolar fossil fields

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale magnetic fields of Ap/Bp stars are stable over long timescales and have typically simple dipolar geometries, leading to the idea of a fossil origin. These stars are also expected to have convective cores that can host strong dynamo action. We aim to study the interaction between the magnetic fields generated by the convective core dynamo of the star, and a dipolar fossil field reminiscent of observed magnetic topologies of Ap/Bp stars. We use numerical 3D star-in-a-box simulations of a $2.2M_\odot$ A-type star, where the core encompasses $20\%$ of the stellar radius. As an initial condition, we impose two purely poloidal configurations, both with a surface dipolar strength of 6 kG, and we explore different obliquity angles $\beta$ (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes), ranging from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. The inclusion of a poloidal field where none of the magnetic field lines are closed inside the star, does not affect the core dynamo in a significant way. Dipolar configurations where all the field lines are closed inside the star can enhance the dynamo, producing a superequipartition quasi-stationary solution, where the magnetic energy is 5 times stronger than the kinetic energy. The enhanced core dynamos have typical magnetic field strengths between 105 and 172 kG, where the strength has an inverse relation with $\beta$. The strong magnetic fields produce an almost rigid rotation in the radiative envelope, and change the differential rotation of the core from solar-like to anti-solar. The only cases where the imposed dipoles are unstable and decay are those with $\beta = 90^\circ$. In the rest of cases, the core dynamos are enhanced and the surface magnetic field survives keeping simple topologies like in the observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper describes a Space-VLBI observation of the 22 GHz H2O masers in the massive star-forming region G25.65+1.05, using the 10-m space antenna of Radioastron together with the ground-based VLBA array. Two observing epochs at the pre-flare and post-flare state of the maser source are presented. Leveraging the exceptional angular resolution provided by space-ground baselines along with the broad UV coverage from VLBA baselines, we gained a detailed perspective on the area associated with the maser flare events.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) WASP-178b accounting for NLTE effects and compare synthetic transmission spectra with NUV and optical observations. We use the HELIOS code (LTE) in the lower and the Cloudy code (LTE or NLTE) in the middle and upper atmosphere to compute the temperature-pressure (TP) and abundance profiles. We further use Cloudy to compute the theoretical planetary transmission spectrum both in LTE and NLTE for comparison with observations. We find an isothermal TP profile at pressures higher than 10 mbar and lower than 10$^{-8}$ bar, with an almost linear increase from about 2200 K to about 8100 K in between. The temperature structure is driven by NLTE effects, particularly in the form of increased heating resulting from the overpopulation of long-lived FeII levels with strong transitions in the NUV band, where the stellar emission is strong, and of decreased cooling due to the underpopulation of MgI and MgII levels that dominate the cooling. The planetary atmosphere is hydrostatic up to pressures of about 1 nbar, and thus accurately modelling spectral lines forming at pressures lower than about 1 nbar requires accounting for both hydrodynamics and NLTE effects. The NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum overestimates the observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ absorption, while the LTE model is in good agreement, which is surprising as the opposite has been found for the other UHJs for which NLTE modelling has been performed. Instead, in the NUV we find an excellent match between the NLTE transmission spectrum and the HST/UVIS data, contrary to the LTE model. This contrasts previous LTE results requiring SiO absorption to fit the observations. The accurate characterisation of the atmosphere of UHJs is possible only accounting for NLTE effects, and particularly for the level population of Fe and Mg, which dominate heating and cooling, respectively.
#### Testing the Young FRB Progenitor Hypothesis: A Crossmatch of Catalog-1 CHIME Bursts with Historic Local Universe Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most energetic and enigmatic transients in the radio sky, with mounting evidence suggesting newborn, highly magnetized neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) as their sources. A definitive spatial association between an FRB and a historic CCSN would confirm this link and tightly constrain young neutron star source models. Here we report on the first systematic cross-matching of 886 spectroscopically classified CCSNe in the local Universe (z $\leq$ 0.043) against 241 CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 events, applying rigorous spatial, dispersion measure (DM), and scattering time (${\tau}$) criteria. We identify four positional overlaps, all consistent with chance alignment; however, one pair, FRB 20190412B-SN 2009gi, also satisfies independent host-DM and ${\tau}$ constraints, making it a promising candidate for targeted follow-up. Next, we search for compact (persistent or transient) radio emission at all matched supernova sites using multi-epoch VLASS data and detect none. Treating every CCSN sight line as a non-detection, we derive Poisson upper limits on the FRB burst rate at these locations, which lie well below the rates observed for the most active repeaters unless their activity is heavily suppressed by beaming, intermittency, or residual free-free absorption. We then develop a galaxy-integrated FRB-rate model that incorporates an intrinsic spectral index, secular magnetar-activity decay, and frequency-dependent free-free opacity. Applying this formalism to existing FRB data shows that reproducing the observed CHIME/CRAFT all-sky rate ratio requires a steep decline in magnetar burst rates with age. Finally, our work underscores the necessity of sub-arcsecond localizations and multiwavelength follow-up to definitively test the young neutron star source hypothesis.
#### Dense clumps survive in the vicinity of R136 in 30 Doradus

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC. Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun, and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas. Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers ($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is all but empty. To date, more than 300 molecules have already been discovered. Because of the extremely low temperature, the gas-phase chemistry is dominated by barrierless exothermic reactions of radicals and ions. However, several abundant molecules and organic molecules cannot be produced efficiently by gas-phase reactions. To explain the existence of such molecules in the ISM, gas-surface interactions between small molecules and dust particles covered with amorphous solid water (ASW) mantles must be considered. In general, surface processes such as adsorption, diffusion, desorption, and chemical reactions can be linked to the binding energy of molecules to the surface. Hence, a lot of studies have been performed to identify the binding energies of interstellar molecules on ASW surfaces. Cosmic radiation and free electrons may induce a negative charge on the dust particles, and the binding energies may be affected by this charge. In this study, we calculate the binding energies of CO, CH4, and NH3, on neutral and charged ASW surfaces using DFT calculations. Our results indicate that CO can interact with the surface charge, increasing its binding energy. In contrast, the binding energy of CH4 remains unchanged in the presence of surface charge, and that of NH3 typically decreases.

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar linear polarization occurs when starlight passes through elongated dust grains aligned by interstellar magnetic fields. The observed polarization can come from different dust structures along the line of sight (LOS). By combining polarization measurements with stellar distances, we can study the plane-of-sky Galactic magnetic field (GMF) between the observer and the star and separate the contributions of clouds with different GMF properties. We used optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarization data from three regions in the Galactic plane ($|b|<1^{\circ}$ and $19.\!\!^{\circ}8<l<25.\!\!^{\circ}5$) to perform a polarization decomposition across the Galactic arms. A comparison between optical and NIR data showed an optical-to-NIR polarization ratio of 2 to 3 along the LOS and a consistent polarization angle across both wavelengths in all studied regions, within measurement uncertainties. We applied the Bayesian Inference of Starlight Polarization in one dimension and the Gaussian Mixture Model methods to decompose the polarization in the three regions. Optical and NIR observations complemented each other, consistently identifying nearby ($d\lesssim143$ pc), intermediate ($0.47$ kpc $< d < 1.2$ kpc), and distant ($1.5$ kpc $< d < 2.5$ kpc) polarizing clouds, in agreement with previous findings in the Local Bubble wall, the Local arm, and the Sagittarius arm dust structures. The results from both polarization decomposition methods agree and complement each other. Polarization tomography revealed significant LOS variations in the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation in two of the three regions. The relative alignment between the magnetic fields traced by starlight polarization and Planck's polarized thermal dust emission at 353 GHz reaffirmed these variations.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismic binaries are two oscillating stars detected in a single light curve. These systems provide robust constraints on stellar models from the combination of dynamical and asteroseismical stellar parameters. Predictions suggested that approximately 200 asteroseismic binaries may exist among the Kepler long-cadence data, and the majority of them consist of two red-clump stars. However, detecting these systems is challenging when the binary components exhibit oscillations at similar frequencies that are indistinguishable. In this study, we predict the morphologies of power density spectra (PDS) of seismically unresolved red-giant asteroseismic binaries to provide examples that can be used to identify among observed stars. We created 5,000 artificial asteroseismic binary (AAB) systems by combining the KASOC light curves of red giants with oscillations at similar frequency ranges. To quantify the complexity of the oscillation patterns, we used the maximum signal-to-noise ratio of the background-normalized PDS and Shannon entropy. Additionally, we identified the radial and quadrupole mode pairs for the individual binary components and determined their impact on the PDS morphologies of AABs. Our results reveal that the majority of AABs consist of the two red-clump stars. The PDS of AABs generally exhibits increased entropy and decreased oscillation power compared to individual components. We focused on the AABs whose stellar components have similar brightness and classified them into four distinct morphologies: single star-like PDS, aligned, partially aligned, and misaligned. Most AABs with detectable oscillations from both components show complex oscillation patterns. Therefore, unresolved asteroseismic binaries with low oscillation power and complex oscillation patterns as characterized by high entropy offer a potential explanation to understand the observed stars with complex PDS.
#### Critical Metallicity of Cool Supergiant Formation. II. Physical Origin

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity ($Z_{\rm c}\sim 0.001$) required for the formation of cool supergiants, as revealed by stellar evolution models. Using model grids that vary in mass, metallicity, opacity, and nuclear reaction rates, we identify a threshold terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius ($R_{\rm T}$) that determines whether a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Through stellar models and homology relations, we show that metallicity affects the TAMS radius via its influence on opacity and nuclear energy generation. By classifying the evolutionary pathways of supergiants, we demonstrate how TAMS radius, shaped by metallicity, decisively governs the post-main-sequence outcome: Stars with metallicities $Z < Z_{\rm c}$ exhibit TAMS radii smaller than $R_{\rm T}$ and proceed to advanced core helium or carbon burning while retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing further expansion into the RSG regime. In contrast, stars with $Z > Z_{\rm c}$ have TAMS radii larger than $R_{\rm T}$ and expand into the stable RSG phase during core helium burning. The envelope radius at the onset of core helium burning is the key factor determining whether a star becomes a red or blue supergiant. Our results explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.
