#### Detecting dark objects with plasma microlensing by their gravitational wakes

 - **Abstract**
 A moving mass makes a gravitational wake in the partially ionized interstellar medium, which acts as a lens for radio-frequency light. Consequently, plasma microlensing could complement gravitational microlensing in the search for invisible massive objects, such as stellar remnants or compact dark matter. This work explores the spatial structure of the plasma lens associated with a gravitational wake. Far away from the moving mass, the characteristic lensing signal is the steady demagnification or magnification of a radio source as the wake passes in front of it at the speed of sound. Sources can be plasma lensed at a much greater angular distance than they would be gravitationally lensed to the same degree by the same object. However, only the wakes of objects greatly exceeding stellar mass are expected to dominate over the random turbulence in the interstellar medium.
#### Forming planetary systems that contain only minor planets

 - **Abstract**
 Estimates of the frequency of planetary systems in the Milky Way are observationally limited by the low-mass planet regime. Nevertheless, substantial evidence for systems with undetectably low planetary masses now exist in the form of main-sequence stars which host debris discs, as well as metal-polluted white dwarfs. Further, low-mass sections of star formation regions impose upper bounds on protoplanetary disc masses, limiting the capacity for terrestrial or larger planets to form. Here, we use planetary population synthesis calculations to investigate the conditions that allow planetary systems to form only minor planets and smaller detritus. We simulate the accretional, collisional and migratory growth of $10^{17}$ kg embryonic seeds and then quantify which configurations with *entirely* sub-Earth-mass bodies ($\lesssim 10^{24}$ kg) survive. We find that substantial regions of the initial parameter space allow for sub-terrestrial configurations to form, with the success rate most closely tied to the initial dust mass. Total dust mass budgets of up to $10^2 M_{\oplus}$ within 10 au can be insufficiently high to form terrestrial or giant planets, resulting in systems with only minor planets. Consequently, the prevalence of planetary systems throughout the Milky Way might be higher than what is typically assumed, and minor planet-only systems may help inform the currently uncertain correspondence between planet-hosting white dwarfs and metal-polluted white dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of young planets (< 300 Myr) is pivotal for understanding planet formation and evolution. We present the 3-5$\mu$m transmission spectrum of the 17 Myr, Jupiter-size ($R$ $\sim$10$R_{\oplus}$) planet, HIP 67522 b, observed with JWST/NIRSpec/G395H. To check for spot contamination, we obtain a simultaneous $g$-band transit with SOAR. The spectrum exhibits absorption features 30-50% deeper than the overall depth, far larger than expected from an equivalent mature planet, and suggests that HIP 67522 b's mass is $<$20 $M_{\oplus}$ irrespective of cloud cover and stellar contamination. A Bayesian retrieval analysis returns a mass constraint of $13.8\pm1.0M_{\oplus}$. This challenges the previous classification of HIP 67522 b as a hot Jupiter and instead, positions it as a precursor to the more common sub-Neptunes. With a density of $<$0.10g/cm$^{3}$, HIP 67522 b is one of the lowest density planets known. We find strong absorption from H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ ($\ge7\sigma$), a modest detection of CO (3.5$\sigma$), and weak detections of H$_2$S and SO$_2$ ($\simeq2\sigma$). Comparisons with radiative-convective equilibrium models suggest supersolar atmospheric metallicities and solar-to-subsolar C/O ratios, with photochemistry further constraining the inferred atmospheric metallicity to 3$\times$10 Solar due to the amplitude of the SO$_2$ feature. These results point to the formation of HIP 67522 b beyond the water snowline, where its envelope was polluted by icy pebbles and planetesimals. The planet is likely experiencing substantial mass loss (0.01-0.03 M$_{\oplus}$ Myr$^{-1}$), sufficient for envelope destruction within a Gyr. This highlights the dramatic evolution occurring within the first 100 Myr of its existence.

 - **Abstract**
 New, deep HST photometry allowed us to identify and study eight compact and bright (M_V< -5.8) star clusters in the outskirts of the star-forming isolated dwarf galaxy NGC5238 (M_*= 10^8 M_sun). Five of these clusters are new discoveries, and six appear projected onto, and/or aligned with the tidal tails recently discovered around this galaxy. The clusters are partially resolved into stars and their colour magnitude diagrams reveal a well developed red giant branch, implying ages older than 1-2~Gyr. Their integrated luminosity and structural parameters are typical of classical globular clusters and one of them has M_V=-10.56 +/- 0.07, as bright as Omega Cen, the brightest globular cluster of the Milky Way. Since the properties of this cluster are in the range spanned by those of nuclear star clusters we suggest that it may be the nuclear remnant of the disrupted satellite of NGC5238 that produced the observed tidal tails.
#### Q-band Line Survey Observations toward a Carbon-chain-rich Clump in the Serpens South Region

 - **Abstract**
 We have conducted Q-band (30 GHz $-$ 50 GHz) line survey observations toward a carbon-chain emission peak in the Serpens South cluster-forming region with the extended Q-band (eQ) receiver installed on the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. Approximately 180 lines have been detected including tentative detection, and these lines are attributed to 52 molecules including isotopologues. It has been found that this position is rich in carbon-chain species as much as Cyanopolyyne Peak in Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1 CP), suggesting chemical youth. Not only carbon-chain species, but several complex organic molecules (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, HCCCHO, CH$_3$CN, and tentatively C$_2$H$_3$CN) have also been detected, which is similar to the chemical complexity found in evolved prestellar cores. The HDCS/H$_2$CS ratio has been derived to be $11.3 \pm 0.5$ %, and this value is similar to the prestellar core L1544. The chemically young features that are similar to the less-dense starless core TMC-1 CP ($10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ $-$ $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) and chemically evolved characters which resemble the dense prestellar core L1544 ($\sim 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) mean that the clump including the observed position is a pre-cluster clump without any current star formation activity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam and NIRSpec investigation into the young massive star cluster (YMC) population of NGC 3256, the most cluster-rich luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) in the Great Observatories All Sky LIRG Survey. We detect 3061 compact YMC candidates with a $S/N \geq 3$ at F150W, F200W, and F335M. Based on yggdrasil stellar population models, we identify 116/3061 sources with F150W - F200W $> 0.47$ and F200W - F355M $> -1.37$ colors suggesting they are young (t $\leq 5$ Myr), dusty ($A_{V} = 5 - 15$), and massive ($M_{\odot} > 10^{5}$). This increases the sample of dust-enshrouded YMCs detected in this system by an order of magnitude relative to previous HST studies. With NIRSpec IFU pointings centered on the northern and southern nucleus, we extract the Pa$\alpha$ and 3.3$\mu$m PAH equivalent widths for 8 bright and isolated YMCs. Variations in both the F200W - F335M color and 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission with the Pa$\alpha$ line strength suggest a rapid dust clearing ($< 3 - 4$ Myr) for the emerging YMCs in the nuclei of NGC 3256. Finally, with both the age and dust emission accurately measured we use yggdrasil to derive the color excess (E(B - V)) for all 8 YMCs. We demonstrate that YMCs with strong 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission (F200W - F335M $> 0$) correspond to sources with E(B - V) $> 3$, which are typically missed in UV-optical studies. This underscores the importance of deep near-infrared imaging for finding and characterizing these very young and dust-embedded sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Sensitive radio continuum data could remove the difference between the number of known supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy compared to that expected, but due to confusion in the Galactic plane, faint SNRs can be challenging to distinguish from brighter HII regions and filamentary radio emission. Aims. We wish to exploit new SARAO MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) radio continuum data, which covers $251°\le l \le 358°$ and $2°\le l \le 61°$ at $|b|\le 1.5°$, to search for SNR candidates in the Milky Way disk. Methods. We also use MIR data from the Spitzer GLIMPSE, Spitzer MIPSGAL, and WISE surveys to help identify SNR candidates. The identified SNR candidate are sources of extended radio continuum emission that lack MIR counterparts, are not known as HII regions in the WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions, and are not known previously as SNRs Results. We locate 237 new Galactic SNR candidates in the SMGPS data. We also identify and confirm the expected radio morphology for 201 objects listed in the literature as being SNRs and 130 previously-identified SNR candidates. The known and candidate SNRs have similar spatial distributions and angular sizes. Conclusions. The SMGPS data allowed us to identify a large population of SNR candidates that can be confirmed as true SNRs using radio polarization measurements or by deriving radio spectral indices. If the 237 candidates are confirmed as true SNRs, it would approximately double the number of known Galactic SNRs in the survey area, alleviating much of the difference between the known and expected populations.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution spectroscopic characterization of young super-Jovian planets enables precise constraints on elemental and isotopic abundances of their atmospheres. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we present high-resolution spectral observations of two wide-orbit super-Jupiters in YSES 1 (or TYC 8998-760-1) using the upgraded VLT/CRIRES+ (R~100,000) in K-band. We carry out free atmospheric retrieval analyses to constrain chemical and isotopic abundances, temperature structures, rotation velocities, and radial velocities. We confirm the previous detection of 13CO in YSES 1 b at a higher significance of 12.6{\sigma}, but point to a higher 12CO/13CO ratio of 88+/-13 (1{\sigma} confidence interval), consistent with the primary's isotope ratio 66+/-5. We retrieve a solar-like composition in YSES 1 b with a C/O=0.57+/-0.01, indicating a formation via gravitational instability or core accretion beyond the CO iceline. Additionally, the observations lead to detections of H2O and CO in the outer planet YSES 1 c at 7.3{\sigma} and 5.7{\sigma}, respectively. We constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio of YSES 1 c to be either solar or subsolar (C/O=0.36+/-0.15), indicating the accretion of oxygen-rich solids. The two companions have distinct vsini, 5.34+/-0.14 km/s for YSES 1 b and 11.3+/-2.1 km/s for YSES 1 c, despite their similar natal environments. This may indicate different spin axis inclinations or effective magnetic braking by the long-lived circumplanetary disk around YSES 1 b. YSES 1 represents an intriguing system for comparative studies of super-Jovian companions and linking present atmospheres to formation histories.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origins of massive black hole seeds and their co-evolution with their host galaxy requires studying intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and estimating their mass. However, measuring the mass of these IMBHs is challenging due to the high spatial resolution requirement. A spectrophotometric reverberation monitoring is performed for a low-luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4395 to measure the size of the broad line region (BLR) and black hole mass. The data were collected using the 1.3-m Devasthal fast optical telescope (DFOT) and 3.6-m Devasthal optical telescope (DOT) at ARIES, Nainital, over two consecutive days in March 2022. The analysis revealed strong emission lines in the spectra and light curves of merged 5100Å spectroscopic continuum flux ($f_{\mathrm{5100}}$) with photometric continuum V-band and H$\alpha$, with fractional variabilities of 6.38\% and 6.31\% respectively. In comparison to several previous studies with lag estimation $<$ 90 minutes, our calculated H$\alpha$ lag supersedes by $125.0^{+6.2}_{-6.1}$ minutes using ICCF and {\small JAVELIN} methods. The velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\mathrm{line}}$) of the broad line clouds is measured to be $544.7^{+22.4}_{-25.1}$ km s$^{-1}$, yielding a black hole mass of $\sim$ $2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\times 10^{4}M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ and an Eddington ratio of 0.06.
#### SOFIA/upGREAT far-infrared spectroscopy of bright rimmed pillars in IC 1848

 - **Abstract**
 Using the upGREAT instrument on SOFIA, we have imaged the [C II] 158 {\mu}m fine structure line emission in bright-rimmed pillars located at the southern edge of the IC1848 H II region, and carried out pointed observations of the [O I] 63 and 145 {\mu}m fine structure lines toward selected positions. The observations are used to characterize the morphology, velocity field, and the physical conditions in the G1 - G3 filaments. The velocity-resolved [C II] spectra show evidence of a velocity shift at the head of the brightest G1 filament, possibly caused by radiation pressure from the impinging UV photons or the rocket effect of the evaporating gas. Archival Herschel PACS and SPIRE data imply H2 column densities in the range 10^{21} - 10^{22} cm^{-2}, corresponding to maximum visual extinction AV = 10 mag, and average H2 volume density of about 4500 cm^{-3} in the filaments. The [C II] emission traces ~ 17% of the total H2 column density, as derived from dust SED fits. PDR models are unable to explain the observed line intensities of the two [O I] fine structure lines in IC1848, with the observed [O I] 145 {\mu}m line being too strong compared to the model predictions. The [O I] lines in IC1848 are overall weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is limited. However, our observations suggest that the [O I] 63/145 {\mu}m intensity ratio is a sensitive probe of the physical conditions in photon dominated regions such as IC1848. These lines are thus excellent targets for future high-altitude balloon instruments, less affected by telluric absorption.
#### Effects of the internal temperature on vertical mixing and on cloud structures in Ultra Hot Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 The vertical mixing in hot Jupiter atmospheres plays a critical role in the formation and spacial distribution of cloud particles in their atmospheres. This affects the observed spectra of a planet through cloud opacity, which can be influenced by the degree of cold trapping of refractory species in the deep atmosphere. We aim to isolate the effects of the internal temperature on the mixing efficiency in the atmospheres of Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJ) and the spacial distribution of cloud particles across the globe. We couple a simplified tracer based cloud model, picket fence radiative-transfer scheme and mixing length theory to the Exo-FMS general circulation model. We run the model for five different internal temperatures at typical UHJ atmosphere system parameters. Our results show the convective eddy diffusion coefficient remains low throughout the vast majority of the atmosphere, with mixing dominated by advective flows. However, some regions can show convective mixing in the upper atmosphere for colder interior temperatures. The vertical extent of the clouds is reduced as the internal temperature is increased. Additionally, a global cloud layer gets formed below the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) in the cooler cases. Convection is generally strongly inhibited in UHJ atmospheres above the RCB due to their strong irradiation. Convective mixing plays a minor role compared to advective mixing in keeping cloud particles aloft in ultra hot Jupiters with warm interiors. Higher vertical turbulent heat fluxes and the advection of potential temperature inhibit convection in warmer interiors. Our results suggest isolated upper atmosphere regions above cold interiors may exhibit strong convective mixing in isolated regions around Rossby gyres, allowing aerosols to be better retained in these areas.
