#### Spatially correlated stellar accretion in the Lupus star forming region: Evidence for ongoing infall from the interstellar medium?

 - **Abstract**
 Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material is a potential way to further test this finding.

 - **Abstract**
 The carbon isotope ratio is a powerful tool for studying the evolution of stellar systems. Recent detections of CO isotopologues in disks and exoplanet atmospheres pointed towards significant fractionation in these systems. In order to understand the evolution of this quantity, it is crucial to trace the isotope abundance from stellar nurseries to planetary systems. During the protostellar stage the multiple vibrational modes of CO$_2$ and CO ice provide a unique opportunity to examine the carbon isotope ratio in the solid state. Now with the sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}, these absorption features have become accessible at high S/N in Solar-mass systems. We quantify the $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ and the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotope ratios in 17 class 0/I low mass protostars from the $^{12}$CO$_2$ combination modes (2.70 ${\mu}$m and 2.77 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO$_2$ stretching mode (4.27 ${\mu}$m), the $^{13}$CO$_2$ stretching mode (4.39 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO$_2$ bending mode (15.2 ${\mu}$m), the $^{12}$CO stretching mode (4.67 ${\mu}$m) and the $^{13}$CO stretching mode (4.78 ${\mu}$m) using JWST observations. We also report a detection of the $^{12}$CO overtone mode at 2.35 ${\mu}$m. The $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ ratios are in agreement and we find mean ratios of 85 $\pm$ 23, 76 $\pm$ 12 and 97 $\pm$ 17 for the 2.70 ${\mu}$m, 4.27 ${\mu}$m and the 15.2 ${\mu}$m bands, respectively. The main source of uncertainty stem from the error on the band strengths. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratios derived from the 4.67 ${\mu}$m bands are consistent, albeit elevated with respect to the $^{12}$CO$_2$/$^{13}$CO$_2$ ratios and we find a mean ratio of 165 $\pm$ 52. These findings indicate that ices leave the pre-stellar stage with elevated carbon isotope ratios relative to the interstellar medium and that fractionation becomes significant during the later stages.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC) form the closest interacting galactic system to the Milky Way, therewith providing a laboratory to test cosmological models in the local Universe. We quantify the likelihood for the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to be observed within the $\Lambda$CDM model using hydrodynamical simulations of the IllustrisTNG project. The orbits of the MCs are constrained by proper motion measurements taken by the $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ and $Gaia$. The MCs have a mutual separation of $d_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~24.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and a relative velocity of $v_{\mathrm{MCs}}~=~90.8\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, implying a phase-space density of $f_{\mathrm{MCs,obs}}~\equiv~(d_{\mathrm{MCs}} \cdot v_{\mathrm{MCs}})^{-3}~=~9.10\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{km^{-3}\,s^{3}\,kpc^{-3}}$. We select analogues to the MCs based on their stellar masses and distances in MW-like halos. None of the selected LMC analogues have a higher total mass and lower Galactocentric distance than the LMC, resulting in $>3.75\sigma$ tension. We also find that the $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ distribution in the highest resolution TNG50 simulation is in $3.95\sigma$ tension with observations. Thus, a hierarchical clustering of two massive satellites like the MCs in a narrow phase-space volume is unlikely in $\Lambda$CDM, presumably because of short merger timescales due to dynamical friction between the overlapping dark matter halos. We show that group infall led by an LMC analogue cannot populate the Galactic disc of satellites (DoS), implying that the DoS and the MCs formed in physically unrelated ways in $\Lambda$CDM. Since the $20^\circ$ alignment of the LMC and DoS orbital poles has a likelihood of $P=0.030$ ($2.17\sigma$), adding this $\chi^2$ to that of $f_{\mathrm{MCs}}$ gives a combined likelihood of $P = 3.90\times10^{-5}$ ($4.11\sigma$).
#### Eruptive mass-loss less than a year before the explosion of superluminous supernovae: I. The cases of SN 2020xga and SN 2022xgc

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17296

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN2020xga and SN2022xgc, two hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) at $z = 0.4296$ and $z = 0.3103$ respectively, that show an additional set of broad Mg II absorption lines, blueshifted by a few thousand km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxy absorption system. Previous work interpreted this as due to resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding CSM expelled shortly before the explosion. The peak rest-frame $g$-band magnitude of SN2020xga is $-22.30 \pm 0.04$ mag and of SN2022xgc is $-21.97 \pm 0.05$ mag, placing them among the brightest SLSNe-I. We use high-quality spectra from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths to model the Mg II line profiles and infer the properties of the CSM shells. We find that the CSM shell of SN2020xga resides at $\sim 1.3 \times 10^{16} \rm cm$ moving with a maximum velocity of $4275~\rm km~s^{-1}$, and the shell of SN2022xgc is located at $\sim 0.8 \times 10^{16} \rm cm$ reaching up to $4400~\rm km~s^{-1}$. These shells were expelled $\sim 11$ and $\sim 5$ months before explosion for SN2020xga and SN2022xgc respectively, possibly as a result of Luminous Blue Variable-like eruptions or pulsational pair instability (PPI) mass loss. We also analyze optical photometric data and model the light curves considering powering from the magnetar spin-down mechanism. The results support very energetic magnetars, approaching the mass-shedding limit, powering these SNe with ejecta masses of $\sim 7-9 \rm~M_\odot$. The ejecta masses inferred from the magnetar modeling are not consistent with the PPI scenario pointing towards stars $> 50~\rm M_\odot$ He-core, hence alternative scenarios such as fallback accretion are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Some accreting binary systems containing a white dwarf (such as classical novae or persistent supersoft sources) are seen to emit low energy X-rays with temperatures of ~10^6 K and luminosities exceeding 10^35 erg/s. These X-rays are thought to originate from nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface, either caused by a thermonuclear runaway (classical novae) or a high mass accretion rate that sustains steady nuclear burning (persistent sources). The discovery of transient supersoft X-rays from ASASSN-16oh challenged these ideas, as no signatures of nuclear fusion were detected, and the origin of these X-rays remains controversial. It was unclear whether this star was one of a kind or representative of a larger, as yet undiscovered, group. Here we present the discovery of 29 stars located in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds exhibiting long-duration, symmetrical optical outbursts similar to that seen in ASASSN-16oh. We observed one of these objects during an optical outburst and found it to be emitting transient supersoft X-rays, while no signatures of mass ejection (indicative of a classical nova eruption) were detected. We therefore propose that these objects form a homogeneous group of transient supersoft X-ray sources, which we dub `millinovae' because their optical luminosities are approximately a thousand times fainter than those of ordinary classical novae.

 - **Abstract**
 Using photometry and proper motions from Pan-STARRS, DECaLS, and Gaia DR3, we detect a ~35 to 70 degree-long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the globular cluster NGC 288. We also detect a broad, ~40 to 80 degree-long leading tail that appears to be composed of at least two narrower, spatially offset, and kinematically distinct streams. Stream modeling predicts a very similar broad composite of streams and suggests that these narrower components are each made up of one or more generations of tidal tails, each formed during different orbits over the past few gigayears. The trajectory of the trailing tail is not well matched by a model stream evolved in a static Galactic potential, but is reasonably well matched by a stream modeled in a potential that incorporates a massive, infalling Large Magellanic Cloud. Tables of the most highly ranked stream star candidates are provided for ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Earths are highly irradiated, small planets with bulk densities approximately consistent with Earth. We construct combined interior-atmosphere models of super-Earths that trace the partitioning of water throughout a planet, including an iron-rich core, silicate-rich mantle, and steam atmosphere. We compare these models with exoplanet observations to infer a $1\sigma$ upper limit on total water mass fraction of $\lesssim 3\%$ at the population level. We consider end-member scenarios that may change this value, including the efficiency of mantle outgassing and escape of high mean-molecular weight atmospheres. Although our constraints are agnostic as to the origin of water, we show that our upper limits are consistent with its production via chemical reactions of primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with magma oceans. This mechanism has also been hypothesised to explain Earth's water content, possibly pointing to a unified channel for the origins of water on small terrestrial planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally strongly lensed quasars (SL-QSO) offer invaluable insights into cosmological and astrophysical phenomena. With the data from ongoing and next-generation surveys, thousands of SL-QSO systems can be discovered expectedly, leading to unprecedented opportunities. However, the challenge lies in identifying SL-QSO from enormous datasets with high recall and purity in an automated and efficient manner. Hence, we developed a program based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for finding SL-QSO from large-scale surveys and applied it to the Kilo-degree Survey Data Release 5 (KiDS DR5). Our approach involves three key stages: firstly, we pre-selected ten million bright objects (with $r$-band $\tt{MAG\_AUTO} < 22$), excluding stars from the dataset; secondly, we established realistic training and test sets to train and fine-tune the CNN, resulting in the identification of 4195 machine candidates, and the false positive rate (FPR) of $\sim$1/2000 and recall of 0.8125 evaluated by using the real test set containing 16 confirmed lensed quasars; thirdly, human inspections were performed for further selections, and then 272 SL-QSO candidates were eventually found in total, including 16 high-score, 118 median-score, and 138 lower-score candidates, separately. Removing the systems already confirmed or identified in other papers, we end up with 229 SL-QSO candidates, including 7 high-score, 95 median-score, and 127 lower-score candidates, and the corresponding catalog is publicly available online.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) has provided the largest and most astrometrically precise catalogue of nearby stars to date, allowing for a more complete membership census of nearby, young stellar moving groups. These loose associations of young (age $<$100 Myr) stars within $\sim$100 pc are vital laboratories for the study of the early evolution of low-mass stars and planetary systems. We have exploited DR3 data to examine the boundary region between two of the youngest nearby moving groups, the $\sim$3--8 Myr-old $\epsilon$ Cha Association (ECA) and an $\sim$8 Myr-old sub-population of the sprawling Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) young star complex. Using spatio-kinematic and color-magnitude criteria designed to select stars in the ECA, we identify $\sim$54 new young-star candidates that extend from the ECA core to the southern edge of the LCC. Included among our new candidates are six previously unidentified ultra-low-mass, mid- to late-M stars, lying near the future hydrogen-burning limit, that display significant infrared excesses. Our spatial, kinematic, and CMD analysis of these new candidates and previously established LCC and ECA members blurs the boundary between these groups and provides evidence for a wave of continuous star formation extending from north (LCC) to south (ECA). We discuss the factors which studies of nearby young moving groups must consider when constraining the ages of stars in these groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumstellar material (CSM) produced by mass loss from massive stars ($\gtrsim10 M_{\odot}$) through strong stellar winds or binary stripping provides rich information for understanding progenitors of core-collapse supernova remnants. In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a Galactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary system according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 was experienced a strong mass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material produced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central belt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N VII Ly$\alpha$ line (0.50 keV) for the first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is significantly lower (N/O$=0.5\pm0.1$) than the solar value. This low N/O suggests that the progenitor of experienced strong mass-loss and ended up to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star exposing the He-burning layer at the pre-supernova. Comparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss enough to occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of evidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of G292.0+1.8.
#### Magnetised HI superbubbles in the Small Magellanic Cloud revealed by the POSSUM pilot survey

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) bubbles and shells are common in the interstellar medium (ISM). Studying their properties provides insight into the characteristics of the local ISM as well as the galaxy in which the bubbles reside. We report the detection of magnetic fields associated with superbubbles in the nearby irregular galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Using the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) pilot survey, we obtain a high-density grid ($\approx 25 \,\rm sources\,deg^{-2}$) of Faraday rotation measure (RM) from polarized sources behind the SMC. This provides a sufficiently large number of RM measurements to study the magnetic properties of three of the largest HI shells previously identified in the SMC. The RM profiles as a function of distance from the shell centre show characteristic patterns at angular scales comparable to the shell size. We demonstrate that this can be explained by magneto-hydrodynamic simulation models of bubbles expanding in magnetised environments. From the observations, we estimate the line-of-sight magnetic field strength at the edges of the shells is enhanced by $\sim1\,\rm \mu G$ with respect to their centres. This is an order of magnitude larger than the field strength in the ambient medium ($\sim 0.1\,\rm \mu G$) estimated based on the expansion velocity of the shells. This paper highlights the power of densely mapped RM grids in studying the magnetic properties of galactic substructures beyond the Milky Way.
#### Convective vortices in collapsing stars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies show that non-radial structures arising from massive star shell convection play an important role in shaping core-collapse supernova explosions. During the collapse phase, convective vortices generate acoustic waves that interact with the supernova shock. This amplifies turbulence in the post-shock region, contributing to explosion. We study how various physical parameters influence the evolution of these convective vortices during stellar collapse using simplified simulations. We model the collapsing star with a transonic Bondi flow and represent convection as solenoidal velocity perturbations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, demonstrating that the peak perturbation amplitude scales linearly with the pre-collapse convective Mach number and inversely with the angular wavenumber of convection. While the shell radius and width primarily determine the timescale of accretion, they have little impact on the peak perturbation amplitudes. Finally, we show that when the convective Mach number is below approximately 0.2, the dynamics remain within the linear regime.
#### Advanced Classification of Hot Subdwarf Binaries Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques and Gaia DR3 data

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarfs are compact blue evolved objects, burning helium in their cores surrounded by a tiny hydrogen envelope. Most models agree on a common envelope binary evolution scenario in the Red Giant phase. However, the binarity rate for these objects is yet unsolved. We aim to develop a novel classification method for identifying hot subdwarf binaries within large datasets using Artificial Intelligence methods and Gaia DR3 data. The results will be compared with those obtained previously using VOSA (Virtual Observatory Sed Analyzer) on coincident samples. The methods include several machine learning techniques. We used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify 3084 hot subdwarf stars based on their color-magnitude properties. Of these, 2815 objects have Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP spectra, which were classified using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The findings demonstrate a high agreement level (70-90%) with VOSA's classification, indicating that machine learning methods effectively classify sources with an accuracy comparable to human inspection or non-AI techniques. SVM in a radial basis function achieves 70.97% reproducibility for binary targets using photometry. CNN reaches 84.94% for binary detection using spectroscopy. We also found that the single-binary differences are especially observable on the infrared flux in our GDR3 BP/BR spectra, at wavelengths larger than 700 nm. We found that all our methods are effective in discerning between single and binary systems and are consistent with the results previously obtained with VOSA. In global terms, considering all quality metrics, CNN is the method that provides the best accuracy. The methods are also effective for detecting peculiarities in the spectra. Further research is needed to refine our techniques and enhance automated classification reliability, especially for large-scale surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Early-type stars have convective cores due to a steep temperature gradient produced by the CNO cycle. These cores can host dynamos, and the generated magnetic fields can be relevant to explain the magnetism observed in Ap/Bp stars. Our main objective is to characterise the convective core dynamos and differential rotation, and to do the first quantitative analysis of the relation between magnetic activity cycle and rotation period. We use numerical 3D star-in-a-box simulations of a $2.2~M_\odot$ A-type star with a convective core of roughly $20\%$ of the stellar radius surrounded by a radiative envelope. Rotation rates from 8 to 20 days are explored. We use two models of the entire star, and an additional zoom set, where $50\%$ of the radius is retained. The simulations produce hemispheric core dynamos with cycles and typical magnetic field strengths around 60 kG. However, only a very small fraction of the magnetic energy is able to reach the surface. The cores have solar-like differential rotation, and a substantial part of the radiative envelope has quasi-rigid rotation. In the most rapidly rotating cases the magnetic energy in the core is roughly 40\% of the kinetic energy. Finally, we find that the magnetic cycle period $P_\mathrm{cyc}$ increases with decreasing the rotation period $P_\mathrm{rot}$ which is also observed in many simulations of solar-type stars. Our simulations indicate that a strong hemispherical core dynamo arises routinely, but that it is not enough the explain the surface magnetism of Ap/Bp stars. Nevertheless, as the core dynamo produces dynamically relevant magnetic fields it should not be neglected when other mechanisms are explored.
