 - **Abstract**
 The light curves of radioactive transients, such as supernovae and kilonovae, are powered by the decay of radioisotopes, which release high-energy leptons through $\beta^+$ and $\beta^-$ decays. These leptons deposit energy into the expanding ejecta. As the ejecta density decreases during expansion, the plasma becomes collisionless, with particle motion governed by electromagnetic forces. In such environments, strong or turbulent magnetic fields are thought to confine particles, though the origin of these fields and the confinement mechanism have remained unclear. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate that plasma instabilities can naturally confine high-energy leptons. These leptons generate magnetic fields through plasma streaming instabilities, even in the absence of pre-existing fields. The self-generated magnetic fields slow lepton diffusion, enabling confinement and transferring energy to thermal electrons and ions. Our results naturally explain the positron trapping inferred from late-time observations of thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, they suggest potential implications for electron dynamics in the ejecta of kilonovae. We also estimate synchrotron radio luminosities from positrons for Type Ia supernovae and find that such emission could only be detectable with next-generation radio observatories from a Galactic or local-group supernova in an environment without any circumstellar material.

 - **Abstract**
 This study comprehensively analyzes three open star clusters: SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86 using Gaia DR3 data. Based on the ASteCA code, we determined the most probable star candidates (P >= 50%) and estimated the number of star members of each cluster as 125, 158, and 138, respectively. We estimated the internal structural parameters by fitting the King model to the observed RDPs, including the core, limited, and tidal radii. The isochrone fitting to the color-magnitude diagram provided log(age) values of 9.13 +/- 0.04, 8.10 +/- 0.04, and 8.65 +/- 0.04 and distances of 3790 +/- 94 pc, 3900 +/- 200 pc, and 3120 +/- 30 pc for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. We also calculated their projected distances from the Galactic plane (X_sun, Y_sun) as well as their vertical distances (Z_sun), Galactocentric distances (R_gc), and total masses (M_C) in solar units, which are about 142 +/- 12, 302 +/- 17, and 192 +/- 14 for SAI 16, SAI 81, and SAI 86, respectively. Examining the dynamical relaxation state indicates that all three clusters are dynamically relaxed. By undertaking a kinematic analysis of the cluster data, the space velocity was determined. We calculated the coordinates of the apex point (A_o, D_o) using the AD diagram method along with the derivation of the solar motion parameters (S_sun, l_A, b_A). Through our detailed dynamic orbit analysis, we determined that the three SAI clusters belong to the young stellar disc, confirming their membership within this component of the Galactic structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Multiphase gas can be found in many astrophysical environments, such as galactic outflows, stellar wind bubbles, and the circumgalactic medium, where the interplay between turbulence, cooling, and viscosity can significantly influence gas dynamics and star formation processes. We investigate the role of viscosity in modulating turbulence and radiative cooling in turbulent radiative mixing layers (TRMLs). In particular, we aim to determine how different amounts of viscosity affect the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), turbulence evolution, and the efficiency of gas mixing and cooling. Using idealized 2D numerical setups, we compute the critical viscosity required to suppress the KHI in shear flows characterized by different density contrasts and Mach numbers. These results are then used in a 3D shear layer setup to explore the impact of viscosity on cooling efficiency and turbulence across different cooling regimes. We find that the critical viscosity follows the expected dependence on overdensity and Mach number. Our viscous TRMLs simulations show different behaviors in the weak and strong cooling regimes. In the weak cooling regime, viscosity has a strong impact, resulting in laminar flows and breaking previously established inviscid relations between cooling and turbulence (albeit leaving the total luminosity unaffected). However, in the strong cooling regime, when cooling timescales are shorter than viscous timescales, key scaling relations in TRMLs remain largely intact. In this regime -- which must hold for gas to remain multiphase -- radiative losses dominate, and the system effectively behaves as non-viscous regardless of the actual level of viscosity. Our findings have direct implications for both the interpretation of observational diagnostics and the development of subgrid models in large-scale simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Using JWST near-infrared data of the inner Orion Nebula, \citet{Pearson_McCaughrean_2023} detected 40 binary systems they proposed to be Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) -- although their actual nature is still in debate. Only one of the objects, JuMBO\,24, was detected in the radio continuum. Here, we report on new radio continuum (10 GHz) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detections of the radio counterpart to JuMBO\,24, and on an unsuccessful search for 5 GHz continuum emission with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA). From our new VLA detections and adopting a distance to the region, we set an upper limit of $\simeq 6$~km~s$^{-1}$ to the velocity of the radio source in the plane of the sky. This upper limit favors an origin for this source similar to that of stars, that is, from a stationary contracting core. The nature of the radio emission remains uncertain but the lack of strong variability (all VLA observations are consistent with a steady flux of $\sim$50 $\mu$Jy), of detection on long HSA baseline, and of detectable circular polarization in VLA data do not favor a non-thermal origin.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports on the detection of a likely explosive outflow in the high-mass star-forming complex G34.26+0.15, adding to the small number (six) of explosive outflows detected so far. ALMA CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) archival observations reveal multiple outflow streamers from G34.26+0.15, which correlate well with H2 jets identified from Spitzer-IRAC 4.5 um and [4.5]/[3.6] flux ratio maps. These nearly linear outflow streamers originate from a common center within an ultracompact HII region located in the complex. The velocity spread of the outflow streamers ranges from 0 to 120 km/s. The radial velocities of these streamers follow the Hubble-Lemaître velocity law, indicating an explosive nature. From the CO emission, the total outflow mass, momentum, and outflow energy are estimated to be ~264 M_sun, 4.3*10^3 M_sun km/s, and 10^48 erg, respectively. The event triggering the outflow may have occurred about 19,000 years ago and could also be responsible for powering the expanding UC HII region, given the similar dynamical ages and positional coincidence of the UC HII region with the origin of the outflow. The magnetic field lines in the region associated with G34.26+0.15 also appear to align with the direction of the outflow streamers and jets, possibly being dragged by the explosive outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 SiO masers from AGB stars exhibit variability in intensity and polarization during a pulsation period. This variability is explained by radiative transfer and magnetic properties of the molecule. To investigate this phenomenon, a 3D maser simulation is employed to study the SiO masers based on Zeeman splitting. We demonstrate that the magnetic field direction affects maser polarization within small tubular domains with isotropic pumping, and yields results that are similar to those obtained from 1D modelling. This work also studies larger clouds with different shapes. We use finite-element domains with internal node distributions to represent the maser-supporting clouds. We calculate solutions for the population inversions in all transitions and at every node. These solutions show that saturation begins near the middle of a domain, moving towards the edges and particularly the ends of long axes, as saturation progresses, influencing polarization. When the observer's view of the domain changes, the plane of linear polarization responds to the projected shape and the projected magnetic field axis. The angle between the observer's line of sight and the magnetic field may cause jumps in the plane of polarization. Therefore, we can conclude that polarization is influenced by both the cloud's major axis orientation and magnetic field direction. We have investigated the possibility of explaining observed polarization plane rotations, apparently within a single cloud, by the mechanism of line-of-sight overlap of two magnetized maser clouds.
#### Stochastic low-frequency variability of 50 massive stars in the Cygnus OB associations and the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, high-precision high-cadence space photometry has revealed that stochastic low frequency (SLF) variability is common in the light curves of massive stars. We use the data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to study and characterize the SLF variability found in a sample of 49 O- and B-type main-sequence stars across six Cygnus OB~associations and one low-metallicity SMC star AV~232. We compare these results to 53 previously studied SLF variables. We adopt two different methods for characterizing the signal. In the first, we follow earlier work and fit a Lorentzian-like profile to the power density spectrum of the residual light curve to derive the amplitude $\alpha_0$, characteristic frequency $\nu_{\rm char}$, and slope $\gamma$ of the variability. In our second model-independent method, we calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) of the photometric variability as well as the frequency at 50\% of the accumulated power spectral density, $\nu_{50\%}$, and the width of the cumulative integrated power density, $w$. For the full sample of 103 SLF variables, we find that $\alpha_0$, $\gamma$, RMS, $\nu_{50\%}$, and $w$ correlate with the spectroscopic luminosity of the stars. Both $\alpha_0$ and RMS appear to increase for more evolved stars whereas $\nu_{\rm char}$ and $\nu_{50\%}$ both decrease. Finally, we compare our results to 2-D and 3-D simulations of subsurface convection, core-generated internal gravity waves, and surface stellar winds, and find good agreement between the observed $\nu_{\rm char}$ of our sample and predictions from sub-surface convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Eclipsing binary systems (EBs), as foundational objects in stellar astrophysics, have garnered significant attention in recent years. These systems exhibit periodic decreases in light intensity when one star obscures the other from the observer's perspective, producing characteristic light curves (LCs). With the advent of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a vast repository of stellar LCs has become available, offering unprecedented opportunities for discovering new EBs. To efficiently identify such systems, we propose a novel method that combines LC data and generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms (GLS) data to classify EBs. At the core of this method is CNN Attention LSTM Net (CALNet), a hybrid deep learning model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and an Attention Mechanism based on the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We collected 4,225 EB samples, utilizing their 2-minute cadence LCs for model training and validation. CALNet achieved a recall rate of 99.1%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Applying it to TESS 2-minute LCs from Sectors 1 to 74, we identified 9,351 new EBs after manual visual inspection, significantly expanding the known sample size. This work highlights the potential of advanced deep-learning techniques in large-scale astronomical surveys and provides a valuable resource for further studies on EBs.

 - **Abstract**
 The infrared (IR) to X-ray luminosity ratio (IRX) is an indicator of the role of the dust plays in cooling of hot gas in supernova remnants (SNR). Using the 3D dynamics of gas and interstellar polydisperse dust grains we analyze the evolution of SNR in the inhomogeneous medium. We obtain spatial distributions of the surface brigthness both of the X-ray emission from hot gas inside SNR and the IR emission from the SNR swept-up shell, as well as, the average gas temperature in the SNR, $T_X$. We find that the IRX changes significantly (by a factor of $\sim 3-30$) as a function of impact distance within the SNR and its age. In a low inhomogeneous medium the IRX drops rapidly during the SNR evolution. On the other hand, if large inhomogeneities are present in the medium, the IRX is maintained at higher levels during the late SNR evolution at radiative phase due to replenishment of dust in the hot gas by incompletely destroyed fragments behind the shock front. We show that the onset of the radiative phase determines the evolution of the $T_X - {\rm IRX}$ diagram. We illustrate that decreasing gas metallicity or density leads to high values of temperature and IRX ratio. We discuss how our results can be applied to the observational data to analyse the SNR older than 10 kyr (i.e. when the mass of the swept-up dust in the shell is expected to exceed that produced in the SNR) in the Galaxy and Large Magellanic Cloud.
#### A Novel Relationship Between Gamma Ray Burst Duration And Photospheric Radius

 - **Abstract**
 Long Gamma Ray Bursts (lGRBs) are associated with jets in Type Ic broadline supernovae. The Collapsar model provides a theoretical framework for the jet formation from the core collapse of a massive star in such supernovae. The GRB can only be produced after a successful jet break out from the star. Under this formalism the GRB duration ($t_{\rm{90}}$) has been hypothesized to be the difference between the central engine activity duration ($t_{\rm{eng}}$) and the jet breakout time ($t_{\rm{bo}}$), that is $t_{\rm{90}} = t_{\rm{eng}} - t_{\rm{bo}}$. This disallows $t_{\rm{90}} > t_{\rm{eng}}$ and puts a lower bound on successful lGRB jet central engine duration ($t_{\rm{eng}} > t_{\rm{bo}}$), various numerical simulations have shown otherwise. This study considers a photospheric GRB emission from a relativistic jet punching out of a Wolf-Rayet-like star. We use the bolometric lightcurve generated to calculate the lGRB duration ($t_{\rm{90}}$) for varying engine duration. We find for longer engine duration the lGRB lightcurve reflects the jet profile and $t_{\rm{90}} \approx t_{\rm{eng}}$. While for shorter engine duration, the $t_{\rm{90}}$ has photospheric radius ($R_{\rm{ph}}$) dependence. This can be modeled by a relation, $t_{\rm{90}} = t^{\rm{90}}_{\rm{eng}} + 0.03\left(\frac{R_{\rm{ph}}}{c}\right)$, where c is the speed of light, with a lower bound on $t_{\rm{90}}$ for a successful lGRB. This relation should be most relevant for possible low-luminous lGRBs originating from a collapsar with central engine duration comparable to the jet breakout time.
