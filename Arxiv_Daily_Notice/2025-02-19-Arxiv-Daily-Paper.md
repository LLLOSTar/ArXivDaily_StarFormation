 - **Abstract**
 Solar photospheric abundances and CI-chondrite compositions are reviewed and updated to obtain representative solar system abundances of the elements and their isotopes. The new photospheric abundances obtained here lead to higher solar metallicity. Full 3D NLTE photospheric analyses are only available for 11 elements. A quality index for analyses is introduced. For several elements, uncertainties remain large. Protosolar mass fractions are H (X = 0.7060), He (Y = 0.2753), and for metals Li to U (Z = 0.0187). The protosolar (C+N)/H agrees within 13% with the ratio for the solar core from the Borexino experiment. Elemental abundances in CI-chondrites were screened by analytical methods, sample sizes, and evaluated using concentration frequency distributions. Aqueously mobile elements (e.g., alkalis, alkaline earths, etc.) often deviate from normal distributions indicating mobilization and/or sequestration into carbonates, phosphates, and sulfates. Revised CI-chondrite abundances of non-volatile elements are similar to earlier estimates. The moderately volatile elements F and Sb are higher than before, as are C, Br and I, whereas the CI-abundances of Hg and N are now significantly lower. The solar system nuclide distribution curves of s-process elements agree within 4% with s-process predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models. P-process nuclide distributions are assessed. No obvious correlation of CI-chondritic to solar elemental abundance ratios with condensation temperatures is observed, nor is there one for ratios of CI-chondrites/solar wind abundances.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a wide-field $(60\arcmin \times 30\arcmin)$ study of a dense region within the Polaris Flare, hereafter referred to as the `Polaris molecular cloud', using $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J=1-0$) observations at $20\arcsec$ resolution, obtained with the Nobeyama 45 m Radio Telescope. The analysis reveals molecular gas formation occurring at column densities up to $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, evidenced by an anti-correlation between $\textsc{Hi}$ and CO distributions, indicating active atomic-to-molecular gas conversion. We found a threshold column density for molecular formation at $\sim5\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is common among more evolved molecular clouds. The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, $X_{\rm CO}$, was found to be $0.7 \times 10^{20}$ H$_2$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$, lower than the solar neighborhood average. Our chemical models estimate the cloud's age to be $\sim10^{5}-10^{6}$ years, suggesting an early stage of molecular cloud evolution. This interpretation is consistent with the observed low $X_{\rm CO}$ factor. While virial analysis suggests that the entire cloud is gravitationally unbound, we identified several filamentary structures extending from the main cloud body. These filaments show systematic velocity gradients of $0.5-1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$, and analysis of the velocities shows that the molecular gas within them is falling toward the main cloud body, following a free-fall model. This suggests ongoing mass accumulation processes through the filaments, demonstrating that gravitational processes can be important even at column densities of $\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations

 - **Abstract**
 The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.

 - **Abstract**
 The warm neutral medium (WNM) was thought to be subsonically/transonically turbulent, and it lacks a network of intertwined filaments that are commonly seen in both molecular clouds and cold neutral medium (CNM). Here, we report HI~21 cm line observations of a very-high-velocity (-330 km s$^{-1}$ $<V_{\rm LSR}<$ -250 km s$^{-1}$) cloud (VHVC), using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. For the first time, such a VHVC is clearly revealed to be a supersonic WNM system consisting of a network of velocity-coherent HI~filaments. The filaments are in the forms of slim curves, hubs, and webs, distributed in different layers within the position-position-velocity ({\it ppv}) data cube. The entire cloud has skewed log-normal probability distribution of column density and the filaments themselves show asymmetrical radial density profiles, indicating shock compression by supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, as is also confirmed by our MHD simulation (sonic Mach number $M_{\rm s}=3$ and Alfvén Mach number $M_{\rm A}=1$). This work suggests that hierarchical filaments can be established by shocks in a low-density WNM, where gravity is negligible, offering a viable pathway to structure formation in the earliest evolutionary phases of the interstellar medium (ISM).
#### The Impact of $^{12}$C($α, γ$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the Presupernova Evolution and Explodability of Massive Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of massive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\odot$ and the solar metallicity. We show that the {\sl explodability} of these stars, i.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive to the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass fractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further enhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is strengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the contraction of outer layers and decrease the {\sl compactness parameter} at $M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores of Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell in the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the model is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the pressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar structure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning shell above which the model is more likely to explode. We conclude that the smaller $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate makes the mass range of $M ({\rm ZAMS})$ that forms a NS larger.
#### Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets: II. Viewing Angle Effect on the Prompt Emission and Application to GRB 170817A

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger observations suggest that the gamma-ray burst on Aug. 17, 2017 (GRB 170817A) resulted from off-axial observations of its structured jet, which consists of a narrow ultra-relativistic jet core surrounded by a wide mild-relativistic cocoon. In a serious paper, we explore the emission of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region in a series of papers. This paper focuses on the viewing angle effect for a structured jet by considering the emission from the shear-accelerated electrons. It is found that the observed synchrotron emission peaks at the Infrared band and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission peaks at the band of hundreds of keV. They are not sensitive to the viewing angle. In the off-axis observations scenario, the prompt emission spectrum is dominated by the emission of the shear-accelerated electrons. The prompt gamma-ray spectrum of GRB 170817A can be well explained with our model by setting the velocity of the inner edge of the cocoon region as 0.9c, the magnetic field strength as 21 G, the injected initial electron Lorentz factor as $10^3$, and the viewing angle as 0.44 rad. We argue that the joint observations in the Infrared/optical and X-ray bands are critical to verify our model.

 - **Abstract**
 As the Galactic tide acts to decouple bodies from the scattered disk it creates a spiral structure in physical space that is roughly 15,000 au in length. The spiral is long-lived and persists in the inner Oort cloud to the present time. Here we discuss dynamics underlying the Oort spiral and (feeble) prospects for its observational detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Projects aiming to detect gravitational waves (GWs) in space in the millihertz range will utilize interferometers to measure the separations between free-falling test masses. The phasemeter measures the phase changes of the interference signals caused by the test masses' relative movements. The measurement sensitivity of the phasemeter is one of the key factors in the detection. In this work, we reviewed the core metrology of the phasemeter and evaluated the ultra-low noise performance of the phasemeter with analog signals. Frequency readout noise related to the bit width of the numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) inside the phasemeter is identified as one of the main noise sources of phase measurement theoretically and experimentally. After increasing the NCO bit widths, the single-channel phase noise of the phasemeter reached 2.0 {\mu}rad/Hz^{1/2} at 6 mHz, and the differential phase noise reached 0.4 {\mu}rad/Hz^{1/2} at 6 mHz. The phase noise performances remained consistent within the carrier frequency range of 4.9 MHz to 25.1 MHz.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multimessenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437$-$4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437$-$4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, concincide with the rough mass range of PSR J0437$-$4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437$-$4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.
#### Multi-mode Pulsations in AGB Stars: Insights from 3D RHD CO5BOLD Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Stars on the AGB can exhibit acoustic pulsation modes of different radial orders, along with non-radial modes. These pulsations are essential to the mass-loss process and influence the evolutionary pathways of AGB stars. P-L relations serve as a valuable diagnostic for understanding stellar evolution along the AGB. 3D RHD simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating pulsation phenomena driven by convective processes and their non-linear coupling with stellar oscillations. We investigate multi-mode pulsations in AGB stars using advanced 3D 'star-in-a-box' simulations with the CO5BOLD code. Signatures of these multi-mode pulsations were weak in our previous 3D models. Our focus is on identifying and characterising the various pulsation modes, examining their persistence and transitions, and comparing the results with 1D model predictions and observational data where applicable. We produced a new model grid comprising AGB stars with current masses of $0.7$, $0.8$, and $1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Fourier analysis was applied to dynamic, time-dependent quantities to extract dominant pulsation modes and their corresponding periods. Additionally, wavelet transforms were employed to identify mode-switching behaviour over time. The models successfully reproduce the P-L sequences found in AGB stars. Mode-switching phenomena are found in both the models and wavelet analyses of observational data, allowing us to infer similarities in the underlying pulsation dynamics. These 3D simulations highlight the natural emergence of multi-mode pulsations, including both radial and non-radial modes, driven by the self-consistent interplay of convection and oscillations. Our findings underscore the value of 3D RHD models in capturing the non-linear behaviour of AGB pulsations, providing insights into mode switching, envelope structures, and potential links to episodic mass-loss events.
#### 3D Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation and the dynamics of vortex lines in rotating scalar dark matter halos, focusing on models with quartic repulsive self-interactions. In the nonrelativistic regime, vortex lines and their lattices arise from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of motion, as for superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates studied in laboratory experiments. Indeed, in such systems vorticity is supported by the singularities of the phase of the scalar field, which leads to a discrete set of quantized vortices amid a curl-free velocity background. In the continuum limit where the number of vortex lines becomes very large, we find that the equilibrium solution is a rotating soliton that obeys a solid-body rotation, with an oblate density profile aligned with the direction of the total spin. This configuration is dynamically stable provided the rotational energy is smaller than the self-interaction and gravitational energies. Using numerical simulations in the Thomas-Fermi regime, with stochastic initial conditions for a spherical halo with a specific averaged density profile and angular momentum, we find that a rotating soliton always emerges dynamically, within a few dynamical times, and that a network of vortex lines aligned with the total spin fills its oblate profile. These vertical vortex lines form a regular lattice in the equatorial plane, in agreement with the analytical predictions of uniform vortex density and solid-body rotation. These vortex lines might further extend between halos to form the backbone of spinning cosmic filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We need to understand the spin evolution of massive stars to compute their internal rotationally induced mixing processes, isolate effects of close binary evolution, and predict the rotation rates of white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. Aims. We discuss the spindown of massive main sequence stars imposed by stellar winds. Methods. We use detailed grids of single star evolutionary models to predict the distribution of the surface rotational velocities of core-hydrogen burning Galactic massive stars as function of their mass and evolutionary state. We then compare the spin properties of our synthetic populations with appropriately selected sub-samples of Galactic main sequence OB-type stars extracted from the IACOB survey. Results. We find that below $\sim 40 M_\odot$, observations and models agree in finding that the surface rotational velocities of Galactic massive stars remain relatively constant during their main sequence evolution. The more massive stars in the IACOB sample appear to spin down less than predicted, while our updated angular momentum loss prescription predicts an enhanced spindown. Furthermore, the observations show a population of fast rotators, with $v \sin I \gtrsim 200$ km/s persisting for all ages, which is not reproduced by our synthetic single star populations. Conclusions. We conclude that the wind-induced spindown of massive main sequence stars is yet to be fully understood, and that close binary evolution might significantly contribute to the fraction of rapid rotators in massive stars.
