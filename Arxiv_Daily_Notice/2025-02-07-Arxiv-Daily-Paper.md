 - **Abstract**
 Astrometry from Gaia has enabled discovery of three dormant black holes (BHs) in au-scale binaries. Numerous models have been proposed to explain their formation, including several that have forecasted Gaia detections. However, previous works have used simplified detectability metrics that do not capture key elements of the Gaia astrometric orbit selection function. We apply a realistic forward-model of Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs to BH binary populations generated through (a) isolated binary evolution (IBE) and (b) dynamical formation in star clusters. For both formation channels, we analyze binary populations in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map. We generate epoch astrometry for each binary from the Gaia scanning law and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models used in Gaia DR3. The IBE model of Chawla et al. (2022) predicts that no BH binaries should have been detected in DR3 and thus significantly underpredicts the formation rate of Gaia BHs. In contrast, the dynamical model of Di Carlo et al. (2024) overpredicts the number of BHs receiving DR3 orbital solutions by a factor of $\sim$8. The two models predict very different orbital period distributions, with the IBE model predicting only binaries that avoided common envelope evolution and have $P_{\text{orb}} \gtrsim 2,000$ d to be detectable, and the dynamical formation model predicting a period distribution that is roughly log-uniform. Adopting the dynamical channel as a fiducial model and rescaling by a factor of 1/8 to match DR3, we predict that $\sim$30 BH binaries will be detected in Gaia DR4, representing $\sim0.1\%$ of Milky Way BHs with luminous companions in au-scale orbits.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of spin 0, spin 1 and spin 2 Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM) on small scales by numerically solving the Schrödinger-Poisson system using the time-split method. We perform simulations of ULDM for each spin, starting with different numbers of identical initial solitons and analyse the properties of the resulting halos after they merge and relax in a steady-state. Our findings reveal that higher spin values lead to broader, less dense final halo with more prominent Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) tails, a characteristic that persists regardless of the number of initial solitons involved. We identify scaling relations that describe the density profile, core and NFW tail of spin $s$ ULDM halos as a function of the number of initial solitons $N_{sol}$. These relations allow us to construct equivalent halos based on average density or total mass, for arbitrarily large $N_{sol}$, without having to simulate those systems. We simulate the orbit of a ULDM satellite in a constructed halo treated as an external potential, and find that for host halos having the same average density, the orbital decay time of the satellite is as predicted for uniform sphere host halo regardless of the spin. However, satellites orbiting haloes having the same mass for each spin, result in faster disruption in the case of spin 0, while satellites orbiting haloes having the same core size result in faster disruption in the case of spin 2.
#### Environmental effects on nearby debris discs

 - **Abstract**
 We probe the effect of the ISM on debris disc occurrence rates and on the morphologies of the discs. We used results from the Herschel Space Observatory DUNES and DEBRIS surveys of 295 nearby FGK dwarf stars imaged at 100 $\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m. Most of the 48 debris discs in this sample have small optical depths, making them more likely to be affected by the ISM compared to optically thick discs. Since the stars in our sample are located within the Local Interstellar Cloud, we can infer that their debris discs encounter similar conditions. This allows us to use the stellar space velocity as a single indicator of the forces that can act on the debris disc dust grains when they interact with the ISM. The observed debris disc occurrence rates seem to depend on the stellar space velocities, as expected under the hypothesis that stars with higher space velocities have a higher probability of losing their circumstellar dust. The percentage of sources with debris discs in our sample reaches a maximum of $\approx$25% for stars with low space velocity component values, $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$, relative to the local ISM, and decreases for larger $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ values down to the 10% level. A decrease in the average disc fractional luminosity as a function of $|U_{\mathrm{rel}}|$ is also observed. These dependences do not disappear after accounting for the reported higher dispersion of $U$ values with age. In extended discs, the impact of the ISM could also explain the links observed between the stellar space velocities and the debris disc projected ellipticities, position angles, and radii. Although these indications may not be fully conclusive on their own, they collectively reinforce the hypothesis that the ISM influences the occurrence rates and morphologies of debris discs.
#### Measuring the Sun's Core with Neutrino Measurements: A Solar Orbiter Concept

 - **Abstract**
 Traditional neutrino detectors are built deep underground to reduce backgrounds. The neutrino solar orbiting laboratory ($\nu$SOL) collaboration has been developing a concept to improve neutrino measurement not with a larger detector underground, but instead we use the nuclear excitation from the neutrino interaction to produce a multi-pulse signal. Cerium-doped gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet (GAGG) is a new scintillator which has 23\% gallium by mass. When a neutrino interacts with the GAGG, about 10\% of the time it will be in an excited nuclear state rather than in the base energy level. A segmented detector looking for the pulses separated by distance and time has the potential to greatly limit background noise from solar wind, cosmic rays, and galactic gamma rays. A polar LEO CubeSat mission is currently in development to measure the GCR backgrounds outside the Van Allen Belts. In this summary of my presentation I will quickly lay the groundwork of the interaction of interest and what a solar orbiter's detector could look like. I will then explore what measurements a near-solar orbiter could make. With these measurements in mind, I will discuss the feasibility of a direct observation of the core's shape, and I will discuss how a solar orbiter's measurements could improve a Standard Solar Model search and compare that measurement with the current global neutrino measurements. I will conclude with a discussion of what these observables could tell us about the solar interior.
#### The GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the composite SNR CTB 87

 - **Abstract**
 We report the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the composite supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 87 with more than 16 yrs PASS 8 data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Two separate point sources with the different GeV spectra are identified in this region: one has a soft $\gamma$-ray spectrum, likely due to interactions between the SNR shock and molecular clouds (MCs); and another source with a hard GeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum aligns with the TeV spectrum of VER J2016+371, suggesting it as the GeV counterpart. Considering the observations of CTB 87 in the radio and X-ray bands, VER J2016+371 is proposed to originate from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J2016+3711. A leptonic model with a broken power-law electron distribution could explain the multi-wavelength data of VER J2016+371, with fitted parameters matching typical $\gamma$-ray PWNe. Deeper searching for the SNR shock of CTB 87 in other bands and the future TeV observations by LHAASO and CTA are crucial to reveal the nature of CTB 87.

 - **Abstract**
 The central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy exhibits widespread emission from SiO and various complex organic molecules (COMs), yet the exact origin of such emission is uncertain. Here we report the discovery of a unique class of long ($>$0.5 pc) and narrow ($<$0.03 pc) filaments in the emission of SiO 5$-$4 and eight additional molecular lines, including several COMs, in our ALMA 1.3 mm spectral line observations toward two massive molecular clouds in the CMZ, which we name as slim filaments. However, these filaments are not detected in the 1.3 mm continuum at the 5$\sigma$ level. Their line-of-sight velocities are coherent and inconsistent with being outflows. The column densities and relative abundances of the detected molecules are statistically similar to those in protostellar outflows but different from those in dense cores within the same clouds. Turbulent pressure in these filaments dominates over self gravity and leads to hydrostatic inequilibrium, indicating that they are a different class of objects than the dense gas filaments in dynamical equilibrium ubiquitously found in nearby molecular clouds. We argue that these newly detected slim filaments are associated with parsec-scale shocks, likely arising from dynamic interactions between shock waves and molecular clouds. The dissipation of the slim filaments may replenish SiO and COMs in the interstellar medium and lead to their widespread emission in the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Thin stellar streams, such as those resulting from the tidal disruption of globular clusters, have long been known and used as probes of the gravitational potential of our Galaxy, both its visible and dark contents. In particular, the presence of under-density regions, or gaps, along these streams is commonly interpreted as being due to the close passage of dark matter sub-halos. In this work, we investigate the perturbations induced on streams by the passage of dense stellar systems, such as globular clusters themselves, to test the possibility that they may cause the formation of gaps as well. In particular, we focus on the study of the stream of Palomar 5, a well-known globular cluster in the Galactic halo, which has particularly long tidal tails. For this purpose, we used a particle-test code to simulate Palomar 5's tidal tails when subjected to the Galaxy's gravitational field plus its whole system of globular clusters. Our study shows that the tails of Palomar 5 can be strongly perturbed by the close passage of other clusters, in particular of NGC 2808, NGC 7078, NGC 104, and that these perturbations induce the formation of gaps in the tails. These results show that globular clusters are capable of inducing gaps in streams--as other baryonic components such as giant molecular clouds and the galactic bar have been shown to do in other works. Therefore, when searching to construct the distribution function of dark matter sub halos within the Milky Way, the gap contribution from globular clusters must be included.

 - **Abstract**
 The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory is gearing up the formal construction of its two radio interferometers in Australia and South Africa after the end of design and pre-construction phases. Agile methodologies, the Cloud native Computing technologies and the DevOps software ideas are influencing the design of compute infrastructures that will be key to reduce the operational costs of SKA while improving the control and monitoring of the SKA antennas and ancillary systems, Correlators, HPC facilities or related data centre tiered systems. These tools will likely include advanced power metering technologies and efficient distribution automation and Network Operation Centres (NOC). SKA will become the world's largest radio telescope and is expected to achieve its first science by 2026. To cope with this dimension and complexity, a key part of this distributed Observatory is the overall software control and monitoring system embodied in the Observatory Management and Control (OMC) and the Services Teams that requires specialized Agile Teams to assist in software and cyber infrastructure building using an Agile development environment that includes test automation, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Deployment. To manage such a large and distributed machine, the Agile approach was adopted for the core software package of the SKA Telescope aimed at scheduling observations, controlling their execution, monitoring the telescope status and ensuring scalability and reliability. Here, we report on the ENGAGE SKA ciberinfrastructure prototyping support to the SKA Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusion models have been used in cosmological applications as a generative model for fast simulations and to reconstruct underlying cosmological fields or astrophysical images from noisy data. These two tasks are often treated as separate: diffusion models trained for one purpose do not generalize to perform the other task. In this paper, we develop a single diffusion model that can be used for both tasks. By using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) approach, we use a diffusion model trained to simulate weak lensing maps for the inverse problem of reconstructing mass maps from noisy weak lensing data. We find that the standard DPS method leads to biased inference but we correct this bias by down weighting the likelihood term at early sampling time steps of the diffusion. Our method give us a way to reconstruct accurate high-resolution (sub-arcminute) mass maps that have the correct power spectrum and a range of non-Gaussian summary statistics. We discuss several applications enabled by the computational efficiency and accuracy of our model. These include generation of simulation quality mass maps, aiding covariance estimation for higher order statistics, and for finding filaments, voids and clusters from noisy lensing shear data.
#### The Young Ages of 70 {\mu}m-dark Clumps Inferred from Carbon Chain Chemistry

 - **Abstract**
 The physical conditions of the earliest environment of high-mass star formation are currently poorly understood. To that end, we present observations of the carbon chain molecules HC$_5$N , CCS, and HC$_7$N in the 22-25 GHz band towards 12 high-mass 70 micron-dark clumps (SMDC) with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We detect HC$_5$N and CCS towards 11 of these SMDC sources. We calculate column densities and abundances relative to H$_2$ for HC$_5$N and CCS. We do not find any clear HC$_7$N detections in the 11 sources individually, but by stacking the HC$_7$N spectra, we do detect HC$_7$N on average in these sources. We also calculate the ratio of the column densities of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N using the stacked spectra of both species. We compare our measured abundances of HC$_5$N and our measured ratio of HC$_5$N to HC$_7$N to the UMIST dark cloud chemistry models to constrain an age for the gas assuming a fixed volume density and temperature. The chemical models favor a chemical evolutionary age less than 1 Myr at densities of n(H2) = 2 x 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. The consistent carbon-chain detections and young model-derived ages support the conclusion that these 11 70 micron-dark clumps lack high mass protostars because they are young and not because they are inefficient and incapable of high mass star formation.
