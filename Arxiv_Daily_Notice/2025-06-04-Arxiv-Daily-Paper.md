 - **Abstract**
 Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.

 - **Abstract**
 The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium. A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures (screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg, and Westerbork. Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being the result of very anisotropic scattering screens. We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties of $3^\circ$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of $140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $280\pm50{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual modulation patterns in the scintillation. Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local Bubble.
#### Interior redox state effects on the stability of secondary atmospheres and observational manifestations: LP 791-18 d as a case study for outgassing rocky exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in space and ground-based facilities now enable atmospheric characterization of a selected sample of rocky exoplanets. These atmospheres offer key insights into planetary formation and evolution, but their interpretation requires models that couple atmospheric processes with both the planetary interior and the surrounding space environment. This work focuses on the Earth-size planet LP791 18d, which is estimated to receive continuous tidal heating due to the orbital configuration of the system; thus, it is expected to exhibit volcanic activity. We estimate the mantle temperature of 1680-1880 K. Our results show that the atmospheric mean molecular weight gradient is controlled by oxygen fugacity rather than bulk metallicity. Furthermore, we use the atmospheric steady-state solutions produced from the interior redox state versus surface pressure parameter space and explore their atmospheric stability. We find that stability is achieved only in highly oxidized scenarios while reduced interior states fall into the hydrodynamic escape regime with mass loss rates on the order of 10^5-10^8 kg/s. We argue that scenarios with reduced interior states are likely to have exhausted their volatile budget during the planets lifetime. Furthermore, we predict the atmospheric footprint of the planets interior based on its oxidation state and assess its detectability using current or forthcoming tools to constrain the internal and atmospheric composition. We show that the degeneracy between bare rock surfaces and thick atmospheres can be resolved by using three photometric bands to construct a color-color diagram that accounts for potential effects from photochemical hazes and clouds. Our modeling approach connects interior and atmospheric processes, providing a basis to explore volatile evolution and potential habitability.
#### Long-Term Astrometric Monitoring of the Galactic Center Magnetar PSR J1745--2900

 - **Abstract**
 We present new astrometric observations of the Galactic Center magnetar, PSR J1745-2900, with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Combined with previously published measurements in 10 epochs that spanned 477 days, the complete data set consists of 25 epochs and 41 independent measurements that span 1984 days. These data constrain the proper motion to an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$ and set an upper limit on the absolute value of the magnetar's acceleration of $\lesssim (0.4, 0.2)\, {\rm mas\,y^{-2}}$ in the two celestial coordinates, consistent with the maximum value of $\sim 0.03\,{\rm mas\,y^{-2}}$ expected for an orbit around Sgr A*. Future measurements have the potential to detect the acceleration of PSR J1745-2900 due to Sgr A* should PSR J1745-2900 re-brighten. We consider several potential sources of systematic variations in the astrometric residuals after fitting for standard parameters, including refractive wander, changes in the structure of Sgr A*, and the presence of an unseen binary companion. While a stellar companion model can be fit to the astrometric data, pulse period measurements are inconsistent with that model. No changes in the apparent image size of the magnetar were detected over the duration of these observations, indicating a lack of change in the properties of the line-of-sight scattering during this period. We also show that the upper limit to the mean core shift of Sgr A* is consistent with expectations for a compact jet or symmetric accretion flow.
#### A chemical close-up of the main body of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the chemical composition of a sample of 37 red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to the main body of the remnant of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. All stars were observed with the FLAMES-UVES high-resolution spectrograph. Twenty-three new targets are selected along the blue side of the RGB of Sgr, but outside the galaxy stellar nucleus, in order to avoid contamination by the stars of the metal-poor globular cluster M54. Additionally, we re-analyzed archival spectra of fourteen targets located on the red RGB. For this sample, we derive the abundances of 21 chemical species (from Oxygen to Europium) representing different nucleosynthetic sites. The sample covers a large range of metallicity, from [Fe/H]~-2 to ~ -0.4 dex and we can identify the transition between the enrichment phases dominated by core-collapse (CC-SNe) and Type Ia (SNe-Ia) supernovae. The observed [{\alpha}/Fe] trend suggests a knee occurring at [Fe/H]~-1.5/-1.3 dex, compatible with the rather low star formation efficiency of Sgr. At lower [Fe/H], Sgr stars exhibit a chemical composition compatible with Milky Way stars of similar [Fe/H]. The only relevant exceptions are [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]. At [Fe/H] higher than ~ -1.5/-1.3 dex, instead, the chemical pattern of Sgr significantly deviates from that of the Milky Way for almost all the elements analyzed in this study. Some of the abundance patterns reveal a lower contribution by very massive stars exploding as hypernovae (e.g. [Mn/Fe], [Zn/Fe]), a higher contribution by sub-Chandrasekhar progenitors of SNe Ia (e.g. [Ni/Fe]) and a high production efficiency of rapid neutron-capture elements ([Eu/Fe]).

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02705

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02705

 - **Abstract**
 This technical note describes the design and modular implementation of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) adapted from residual networks (ResNet), developed for photometric regression tasks with an emphasis on low star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$) inference. The model features residual block structures optimized for sparse targets, with optional loss weighting and diagnostic tools for analyzing residual behavior. The implementation (version \texttt{v1.4}) originated during a collaborative project and is documented here independently. No external data are reproduced or analyzed. This note provides a reusable architectural reference for scalar regression problems in astronomy and related domains.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of comets requires knowledge of how the Solar System formed from a cloud of dust and gas 4.567 Gyr ago. Here, a review is presented of how the remnants of this formation process, meteorites and to a lesser extent comets, shed light on Solar System evolution. The planets formed by a process of collisional agglomeration during the first hundred million years of Solar System history. The vast majority of the original population of planetary building blocks (~100 km-scale planetesimals) was either incorporated into the planets or removed from the system, via dynamical ejection or through a collision with the Sun. Only a small fraction of the original rocky planetesimals survive to this day in the form of asteroids (which represent a total of ~0.05% of Earth's mass) and comets. Meteorites are fragments of asteroids that have fallen to Earth, thereby providing scientists with samples of Solar System-scale processes for laboratory-based analysis. Meteorite datasets complement cometary datasets, which are predominantly obtained via remote observation as there are few cometary samples currently available for laboratory-based measurements. This chapter discusses how analysis of the mineralogical, elemental, and isotopic characteristics of meteorites provides insight into (i) the origin of matter that formed planets, (ii) the pressure, temperature, and chemical conditions that prevailed during planet formation, and (iii) a precise chronological framework of planetary accretion. Also examined is the use of stable isotope variations and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies as constraints on the dynamics of the disk and planet formation, and how these data are integrated into new models of Solar System formation. It concludes with a discussion of Earth's accretion and its source of volatile elements, including water and organic species.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exploratory framework to test whether noise-like input can induce structured responses in language models. Instead of assuming that extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text, using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations, Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify data worth closer attention.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-frequency (18-24 GHz) radio continuum observations towards 335 methanol masers, excellent signposts for young, embedded high-mass protostars. These complete the search for hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions towards young high-mass star-forming clumps within the fourth quadrant of the Galactic plane. HCHII regions are the earliest observable signatures of radio continuum emission from high-mass stars ionizing their surroundings, though their rarity and short lifetimes make them challenging to study. We have observed methanol maser sites at 20-arcsec resolution and identified 121 discrete high-frequency radio sources. Of these, 42 compact sources are embedded in dense clumps and coincide with methanol masers, making them as excellent HCHII region candidates. These sources were followed up at higher resolution (0.5-arcsec) for confirmation. We constructed spectral energy distributions across 5-24 GHz to determine their physical properties, fitting either a simple HII region model or a power-law as needed. This analysis identified 20 HCHII regions, 9 intermediate objects, 3 UCHII regions, and 3 radio jet candidates. Combining these results with previous findings, the SCOTCH survey has identified 33 HCHII regions, 15 intermediate objects, 9 UCHII regions, and 4 radio jet candidates, tripling the known number of HCHII regions. Eleven of these sources remain optically thick at 24 GHz. This survey provides a valuable sample of the youngest HII regions and insights into early massive star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C$_2$H$_2$, CO$_2$ and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 $M_{\odot}$. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\mu$m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10$\mu$m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.
#### Distance to the Galactic centre 7$^\prime$ halo from HI absorption

 - **Abstract**
 Using archival data, we have made an HI absorption study of the 7$^\prime$ halo surrounding the Sgr A complex, observed towards the Galactic centre (GC) region. We find strong HI absorption near velocities of $-$53 km s$^{-1}$, which is due to the 3-kpc arm, placing it beyond 5 kpc from us. We further examined the HI absorption properties towards 5 different parts of the 7$^\prime$ halo. Absorption by +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC cloud is seen towards only 3 parts of the halo, but not towards the other 2 regions. Strong emissions in CO and CS are, however, identified toward all the above 5 parts of the halo by the +50 km s$^{-1}$ GC molecular cloud. This does show that the 7$^\prime$ halo is partly behind, and partly in front of the +50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. To our knowledge, this, for the first time clearly shows the 7$^\prime$ halo to be located at the same distance as the +50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, i.e., at the GC region.

 - **Abstract**
 Modern spectroscopic surveys output large data volumes. Theoretical models provide a means to transform the information encoded in these data to measurements of physical stellar properties. However, in detail the models are incomplete and simplified, and prohibit interpretation of the fine details in spectra. Instead, the available data provide an opportunity to use data-driven, differential analysis techniques, as a means towards understanding spectral signatures. We deploy such an analysis to examine core helium-fusing red clump (RC) and shell hydrogen-fusing red giant branch (RGB) stars, to uncover signatures of evolutionary state imprinted in optical stellar spectra. We exploit 786 pairs of RC and RGB stars from the GALAH survey, chosen to minimise spectral differences, with evolutionary state classifications from TESS and K2 asteroseismology. We report sub-percent residual, systematic spectral differences between the two classes of stars, and show that these residuals are significant compared to a reference sample of RC$-$RC and RGB$-$RGB pairs selected using the same criteria. First, we report systematic differences in the Swan ($\rm{C}_2$) band and CN bands caused by stellar evolution and a difference in mass, where RGB stars at similar stellar parameters have higher masses than RC stars. Secondly, we observe systematic differences in the line-width of the H$_{\alpha}$ and H$_{\beta}$ lines caused by a difference in microturbulence, as measured by GALAH, where we measure higher microturbulence in RC stars than RGB stars. This work demonstrates the ability of large surveys to uncover the subtle spectroscopic signatures of stellar evolution using model-free, data-driven methods.
