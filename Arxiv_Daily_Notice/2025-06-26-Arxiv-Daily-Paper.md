 - **Abstract**
 We present a near-infrared spectroscopic analysis (0.9-2.4 micron) of gravity indices for 57 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M5.5 to L0), including exoplanet hosts TRAPPIST-1, SPECULOOS-2, SPECULOOS-3, and LHS 3154. Our dataset includes 61 spectra from the SpeX and FIRE spectrographs. Using gravity-sensitive indices such as FeH absorption (at 0.99, 1.20, and 1.55 microns), the VO band at 1.06 microns, the H-band continuum, and alkali lines like K I (at 1.17 and 1.25 microns), we investigate correlations between surface gravity, stellar metallicity, and the presence of close-in transiting planets. All four planet-hosting stars show intermediate-gravity spectral signatures despite indicators of field age. However, a volume-corrected logistic regression reveals no significant association between gravity class and planet occurrence. Among individual indices, FeH_z is the most promising tracer of planet-hosting status. We tentatively identify a correlation between FeH_z (0.99 micron) and planet presence at the 2-sigma level, though this may reflect observational biases including transit probability, small-number statistics, and detection sensitivity. More robustly, we find a significant anti-correlation between FeH_z and metallicity ([Fe/H]) at 3.3 sigma. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows no significant metallicity difference across gravity classes, suggesting the observed FeH_z-metallicity trend is not driven by bulk metallicity differences. We propose this anti-correlation reflects interplay between age, gravity, and composition: higher-metallicity objects may be systematically younger with lower gravities, suppressing FeH absorption. While our results only hint at a link between gravity-related characteristics and planet occurrence among late-M dwarfs, they underscore the need for caution when using spectral diagnostics to infer properties of planet-hosting ultracool dwarfs.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of planetesimal debris accreted by white dwarfs offers unique insights into the composition of exoplanets. Using far-ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy, we have analysed the composition of planetesimals accreted by three metal enriched H-dominated white dwarfs with effective temperatures of T_eff = 20 000 K. WD 0059+257 is accreting an object composed of 71.8 +/- 7.9 per cent Fe and Ni by mass, indicating a large core mass fraction of 69 per cent, similar to that of Mercury. We model this planetesimal as having a differentiated Earth-like composition with 65 per cent of its mantle stripped, and we find this mass loss can be caused by vaporisation of the planetesimal's mantle during post-main sequence evolution. The tentative S detection in WD 0059+257 is a possible clue to the nature of the light element in planetary cores, including that of the Earth. The volatile-rich composition of WD 1943+163 is consistent with accretion of a carbonaceous chondrite-like object, but with an extreme Si depletion. WD 1953-715 accretes a planetesimal which contains 64 +/- 21 per cent of O in the form of ices, likely H2O. This body therefore requires an initial orbit at formation beyond a radial distance of > 100 au for ice survival into the white dwarf phase. These three planetary enriched white dwarfs provide evidence of differing core fractions, volatile budgets, and initial orbital separations of the accreted planetesimals, all of which help us understand their formation and evolutionary history.

 - **Abstract**
 The young M-star TWA 7 hosts a bright and near face-on debris disk, which has been imaged from the optical to the submillimeter. The disk displays multiple complex substructures such as three disk components, a large dust clump, and spiral arms, suggesting the presence of planets to actively sculpt these features. The evidence for planets in this disk was further strengthened with the recent detection of a point-source compatible with a Saturn-mass planet companion using JWST/MIRI at 11 $\mu$m, at the location a planet was predicted to reside based on the disk morphology. In this paper, we present new observations of the TWA 7 system with JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W filters. The disk is detected at both wavelengths and presents many of the same substructures as previously imaged, although we do not robustly detect the southern spiral arm. Furthermore, we detect two faint potential companions in the F444W filter at the 2-3$\sigma$ level. While one of these companions needs further followup to determine its nature, the other one coincides with the location of the planet candidate imaged with MIRI, providing further evidence that this source is a sub-Jupiter mass planet companion rather than a background galaxy. Such discoveries make TWA 7 only the second system, after $\beta$ Pictoris, in which a planet predicted by the debris disk morphology has been detected.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotation plays an important role in stellar evolution. However, the mechanisms behind the transport of angular momentum in stars at various stages of their evolution are not well understood. To improve our understanding of these processes, it is necessary to measure and validate the internal rotation profiles of stars across different stages of evolution and mass regimes. Our aim is to constrain the internal rotation profile of the 12Msun $\beta$ Cep pulsator HD 192575 from the observed pulsational multiplets and the asymmetries of their component frequencies. We update the forward asteroseismic modelling of HD 192575 based on new TESS observations. We invert for the rotation profile from the symmetric part of the splittings, and compute the multiplet asymmetries due to the Coriolis force and stellar deformation treated perturbatively. We compare the computed asymmetries with the observed asymmetries. Our new forward asteroseismic modelling is in agreement with previous results, but with increased uncertainties, partially due to increased frequency precision, requiring us to relax certain constraints. Ambiguity in the mode identification is the main source of the uncertainty, which also affects the inferred rotation profiles. Almost all acceptable rotation profiles occur in the regime below 0.4/d and favour weak radial differential rotation, with a ratio of core and envelope rotation below two. We find that the quality of the match between the observed and theoretically predicted mode asymmetries is strongly dependent on the mode identification and the internal structure of the star. Our results offer the first detailed rotation inversion for a $\beta$ Cep pulsator. They show that the rotation profile and the mode asymmetries provide a valuable tool to further constrain the evolutionary properties of HD 192575, and in particular the details of angular momentum transport in massive stars.
#### GAMA 526784: the progenitor of a globular cluster-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy? II. Molecular gas, neutral gas and environment

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and environment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation history, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the possible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods. We analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular gas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784. The potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed using photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a regular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular gas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be explained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to CO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion following a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas collapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc, shows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in GAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion may have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a high-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have undergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity. The presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed encounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in progress. We suggest this encounter may have shaped the system's recent evolution. Future observations, particularly targeting molecular gas tracers beyond CO and resolved HI maps, will be crucial in determining the extent of GAMA526784's cold gas reservoir and the nature of its recent star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The dusty interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way is distributed in a complex, cloudy structure. It is fundamental to the radiation balance within the Milky Way, provides a reaction surface to form complex molecules, and is the feedstock for future generations of stars and planets. The life cycle of interstellar dust is not completely understood, and neither are its structure nor composition. The abundance, composition, and structure of dust in the diffuse ISM can be determined by combining infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy. JWST enables measurement of the faint absorption of ISM dust grains against bright stars at kiloparsec distances across the infrared spectrum. Here we present an overview of the project `Webb Investigation of Silicates, Carbons, and Ices' (WISCI) along with interpretation of two targets, GSC 08152-02121 and CPD-59 5831. Observations of 12 WISCI target stars were taken by JWST, the Hubble Space Telescope, Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We use these to characterize the targets' spectral types and calculate their line-of-sight extinction parameters, $A_{\rm V}$ and $R_{\rm V}$. We find absorption in the JWST spectra of GSC 08152-02121, and CPD-59 5831 associated with carbonaceous dust around 3.4 and 6.2 micron and amorphous silicates at 9.7 micron. In GSC 08152-02121 we also find indications of absorption by trapped water around 3 micron. This first look from WISCI demonstrates the line-of-sight variability within the sample, and the program's potential to identify and correlate features across ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a sample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak luminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity function and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest systematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a volume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16 low-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \geq -16$ mag. We find that plateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing positive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density profiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a weak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One SN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of >3.5 mag, consistent with an electron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive explosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using semi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on radiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low nickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), low explosion energies (0.1-0.28 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}_{-1.7}$ $\mathrm{M\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$. In comparison, the full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\times 10^{51}$ erg), ejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness, explosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We conclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP population and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Red clump (RC) stars are reliable standard candles for studying the structure and evolution of the Milky Way. In this study, we present empirical calibrations of RC absolute magnitudes in the Mephisto (v, g, r, i) and CSST (g, r, i) photometric systems using a high-purity sample of 25,059 RC stars cross-matched between APOGEE and Gaia DR3 XP spectra. Through synthetic photometry and polynomial fitting, we find that RC absolute magnitudes exhibit strong dependencies on effective temperature and metallicity, with the strongest variations observed in bluer bands and progressively decreasing towards redder wavelengths. In particular, the Mephisto v band exhibits the highest sensitivity, with variations reaching up to 2.0 mag across the metallicity range (-1.0 dex <[Fe/H] <0.5 dex) and the temperature range (4500-5200 K). The calibrations achieve high precision for all bands, enabling accurate determination of RC absolute magnitudes and distances. Furthermore, we evaluate the metallicity estimation capabilities of both systems using a Random Forest-based method, achieving a precision of 0.12 dex for Mephisto and 0.14 dex for CSST under typical photometric uncertainties (< 0.01 mag). These results provide robust tools for distance and metallicity determinations, supporting future Galactic structure studies with Mephisto and CSST data.
#### Evidence of Time-Dependent Diffusive Shock Acceleration in the 2022 September 5 Solar Energetic Particle Event

 - **Abstract**
 On 2022 September 5, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event was detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO), at heliocentric distances of 0.07 and 0.71 au, respectively. PSP observed an unusual velocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal velocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse velocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than those at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV upstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock. The arrival of SEPs at PSP was significantly delayed relative to the expected onset of the eruption. In contrast, SolO detected a typical large SEP event characterized by a regular velocity dispersion at all energies up to 100 MeV. To understand these features, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the observers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan Solver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse velocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the time-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage, PSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near perihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward. Conversely, SolO maintained a stable magnetic connection to the strong shock region where efficient acceleration was achieved. These results underscore the importance of spatial and temporal dependence in SEP acceleration at interplanetary shocks, and provide new insights to understand SEP variations in the inner heliosphere.
#### Water vapour masers in long-period variable stars IV. Mira variables RCas, oCet and RLeo

 - **Abstract**
 Between 1987 and 2023 we carried out single-dish monitoring campaigns of water-maser emission at 22 GHz in the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of four stars: RCas, oCet, RLeo and ChiCyg. The variability in integrated flux in RCas and oCet followed that in the optical with the same period, but with a lag of about one-third in phase. RLeo was too often below our sensitivity threshold for us to determine a radio period. No maser was detected in ChiCyg. The variability in the masers in RCas has a distinctive pattern that confirms the existence of a zone in the CSE with favourable conditions for maser excitation. The total flux, modulated by the pulsations of the star, gradually increases to a maximum, which is followed by a similar decrease. This takes about 20 years. The pattern is repeated after an interval of quiescence of several years. During its decline, the variation in the flux resembles a damped harmonic oscillator. There are two dominant emission components that move almost tangentially on either side of the star with respect to the observer. The redshifted one is consistent with an origin in a single cloud that lived for at least about eight years, falling back towards the star. The blue component, moving in the CSE hemisphere nearest to us, has no drift in the line-of-sight velocity and appears to originate in a time series of short-living clouds with line-of-sight velocities within ca. 1 km/s of each other. No systematic drifts are found in RLeo and oCet. A few bursts of emission were detected in RCas and RLeo that lasted about a year and caused an increase in the flux density by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The velocity range of the maser emission is < 10 km/s and is clearly correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars influence Galactic lithium evolution by ejecting surface material (including Li) via stellar winds. Internal gravity waves (IGW), excited by convective motions, drive turbulent mixing in non-convective regions, altering stellar surface and wind chemistry. Aims: Investigate IGW-induced extra-mixing in the radiative zone between thermal pulses and convective envelopes of AGB stars and its impact on Li production. Derive the total Li contribution from intermediate-mass AGB stars using stellar models and initial mass functions. Methods: Construct stellar models (from zero-age main sequence to AGB end) with MESA, incorporating IGW-induced mixing and element diffusion. Calculate Li yields for stars of varying masses and metallicities using grids and population synthesis. Results: IGW triggers extra-mixing during He-shell flashes, transporting Be-7 from the radiative zone to the convective envelope, where it decays into Li-7. The positive effect of IGW on Li yield decreases with initial stellar mass but increases with metallicity. Most AGB stars (3.5-7.5 solar masses) produce positive Li yields. The total Li yield with IGW mixing (approximately 15 solar masses) is twice that without, contributing about 10 percent to Galactic Li. Conclusions: Through this extra-mixing mechanism induced by IGW, AGB stars can achieve a maximum A(Li) exceeding 5 and intermediate-mass AGB stars significantly contribute to Li in the Galactic ISM. These findings underscore the crucial role of IGW in stellar evolution, particularly in enhancing Li production.
#### JWST Observations of Photo-dissociation Regions. II. Aliphatic/Aromatic Carbonaceous Dust, Ices, and Gas Phase Spectral Line Inventory

 - **Abstract**
 This paper provides an overview of the spectroscopic data obtained by the JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program 1192, "The Physics and Chemistry of PDR Fronts", including an inventory of the spatially resolved dust, gas, and molecular content in the Horsehead nebula and the NW filament of NGC~7023. We demonstrate the unique capability of this high spatial resolution data set to elucidate the evolution of gas and dust at the interface between stars and their natal clouds at the scale at which the physics and chemistry occur. The Disassociation Regions (PDRs) in the Horsehead nebula and the North West (NW) filament of NGC 7023 were mapped with a spectral resolution 1000-3000 and a spatial resolution of ~2e-4 pc between 0.97-28um. Spectra extracted from template regions yield a large number of atomic, ionized, and molecular lines. Full line lists and extracted spectra for all 10 regions are provided through CDS. Absorption from H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices are identified in 3 regions in NGC 7023. In this overview, we have focused on the spectral region between 3 and 5 um which is dominated by emission from aromatic and aliphatic carbon bonds to illustrate the power of the data set. We confirm the entrainment of aromatic carbonaceous species in the photo-evaporative flow from the PDR surface into the H\,{\sc{ii}} region in the Horsehead. No aliphatic emission is present in the outflow, indicating the complete removal of aliphatic bonds when exposed to strong UV fields. There is a clear detection of deuterium substitution in the carbon bonds. Aliphatic D-substitution is more efficient relative to aromatic D-substitution, ranging from N$_{D}$/N$_{H}$ ~ 0.1-0.3 for aliphatics compared to ~0.03 for the aromatics.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyzing filaments and cores in molecular clouds is key to understanding galactic star formation and its environmental dependence. This paper studies the properties and distribution of dense cores and filaments in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with a focus on the L1688 hub-filament system (HFS) and its star formation potential. We extracted sources and filaments from Herschel images and a 13.5 arcsec resolution surface density map using the getsf method, identified prestellar cores among the extracted sources, evaluated core mass segregation, and constructed the core mass function (CMF). We derived properties of the filaments from their radial surface density profiles, constructed the filament linear density function (FLDF), and assessed the mass distribution in the L1688 HFS to estimate the core and filament formation efficiencies (CFE, FFE). The results suggest that the filament-dominated core formation is a key mechanism in star formation within the system.
