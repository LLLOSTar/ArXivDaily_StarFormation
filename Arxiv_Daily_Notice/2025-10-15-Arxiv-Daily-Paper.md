 - **Abstract**
 Binary systems of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are one of the most promising candidates for the progenitor systems of Type Ia supernovae. Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically. However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves. Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation. We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object. The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs. We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$. Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is dedicated to the study of the luminous blue variable (LBV) Var 2 in the galaxy M33, which is currently in a "dormant" state and is observed as an Of/late-WN star. We had calculated self-consistent hydrodynamic non-LTE models of the extended atmosphere, taking into account the balance of radial forces in the wind of the star. This allowed us to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of Var 2. The derived luminosity ($L=6.5\times10^{5}\,L_\odot$), current mass ($M_* \approx23\,M_\odot$) and hydrogen abundance on the surface (${\rm X}_{\rm H}\approx43\%$) correspond well to a star with the initial mass $M_{\rm init}\approx50\,M_\odot$ and age $t_{\rm age}\approx5.0\times10^6\,$years that is evolving from lower temperatures towards the Wolf-Rayet stars. A study of dynamic properties of the wind showed that the shape of the wind velocity profile of the Var 2 is close to the one of OB supergiants. In contrast, for the obtained mass loss rate $\dot{M}=2.1\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, the ratio of the wind momentum to the luminosity of Var 2 is in good agreement with the values found for late-WN stars. At the same time, Var 2 has a lower terminal wind velocity $v_\infty\approx230\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ compared to typical early-type supergiants or late-WN stars. Given the obtained age estimates, Var 2 could potentially have been ejected from the cluster associated with the nearest large star-forming region located at a distance of $\sim100\,$pc. However, statistical analysis of the projected distribution of stars in the vicinity of Var 2 suggests that this LBV could have formed in a local low-populated group.

 - **Abstract**
 The attracting properties of gravity enable matter present in cores to collapse into stars with seven orders of magnitude change in space and time making modelling of star formation a challenging multi-scale process. To circumvent this scale problem stars are replaced by a sub-grid sink particle at a much larger scale. Sink particles are created above a threshold density and acquire mass and momentum through accretion. In models where binary star systems form and migrate to separations of a few cells, the accretion flow is unresolved and the relative accretion rate to the sink particles may become inaccurate. We introduce a new recipe for accretion onto binary sink particles that have overlapping accretion regions and implement an algorithm to track the angular momentum of sink particles as a proxy for the stellar spin. Our preferential binary accretion recipe uses a virtual binary sink particle for the purpose of accretion and redistribute the accreted mass onto the sink particles according to results from models investigating binary accretion in detail. This solves problems common to current algorithms in many codes: (i) accretion is not suppressed due to large velocity differences between gas and stars, when that velocity is only internal to the binary system, (ii) the accretion rates are smoother for the unresolved close binaries in eccentric orbits, and (iii) non-physical suppression of accretion onto the secondary sink particle when the primary dominates the potential is eliminated. We test our implementation by comparing simulations at increasing resolution until the binaries are resolved. While not perfect, it mitigates undesired properties of current algorithms and in particularly for global models of starforming regions. It may also be applied to other unresolved accreting binaries, such as compact objects in clusters and binary supermassive black holes in cosmological models.
#### Hubble reveals complex multi-scale structure in the edge-on protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution (<0.1") Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of the near edge-on (i~80 deg) protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707 ("Dracula's Chivito") obtained across six broadband filters spanning 0.4-1.6 microns. These observations unveil the scattered light from this unusually large disk (~14", or ~4200 au at 300 pc) in remarkable detail, revealing a rich tapestry of substructure, including brightness asymmetries and signatures of dynamical activity. Extended filaments are detected extending ~10" from the northern edges of both nebulae, while no comparable southern features are observed. In addition to large-scale asymmetries, the disk exhibits prominent wispy features that extend well above the midplane and are visible in all filters, suggesting a complex, possibly turbulent outer disk atmosphere shaped by infall, dynamical stirring, or gravitational instability. The central dark lane narrows from optical to near-IR wavelengths, and high-resolution millimeter data reveal compact midplane emission. Although our radiative transfer simulations show that the current data cannot yet distinguish between dust-settling and no-settling scenarios, they underscore the need for deeper observations of this unique system. IRAS 23077+6707 thus represents a rare and valuable laboratory for studying the vertical structure, asymmetries, and evolutionary state of protoplanetary disks.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of wide, eccentric Gaia neutron stars (NSs) in binaries with still evolving (likely main sequence) companions offers a new probe of mass transfer and pulsar recycling beyond the compact-binary regime. We model their origins and fates using population synthesis with POSYDON and detailed binary evolution with MESA, contrasting two limiting prescriptions at Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF): enforced circularization versus explicitly eccentric mass transfer. Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric, non-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and neutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under optimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only <1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers remain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic populations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling, whereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable mass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington rate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the Eddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer instead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can climb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric channel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild recycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular NS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary obliquity (axial tilt) plays an important role in regulating the climate evolution and habitability of water-covered planets. Despite the suspicion of large obliquities in several exoplanetary systems, this phenomenon remains hard to observe directly. We aimed to study the effect of mass, obliquity, and rotation on the steady state climate of water-covered planets. We simulated the climate evolution of such planets with varying obliquities, rotational speed, and mass using a general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, assuming aqua-planet configurations. High obliquity supports an asymmetry between the equilibrium climatological conditions in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar temperature ratio deviates further from unity with increasing obliquity and rotation rate. Cloud coverage patterns also shift with obliquity, displaying distinct latitudinal bands and increased cloudiness in the warmer hemisphere. The climate of habitable-zone aqua-planets turns out to be sensitive to changes in obliquity and rotation rate, but are independent of planet mass. Our results highlight the importance of considering these factors when assessing the surface conditions of exoplanets. As a consequence, surface condition asymmetries in water-world exo-planets can be used to infer the planet's obliquity and rotation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars (>8 $M_{\odot}$) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the UV/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN-CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT. We then discuss the prospects for multi-messenger observations of such events in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 Bow shocks generated from the interaction of winds from massive runaway stars with the interstellar medium have been shown to be prominent particle accelerators through recent $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron observations. Here, we study particle acceleration from bow shocks by conducting 3D ideal cosmic ray magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the advection-diffusion limit. We use the Eulerian grid-based code FLASH, where stellar winds are injected through tabulated wind velocities and mass loss rates. We implement a gradient-based shock detection algorithm to resolve the shocked regions where the CRs are injected dynamically. Simulations are performed for different values of the CR diffusion coefficient and star velocities within an ISM-like environment up to 180 kyr to showcase the impact of dynamical CR injection on the early evolution of the wind-driven bow shock. With a simplified spectral model in post-processing, we calculate the expected upper limits of $\gamma$-ray and synchrotron emission and compare with those from current observations. We observe that variations of CR diffusion rates can strongly dictate the morphology of the bow shock and the overall $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron luminosity due to the balance between the CR injection efficiency and diffusion. Our results yield qualitatively comparable results with current observations, primarily attributed to the high-energy protons and electrons contributing to non-thermal emission from efficient acceleration at the forward shock through the approximations and assumptions in the injection algorithm. We conclude that CR acceleration, with varying CR diffusion rates, may substantially affect the morphology of wind-driven bow shocks and their non-thermal emission, if there is efficient particle acceleration in the forward shock.

 - **Abstract**
 The decay of Short-Lived Radioisotopes (SLRs) can be a significant source of heating early in protoplanetary systems, though how a protoplanetary disk becomes enriched with these SLRs far above the galactic background level remains an open question. Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment occurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a protoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary system. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through interaction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt disks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not form at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB ``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through star-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to WR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers on star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the enrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous N-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment is widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time at which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a factor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many disks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the interloper is more evolved.

 - **Abstract**
 Image reconstruction in very-long baseline interferometry operates under severely sparse aperture coverage with calibration challenges from both the participating instruments and propagation medium, which introduce the risk of biases and artefacts. Interferometric closure invariants offers calibration-independent information on the true source morphology, but the inverse transformation from closure invariants to the source intensity distribution is an ill-posed problem. In this work, we present a generative deep learning approach to tackle the inverse problem of directly reconstructing images from their observed closure invariants. Trained in a supervised manner with simple shapes and the CIFAR-10 dataset, the resulting trained model achieves reduced chi-square data adherence scores of $\chi^2_{\rm CI} \lesssim 1$ and maximum normalised cross-correlation image fidelity scores of $\rho_{\rm NX} > 0.9$ on tests of both trained and untrained morphologies, where $\rho_{\rm NX}=1$ denotes a perfect reconstruction. We also adapt our model for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope total intensity analysis challenge. Our results on quantitative metrics are competitive to other state-of-the-art image reconstruction algorithms. As an algorithm that does not require finely hand-tuned hyperparameters, this method offers a relatively simple and reproducible calibration-independent imaging solution for very-long baseline interferometry, which ultimately enhances the reliability of sparse VLBI imaging results.

 - **Abstract**
 Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle -- which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field -- are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.
#### Violent mergers can explain the inflated state of some of the fastest stars in the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 A significant number of hypervelocity stars with velocities between $1500-2500$ km/s have recently been observed. The only plausible explanation so far is that they have been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Since these stars are thought to be surviving donors of Type Ia supernovae, a surprising finding was that these stars are inflated, with radii an order of magnitude more than expected for Roche-lobe filling donors. Recent attempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain the impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the hottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be reproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions. In this and a companion paper, we introduce a new \textsc{Arepo} simulation of two massive CO white dwarfs that explode via a violent merger. There, the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary is on its last orbit and plunging towards the primary. In the corresponding aftermath, the core of the secondary white dwarf of 0.16 M$_\odot$, remains bound, moving at a velocity of $\sim2800$ km/s. We map this object into MESA, and show that this runaway star can explain the observations of two hypervelocity stars that were dubbed D6-1 and D6-3 based on their original discovery motivated by the D6 scenario, though the violent merger scenario presented here is somewhat distinct from the D6 scenario.

 We review recent advances in the numerical modeling of turbulent flows and star formation. An overview of the most widely used simulation codes and their core capabilities is provided. We then examine methods for achieving the highest-resolution magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations to date, highlighting challenges related to numerical viscosity and resistivity. State-of-the-art approaches to modeling gravity and star formation are discussed in detail, including implementations of star particles and feedback from jets, winds, heating, ionization, and supernovae. We review the latest techniques for radiation hydrodynamics, including ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and moment methods, with comparisons between the flux-limited diffusion, moment-1, and variable Eddington tensor methods. The final chapter summarizes advances in cosmic-ray transport schemes, emphasizing their growing importance for connecting small-scale star formation physics with galaxy-scale evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-domain studies of mid-infrared and submillimeter variability have shown that at least half of protostars are variable. We present a statistical analysis of mid-infrared variability among young stellar objects (YSOs) in the distant, massive star-forming region W51 using NEOWISE data. From a catalog of 81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless pre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant variability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance (~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to high-mass YSOs (>2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars. This mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars, 7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability, while 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions were found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward earlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely driven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more secular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion variations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars generally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or variable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in W1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot modulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across evolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key insight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer Resolve onboard the XRISM space telescope opened a new era for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of astrophysical plasmas. Many spectral features were newly detected, including the K alpha and K beta inner-shell transition lines of mildly ionized (F- to Li-like) Fe at 6-8 keV in the spectra of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The widely used atomic databases contain information on the K alpha but not K beta lines of these ions. We conducted the atomic structure calculation using FAC to derive the Fe K alpha and K beta lines and verified the result against ground experiments and other calculations of the Fe K alpha lines. We then implemented the Fe K beta lines in a radiative transfer code (cloudy) and compared the synthesized and observed spectra with XRISM. A reasonably good agreement was obtained between the observation and the ab initio calculations. This exemplifies the need to expand the atomic databases to interpret astrophysical spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets and outflows are key components of low-mass star formation, regulating accretion and shaping the surrounding molecular clouds. These flows, traced by molecular species at (sub)millimeter wavelengths (e.g., CO, SiO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) and by atomic, ionized, and molecular lines in the infrared (e.g., H$_2$, [Fe II], [S I]), originate from protostellar accretion disks deeply embedded within dusty envelopes. Jets play a crucial role in removing angular momentum from the disk, thereby enabling continued mass accretion, while directly preserving a record of the protostar's outflow history and potentially providing indirect insights into its accretion history. Recent advances in high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the infrared and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, have revolutionized studies of protostellar jets and outflows. These instruments provide complementary views of warm, shock-excited gas and cold molecular component of the jet-outflow system. In this review, we discuss the current status of observational studies that reveal detailed structures, kinematics, and chemical compositions of protostellar jets and outflows. Recent analyses of mass-loss rates, velocities, rotation, molecular abundances, and magnetic fields provide critical insights into jet launching mechanisms, disk evolution, and the potential formation of binary systems and planets. The synergy of JWST's infrared sensitivity and ALMA's high-resolution imaging is advancing our understanding of jets and outflows. Future large-scale, high-resolution surveys with these facilities are expected to drive major breakthroughs in outflow research.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of 1.28 GHz radio filaments observed by MeerKAT over the innermost 200 pc of the Galaxy (roughly $\pm 1.5°$), which includes the central molecular zone (CMZ). The catalog is generated by repurposing software developed for the automated detection of filaments in solar coronal loops. There are two parts to the catalog. The first part, the main catalog, provides a point-by-point listing of locations and basic observational properties along each detected filament. The second part is a summary catalog which provides a listing of mean, median, or total values of various properties for each filament. Tabulated quantities include position, length, curvature, brightness, and spectral index. The catalogs contain a heterogeneous mix of filamentary structures, including nonthermal radio filaments (NRFs), and parts of supernova remnants (SNRs) and thermally emitting regions (e.g. H II regions). We discuss criteria for selecting useful subsamples of filaments from the catalogs, and some of the details encountered in examining filaments or selections of filaments from the catalogs.

Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (>400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have recently regained interest as PeVatron candidates, potentially accounting for the cosmic-ray (CR) knee as alternatives to isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). LHAASO's unique capability to detect photons above 0.1 PeV, hence tracing multi-PeV CRs, can provide critical constraints on galactic acceleration models when combined with H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT data. We investigate the transport of particles from YMSCs acceleration sites, namely wind termination shocks (WTS) or embedded SNRs, to nearby dense molecular clouds where proton-proton interactions produce high-energy gamma rays. We determine the necessary conditions, such as the distance between the acceleration site and the target, or the cluster's power and age, for detectable gamma-ray excesses and identify viable systems through parameter space exploration. By comparing with observations, we can constrain key physical parameters including WTS efficiency, diffusion coefficient and injection slope. Our analysis also examines whether some of LHAASO's unidentified sources might correspond to such cluster-cloud systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}> 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}>10^5$~G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($<0.5$~au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.
