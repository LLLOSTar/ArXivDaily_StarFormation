 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) are stellar remnants moving at speeds exceeding the Milky Way's escape velocity. The origins of the fastest HVWDs are enigmatic, with proposed formation scenarios facing challenges explaining both their extreme velocities and observed properties. Here we report a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a merger between two hybrid helium-carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (HeCO WDs with masses of 0.68 and 0.62 M$_\odot$). We find that the merger leads to a partial disruption of the secondary WD, coupled with a double-detonation explosion of the primary WD. This launches the remnant core of the secondary WD at a speed of $~2000$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with observed HVWDs. The low mass of the ejected remnant and its heating from the primary WD's ejecta explain the observed luminosities and temperatures of hot HVWDs, which are otherwise difficult to reconcile with previous models. This discovery establishes a new formation channel for HVWDs and points to a previously unrecognized pathway for producing peculiar Type Ia supernovae and faint explosive transients.

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability (SI) is a leading mechanism for concentrating solid particles into regions dense enough to form planetesimals. Its efficiency in clumping particles depends primarily on the dimensionless stopping time ($\tau_s$, a proxy for particle size) and dust-to-gas surface density ratio ($Z$). Previous simulations identified a critical $Z$ ($Z_{\rm{crit}}$) above which strong clumping occurs, where particle densities exceed the Hill density (thus satisfying a condition for gravitational collapse), over a wide range of $\tau_s$. These works found that for $\tau_s \leq 0.01$, $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ was above the ISM value $(\sim 0.01)$. In this work, we reexamine the clumping threshold using 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations at high resolution and with relatively large (compared to many previous simulations) domain sizes. Our main results are as follows: First, when $\tau_s = 0.01$, strong clumping occurs even at $Z \lesssim 0.01$, lower than $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ found in all previous studies. Consequently, we revise a previously published fit to the $Z_{\rm{crit}}$ curve to account for this updated $Z_{\rm{crit}}$. Second, higher resolution results in a thicker dust layer, which may result from other instabilities manifesting, such as the vertical shearing streaming instability. Third, despite this thicker layer, higher resolution can lead to strong clumping even with lower midplane dust-to-gas density ratios (which results from the thicker particle layer) so long as $Z \gtrsim Z_{\rm{crit}}$. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the SI in clumping small particles at $Z \sim 0.01$, which is a significant refinement of the conditions for planetesimal formation by the SI.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest concentration of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy, the structure of which is shaped by the complex interplay between Galactic-scale dynamics and extreme physical conditions. Understanding the 3-D geometry of this gas is crucial as it determines the locations of star formation and subsequent feedback. We present a catalogue of clouds in the CMZ using Herschel data. Using archival data from the APEX and MOPRA CMZ surveys, we measure averaged kinematic properties of the clouds at 1mm and 3mm. We use archival ATCA data of the H$_{2}$CO (1$_{1,0}$ - 1$_{1,1}$) 4.8 GHz line to search for absorption towards the clouds, and 4.85 GHz GBT C-band data to measure the radio continuum emission. We measure the absorption against the continuum to provide new constraints for the line-of-sight positions of the clouds relative to the Galactic centre, and find a highly asymmetric distribution, with most clouds residing in front of the Galactic centre. The results are compared with different orbital models, and we introduce a revised toy model of a vertically-oscillating closed elliptical orbit. We find that most models describe the PPV structure of the gas reasonably well, but find significant inconsistencies in all cases regarding the near vs. far placement of individual clouds. Our results highlight that the CMZ is likely more complex than can be captured by these simple geometric models, along with the need for new data to provide further constraints on the true 3-D structure of the CMZ.
#### 3-D CMZ IV: Distinguishing Near vs. Far Distances in the Galactic Center Using Spitzer and Herschel

 - **Abstract**
 A comprehensive 3-D model of the central 300 pc of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is of fundamental importance in understanding energy cycles in galactic nuclei, since the 3-D structure influences the location and intensity of star formation, feedback, and black hole accretion. Current observational constraints are insufficient to distinguish between existing 3-D models. Dust extinction is one diagnostic tool that can help determine the location of dark molecular clouds relative to the bright Galactic Center emission. By combining Herschel and Spitzer observations, we developed three new dust extinction techniques to estimate the likely near/far locations for each cloud in the CMZ. We compare our results to four geometric CMZ orbital models. Our extinction methods show good agreement with each other, and with results from spectral line absorption analysis from Walker et al. (submitted). Our near/far results for CMZ clouds are inconsistent with a projected version of the Sofue (1995) two spiral arms model, and show disagreement in position-velocity space with the Molinari et al. (2011) closed elliptical orbit. Our results are in reasonable agreement with the Kruijssen et al. (2015) open streams. We find that a simplified toy-model elliptical orbit which conserves angular momentum shows promising fits in both position-position and position-velocity space. We conclude that all current CMZ orbital models lack the complexity needed to describe the motion of gas in the CMZ, and further work is needed to construct a complex orbital model to accurately describe gas flows in the CMZ.
#### Using the Ca II lines in T Tauri stars to infer the abundance of refractory elements in the innermost disk regions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the abundance of calcium in the innermost disk of 70 T Tauri stars in the star-forming regions of Chamaeleon I, Lupus and Orion OB1b. We use calcium as a proxy for the refractory material that reaches the inner disk. We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca II emission lines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed from the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming regions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] < -0.30 relative to the solar abundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion, consistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca depletion ([Ca/H] < -0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some of those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no correlation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the mass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer disks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass reservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in the outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our results of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively consistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift including partitioning of elements and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of solids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.
#### 3-D CMZ I: Central Molecular Zone Overview

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40°($|l| <$ 20°) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $> 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40°($|l| <$ 20°) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8°$> \ell >$ -1.3°. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT.

 - **Abstract**
 Clustered stellar feedback creates expanding voids in the magnetized interstellar medium known as superbubbles. Although theory suggests that superbubble expansion is influenced by interstellar magnetic fields, direct observational data on 3D superbubble magnetic field geometry is limited. The Sun's location inside the Local Bubble provides a unique opportunity to infer a superbubble's 3D magnetic field orientation, under the assumptions that: $\mathrm{I}$) the Local Bubble's surface is the primary contributor to plane-of-the-sky polarization observations across much of the sky, and $\mathrm{II}$) the Local Bubble's magnetic field is tangent to its dust-traced shell. In this work, we validate these assumptions and construct a model of the Local Bubble's 3D B-field orientation from $\textit{Planck}$ 353 GHz polarization observations and a 3D-dust-derived model of the Local Bubble's shell. We test Assumption $\mathrm{I}$ by examining correlations between the Local Bubble's 3D geometry, dust polarization, and starlight polarization. We find that the Local Bubble likely dominates the polarized signal in the majority of lines of sight. We jointly test Assumptions $\mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{II}$ by applying our reconstruction method to a simulated superbubble, where we successfully reconstruct the 3D magnetic field orientation over the bulk of its surface. Finally, we use our 3D B-field model to infer the initial magnetic field orientation in the solar neighborhood prior to the Local Bubble's formation, and derive an orientation parallel to the present-day Local Arm of the galaxy. These findings provide new insights into the co-evolution of superbubbles and the magnetized interstellar medium.
#### Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089: I. Multi-Wavelength Variability

 - **Abstract**
 The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars in $\gamma$-rays, exhibiting phases of very high activity. This study investigates its variability over a decade across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Utilizing the non-thermal dominance parameter, we analyze the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and $\lambda5100\text{ Å}$ continuum light curves to discern the primary source of continuum emission, either from the accretion disk or the jet, during different activity phases. Our findings underscore the dominance of jet emission in the continuum during flare-like events. We observed an approximately 80-day delay between the H$\beta$ and continuum emissions, which we attribute to the spatial separation between the optical emission zone and the broad-line region. Near-zero delays between optical and near-infrared emissions suggest that the emitting regions within the jet are co-spatial. Synchrotron self-Compton was identified as the primary mechanism for $\gamma$-ray emission during flares, supported by the minimal delay observed between optical/near-infrared emissions and $\gamma$-rays. Additionally, we found a delay of about 60 days between the leading optical/near-infrared emissions and X-rays, indicating that inverse Compton scattering within the jet predominantly drives X-ray emission. However, distinguishing between synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse Compton mechanism was not feasible. Shifts in the spectral index across the 15-230 GHz range corresponded with ejections from the radio core, suggesting changes in the physical conditions of the jet.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraviolet wavelengths offer unique insights into aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. However, only a handful of exoplanets have been observed in the ultraviolet to date. Here, we present the ultraviolet-visible transmission spectrum of the inflated hot Jupiter WASP-127b. We observed one transit of WASP-127b with WFC3/UVIS G280 as part of the Hubble Ultraviolet-optical Survey of Transiting Legacy Exoplanets (HUSTLE), obtaining a transmission spectrum from 200-800 nm. Our reductions yielded a broad-band transit depth precision of 91 ppm and a median precision of 240 ppm across 59 spectral channels. Our observations are suggestive of a high-altitude cloud layer with forward modeling showing they are composed of sub-micron particles and retrievals indicating a high opacity patchy cloud. While our UVIS/G280 data only offers weak evidence for Na, adding archival HST WFC3/IR and STIS observations raises the overall Na detection significance to 4.1-sigma. Our work demonstrates the capabilities of HST WFC3/UVIS G280 observations to probe the aerosols and atmospheric composition of transiting hot Jupiters with comparable precision to HST STIS.
#### ATOMS: ALMA three-millimeter observations of massive star-forming regions -- XVIII. On the origin and evolution of dense gas fragments in molecular shells of compact HII regions

 - **Abstract**
 Fragmentation and evolution for the molecular shells of the compact HII regions are less explored compared to their evolved counterparts. We map nine compact HII regions with a typical diameter of 0.4 pc that are surrounded by molecular shells traced by CCH. Several to a dozen dense gas fragments probed by H13CO+ are embedded in these molecular shells. These gas fragments, strongly affected by the HII region, have a higher surface density, mass, and turbulence than those outside the shells but within the same pc-scale natal clump. These features suggest that the shells swept up by the early HII regions can enhance the formation of massive dense structures that may host the birth of higher-mass stars. We examine the formation of fragments and find that fragmentation of the swept-up shell is unlikely to occur in these early HII regions, by comparing the expected time scale of shell fragmentation with the age of HII region. We propose that the appearance of gas fragments in these shells is probably the result of sweeping up pre-existing fragments into the molecular shell that has not yet fragmented. Taken together, this work provides a basis for understanding the interplay of star-forming sites with an intricate environment containing ionization feedback such as those observed in starburst regions.
#### Multi-messenger signature of cosmic rays from the microquasar V4641 Sgr propagating along a Galactic Magnetic Field line

 - **Abstract**
 The recently detected extended, very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the microquasar V4641 Sgr reveals a puzzling 200-parsec-long jet-like structure significantly misaligned with its radio jet. We propose that this gamma-ray structure is produced by high-energy cosmic-ray particles escaping from the microquasar along ordered field lines of the Galactic Magnetic Field and interacting with the interstellar medium. We show that if the gamma-ray emission is produced by interactions of high-energy cosmic ray nuclei, the system is detectable by future multi-km3 neutrino detectors. We argue that gamma-ray observations of jet-like features adjacent to high-energy sources in the Milky Way provide a new method to measure the regular and turbulent components of the Galactic magnetic field at different locations in the Milky Way.

 In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available forimmediate this http URL mostnovelfeature ofProGeny is itsabilitytoproduce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions, allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertaintiesand corrections forstarformationrates andstellar massesare alsopresented.
#### Constraining the CSM structure and progenitor mass-loss history of interacting supernovae through 3D hydrodynamic modeling: The case of SN 2014C

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate SN 2014C using three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, focusing on its early interaction with dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Our objective is to uncover the pre-supernova (SN) CSM structure and constrain the progenitor star's mass-loss history prior to core collapse. Our comprehensive model traces the evolution from the progenitor star through the SN event and into the SN remnant (SNR) phase. We simulate the remnant's expansion over approximately 15 years, incorporating a CSM derived from the progenitor star's outflows through dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Analysis reveals that the remnant interacted with a dense toroidal nebula extending from $4.3\times 10^{16}\,$cm to $1.5\times 10^{17}$ cm in the equatorial plane, with a thickness of approximately $1.2\times 10^{17}$ cm. The nebula's density peaks at approximately $3\times 10^6\,$cm$^{-3}$ at the inner boundary, gradually decreasing as $\approx r^{-2}$ at greater distances. This nebula formed due to intense mass-loss from the progenitor star between approximately 5000 and 1000 years before collapse. During this period, the maximum mass-loss rate reached about $8\times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$, ejecting $\approx 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ of stellar material into the CSM. Our model accurately reproduces Chandra and NuSTAR spectra, including the Fe K line, throughout the remnant's evolution. Notably, the Fe line is self-consistently reproduced, originating from shocked ejecta, with $\approx 0.05\,M_{\odot}$ of pure-Fe ejecta shocked during the remnant-nebula interaction. These findings suggest that the 3D geometry and density distribution of the CSM, as well as the progenitor star's mass-loss history, align with a scenario where the star was stripped through binary interaction, specifically common envelope evolution.
#### Under the magnifying glass: A combined 3D model applied to cloudy warm Saturn type exoplanets around M-dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Warm Saturn type exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs are particularly suitable for in-depth cloud characterisation through transmission spectroscopy due to their favourable stellar to planetary radius contrast. However, modelling cloud formation consistently within the 3D atmosphere remains computationally challenging. The aim is to explore the combined atmospheric and micro-physical cloud structure, and the kinetic gas-phase chemistry for the warm Saturn HATS0-6b orbiting an M-dwarf. A combined 3D cloudy atmosphere model is constructed by iteratively executing the 3D General Circulation Model (GCM) expeRT/MITgcm and a kinetic cloud formation model, each in its full complexity. Resulting cloud particle number densities, sizes, and compositions are used to derive the local cloud opacity which is then utilised in the next GCM iteration. The disequilibrium H/C/O/N gas-phase chemistry is calculated for each iteration to assess the resulting transmission spectrum in post-processing. The cloud opacity feedback causes a temperature inversion at the sub-stellar point and at the evening terminator at gas pressures higher than 0.01 bar. Furthermore, clouds cool the atmosphere between 0.01 bar and 10 bar, and narrow the equatorial wind jet. The transmission spectrum shows muted gas-phase absorption and a cloud particle silicate feature at approximately 10 micron. The combined atmosphere-cloud model retains the full physical complexity of each component and therefore enables a detailed physical interpretation with JWST NIRSpec and MIRI LRS observational accuracy. The model shows that warm Saturn type exoplanets around M-dwarfs are ideal candidates to search for limb asymmetries in clouds and chemistry, identify cloud particle composition by observing their spectral features, and identify the cloud-induced strong thermal inversion that arises on these planets specifically.

 - **Abstract**
 II Zw 40 is a starburst dwarf and merger product, and holds a radio-infrared supernebula excited by thousands of embedded OB stars. We present here observations of three aspects of the supernebula: maps of the K and KU radio continuum that trace dense ionized gas with spatial resolution $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$, a spectral data cube of the [S IV]$10.5\mu$m emission line that measures the kinematics of the ionized gas with velocity resolution $4.5$ km s$^{-1}$, and an ALMA spectral cube of the CO(3-2) line that probes the dense warm molecular gas with spatial and velocity resolution comparable to the ionized gas. The observations suggest that the supernebula is the overlap,collision or merger of two star clusters, each associated with an elongated molecular cloud. We accordingly modelled the supernebula with simulations of colliding clusters. The model that best agrees with the data is a grazing collision that has distorted the gas and stars to create the distinctive structures observed. These models may have wide applicability in the cluster-rich regions of young starbursts.
#### Radio sensitivity to a new population of millisecond pulsars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Observations with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveal an excess of extended gamma-ray emission likely caused by an undiscovered population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). However, additional evidence, such as multi-wavelength searches, is necessary to confirm this theory. A significant discovery could be made if radio pulsations from individual MSPs in the Sgr dSph are detected. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting MSPs in the Sgr dSph with present and upcoming radio surveys using a phenomenological model based on the observed luminosity function of MSPs in the Milky Way's globular clusters. Our findings suggest that the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is the most sensitive instrument for detecting these objects. We demonstrate that to observe one MSP with MeerKAT, we would need to perform a pointing observation of the core region of the Sgr dSph for about two hours. In this same observation time, SKA can identify $9^{+5}_{-3}$ MSPs in the entire system. Based on the distance of the Sgr dSph galaxy and our dispersion measure distance estimate, we find it possible to differentiate between MSPs belonging to the Sgr dSph and those of the Galactic disk and bulge. Furthermore, the MSPs hypothesis for the Sgr dSph gamma-ray excess could be confirmed at the 99.7\% confidence level by detecting at least six MSPs in a two-hour SKA observation of the Sgr dSph.

 - **Abstract**
 The composition of rocky planets is strongly driven by the primordial materials in the protoplanetary disk, which can be inferred from the abundances of the host star. Understanding this compositional link is crucial for characterizing exoplanets. We aim to investigate the relationship between the compositions of low-mass planets and their host stars. We determined the primordial compositions of host stars using high-precision present-day stellar abundances and stellar evolutionary models. These primordial abundances were then input into a stoichiometric model to estimate the composition of planet-building blocks. Additionally, we employed a three-component planetary interior model (core, mantle, water in different phases) to estimate planetary compositions based only on their radius and mass. We found that although stellar abundances vary over time, relevant abundance ratios like Fe/Mg remain relatively constant during the main sequence evolution for low temperature stars. A strong correlation is found between the iron-to-silicate mass fraction of protoplanetary disks and planets, while no significant correlation was observed for water mass fractions. The Fe/Mg ratio varies significantly between planets and their stars, indicating substantial disk-driven compositional diversity, and this ratio also correlates with planetary radius. While stellar abundances, as a proxy of the composition of protoplanetary disk, provide a baseline for planetary composition, significant deviations arise due to complex disk processes, challenging the assumption of a direct, one-to-one elemental relationship between stars and their planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Radially extended disk winds could be the key to unlocking how protoplanetary disks accrete and how planets form and migrate. A distinctive characteristic is their nested morphology of velocity and chemistry. Here we report JWST/NIRSpec spectro-imaging of four young stars with edge-on disks in the Taurus star-forming region that demonstrate the ubiquity of this structure. In each source, a fast collimated jet traced by [Fe II] is nested inside a hollow cavity within wider lower-velocity H2 and, in one case, also CO ro-vibrational (v=1-0) emission. Furthermore, in one of our sources, ALMA CO(2-1) emission, paired with our NIRSpec images, reveals the nested wind structure extends further outward. This nested wind morphology strongly supports theoretical predictions for wind-driven accretion and underscores the need for theoretical work to assess the role of winds in the formation and evolution of planetary systems

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the kinematics and star formation history of the Scorpius Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB association following the initial identification of sequential, linearly aligned chains of clusters. Building upon our characterization of the Corona Australis (CrA) chain, we now analyze two additional major cluster chains that exhibit similar characteristics: the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Scorpius (Upper Sco) chains. All three cluster chains display distinct sequential patterns in 1) the 3D spatial distribution, 2) age, 3) velocity, and 4) mass. The Upper-Sco chain is the most massive and complex cluster chain, possibly consisting of two or more overlapping subchains. We discuss the possible formation of cluster chains and argue for a scenario where feedback from the most massive star formation episode 15 Myr ago initiated the formation of these spatio-temporal cluster sequences. Our results identify cluster chains as a distinct type of stellar structure with well-defined physical properties, formed in environments capable of sustaining stellar feedback over timescales of 5-10 Myr. We find that around 40% of the stellar population in Sco-Cen formed due to triggered star formation, with 35% forming along the three cluster chains. We conclude that cluster chains could be common structures in OB associations, particularly in regions that have similar natal environments as Sco-Cen. Beyond their significance for star formation and stellar feedback, they appear to be promising laboratories for chemical enrichment and the transport of elements from one generation to the next in the same star-forming region.
