#### Seismic Oscillations Excited by Giant Impacts in Directly-Imaged Giant Planets

 - **Abstract**
 The radii and masses of many giant exoplanets imply their interiors each contain more than $\sim$100 $M_\oplus$ of solids. A large metal content may arise when a giant planet grows by colliding and merging with multiple $\sim$10 $M_\oplus$ solid cores. Here we show that a giant impact with a young gas giant excites long-lived seismic oscillations that can be detected photometrically. Mode lifetimes are close to the planet's Kelvin-Helmholtz time, a significant fraction of a young planet's age. Oscillation periods lie between tens of minutes to an hour, and variability amplitudes can exceed a percent for several million years. Beta Pictoris b is a young super-Jupiter known to be highly metal-enriched. If a Neptune-mass (17 $M_\oplus$) body impacted $\beta$ Pictoris b in the past $\sim$9--18 Myr, the planet could still be ringing with a percent-level photometric variability measurable with JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 As dark matter appears to comprise most of the Galactic mass, some of it may accumulate in the cores of stars, thereby making the Sun a laboratory for constraining various dark matter theories. We consider the effects on the solar structure arising from a general class of macroscopic dark matter candidates that include strange quark matter, compact dark objects, and others. We calibrate standard solar evolution models (i.e., models that reproduce the mass, luminosity, radius, and metallicity of the Sun at its present age) with variable compact dark core masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-2}~\rm{M}_\odot$ and assess their properties. We find that the weakest constraints come from solar neutrino flux measurements, which only rule out the most massive dark core comprising at least $\sim 1\%$ of the total solar mass. The Sun's acoustic oscillations impose stronger constraints, probing masses down to $\sim 10^{-5}~\rm{M}_\odot$. We find that a model with a $10^{-3}~\rm{M}_\odot$ dark core appears to improve the agreement with helioseismic observations. We nevertheless caution against interpreting this as evidence for dark matter in the solar interior, and suggest plausible effects that the dark core may instead be emulating. Finally, we show that future measurements of solar $g$~modes may constrain dark core masses down to $10^{-7}~\rm{M}_\odot$.
#### Very Late-Time JWST and Keck Spectra of the Oxygen-Rich Supernova 1995N

 - **Abstract**
 We present new {\it JWST}/MIRI MRS and Keck spectra of SN 1995N obtained in 2022--2023, more than 10,000 days after the supernova (SN) explosion. These spectra are among the latest direct detections of a core-collapse SN, both through emission lines in the optical and thermal continuum from infrared dust emission. The new infrared data show that dust heating from radiation produced by the ejecta interacting with circumstellar matter is still present, but greatly reduced from when SN 1995N was observed by the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} and {\it WISE} in 2009/2010 and 2018, when the dust mass was estimated to be 0.4 M(Sun). New radiative-transfer modeling suggests that the dust mass and grain size may have increased between 2010 and 2023. The new data can alternatively be well fit with a dust mass of 0.4 M(Sun) and a much reduced heating source luminosity. The new late-time spectra show unusually strong oxygen forbidden lines, stronger than the H-alpha emission. This indicates that SN 1995N may have exploded as a stripped-envelope SN which then interacted with a massive H-rich circumstellar shell, changing it from intrinsically Type Ib/c to Type IIn. The late-time spectrum results when the reverse shock begins to excite the inner H-poor, O-rich ejecta. This change in the spectrum is rarely seen, but marks the start of the transition from SN to SN remnant.
#### Hubble's Variable Nebula I: Ripples on a Big Screen

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01760

 - **Abstract**
 NGC2261 is a reflection nebula illuminated by the young star R Monocerotis. Objects moving near the star occasionally cast shadows on the nebula, giving rise to its alternative name: Hubble's Variable Nebula. For 7 years since Spring 2017 robotic telescopes have been used to compile a roughly twice-weekly record of changes in the object. The results, over 1000 images at separate epochs, have been compiled into a movie. This shows that, as well as the large scale but infrequent variability for which it is famous, the nebula is continually traversed by low level `ripples' of light and dark. These record changes in the light output from R Mon and analysis of their progress indicates that the reflecting material takes the form of a thin (<3x10^16cm) screen whose shape resembles a half paraboloid, rooted at the star and bowed towards us. The brightness of the screen in Herschel far-IR maps indicates a density n_H> 1.7x10^5cm^-3 and CO observations show the material is moving towards us at a few km/s relative to the rest cloud, consistent it with being a dense shell of material displaced by R~Mon's outflow. The results demonstrate the value of studying such objects in the time domain, and are a glimpse of what will be achieved by instruments like the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Observatory.
#### The impact of rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons on chemical composition of protoplanetary discs
 - **Authors:** L.N. Zwicky, T.S. Molyarova

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01844

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic rays and cosmic ray induced photons are vital components of chemical evolution in areas of interstellar medium that are impenetrable by external ultraviolet radiation. However, rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons used in astrochemical models were calculated for molecular clouds and can be different in protoplanetary discs, where dust grows up to larger sizes. Using ANDES astrochemical model, we study how an increase in both upper dust size and rates of reactions with cosmic ray induced photons can influence species abundances in protoplanetary discs. We show that the increase in these reactions' rates has a significant impact on the ice mass fraction in area between 2 and 20 au but has little impact on ionisation degree in disc.
#### Intermediate-mass black holes and contribution to extragalactic background light from Population III stars in Milky Way-like galaxies

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02245

 - **Abstract**
 The mass range of observed black holes extends from stellar-mass to supermassive scales, yet the existence of objects in the intermediate-mass range of $10^{2} - 10^{5} \text{M}_{\odot}$ remains unconfirmed. Black holes are suspected to compress the surrounding dark matter distribution, forming a ``spike''. If dark matter is self-annihilating, the spike could produce gamma-ray emission sufficiently luminous to be detected. This work aims to estimate the number of expected unmerged intermediate-mass black holes in a Milky Way-like galaxy that could form such spikes. These intermediate-mass black holes are assumed to have formed from the collapse of high-mass Population III stars, such that the resulting merger rate is constrained by observations of gravitational wave emission. It is furthermore estimated to what extent the progenitor Population III stars contribute to the extragalactic background light. The Population III stars are simulated and tracked using the A-SLOTH semi-analytical simulation code and the resulting number of intermediate-mass black holes is constrained by applying the Population III binary black hole merger rate to an effective volume determined from the Population III star formation rate. In this framework, $\sim 130$ unmerged IMBHs from Population III stars are expected to reside in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The contribution of their progenitors to the EBL in the near-infrared is less than $10^{-3} \text{nW} \text{m}^{-2} \text{sr}^{-1}$, well below previous estimates.
#### An interferometric study of B star multiplicity

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are extremely influential objects and multiplicity has the potential to dictate how they evolve over time by causing dynamical interactions, common-envelope evolution, mergers and more. While O-star multiplicity has been studied over a broad separation range, studies of B star multiplicity are lacking despite the fact that they dominate the production of core-collapse supernovae and neutron stars. We analyse interferometric data at high-angular resolution taken with PIONIER/VLTI for a sample of 32 B stars. Using parametric modelling of the closure phases and visibilities, we determine best-fit models to each of the systems and investigate whether each source is best represented by a single star or a higher-order system. Detection limits were calculated for companions to determine if they were significant. We then combined our findings from the interferometric data with results from a literature search to see if other companions were reported at different separation ranges. We find that, within the interferometric range, 72$\pm$8\% of the B stars are resolved as multiple systems. The most common type of system is a triple system, followed by binary systems, presumably single stars and then higher-order systems. The interferometric companion fraction derived for the sample is 1.88$\pm$0.24. When accounting for the spectroscopic companions confirmed in the literature and wide companions inferred from Gaia data in addition to companions we find with interferometry, multiplicity and companion fractions of 0.88$\pm$0.06 and 2.31$\pm$0.27 respectively are obtained for our sample. The number of triple systems in particular increases significantly when accounting for spectroscopic companions, suggesting that binarity and higher-order multiplicity are integral to the evolution of B stars, as they are for O stars.
#### Computational Insights into the Chemical Reaction Networks of C3H6O3,C3H7O3 and C2H5O2: Implications for the Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) is central to astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry, as these species may act as precursors to biomolecules essential for life. Although glyceraldehyde (HOCH2CH(OH)C(O)H, GCA) has not yet been detected in the ISM, the presence of structurally related compounds in various astronomical environments suggests that it may form under interstellar conditions. In this study, we employed the automated reaction discovery tool AutoMeKin to systematically explore the gas-phase chemical reaction networks (CRNs) of C3H6O3 (GCA), C3H7O3 (a hydrogenated analog), and C2H5O2. Reaction pathways were characterized at the wB97XD/Def2-TZVPP level of theory, and rate coefficients for key processes were computed using the competitive canonical unified statistical (CCUS) model, which accounts for multiple dynamic bottlenecks. Our analysis revealed several barrierless pathways leading to GCA or to GCA and a leaving group. Notably, the reaction between glyoxal (HCOHCO) and the HOCHCH2OH radical, though neither has yet been detected in the ISM, was found to efficiently produce GCA and a formyl radical. However, aside from the aforementined exception, most GCA formation channels result in highly vibrationally excited intermediates that are more likely to undergo rapid unimolecular decomposition than to be stabilized by radiative emission under typical ISM conditions. These results suggest that while gas-phase GCA formation is chemically feasible, it is likely transient and difficult to detect directly. In contrast, alternative products such as formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and (Z)-ethene-1,2-diol dominate many pathways and align better with current astronomical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are often considered as the main sites of acceleration of cosmic rays in our Galaxy, possibly up to the knee. However, their ability to accelerate particles to reach PeV energies is questionable and lacks observational evidence. Theoretical predictions suggest that only a small subclass of very young SNRs evolving in dense environments could potentially satisfy the necessary conditions to accelerate particles to PeV energies. Most such theoretical investigations are carried out either in the standard interstellar medium or in the wind of the progenitor. Since most core collapse supernovae occur in star clusters, it is important to extend such investigation to SNRs taking place in a star cluster. In this work we focus on a SNR shock propagating in the collective wind of a compact star cluster, and we study the acceleration process as a function time, with special emphasis on the maximum energy of accelerated particles. Using both analytic and numerical approaches we investigate the spectrum of accelerated particles and maximum achievable energy in the case of pre-existing turbulence in the collective wind and self-generated magnetic perturbations. We find that similar to isolated SNRs, acceleration to PeV energies is plausible only for extreme conditions achievable only in a small subset of SNRs.
#### Observations of the temporal evolution of Saturn's stratosphere following the Great Storm of 2010-2011 I. Temporal evolution of the water abundance in Saturn's hot vortex of 2011-2013

 - **Abstract**
 Water vapour is delivered to Saturn's stratosphere by Enceladus' plumes and subsequent diffusion in the planet system. It is expected to condense into a haze in the middle stratosphere. The hot stratospheric vortex (the `beacon') that formed as an aftermath of Saturn's Great Storm of 2010 significantly altered the temperature, composition, and circulation in Saturn's northern stratosphere. Previous photochemical models suggested haze sublimation and vertical winds as processes likely to increase the water vapour column density in the beacon. We aim to quantify the temporal evolution of stratospheric water vapour in the beacon during the storm. We mapped Saturn at 66.44 and 67.09 $\mu$m on seven occasions from July 2011 to February 2013 with the PACS instrument of the Herschel Space Observatory. The observations probe the millibar levels, at which the water condensation region was altered by the warmer temperatures in the beacon. Using radiative transfer modelling, we tested several empirical and physically based models to constrain the cause of the enhanced water emission found in the beacon. The observations show an increased emission in the beacon that cannot be reproduced only accounting for the warmer temperatures. An additional source of water vapour is thus needed. We find a factor (7.5$\pm$1.6) increase in the water column in the beacon compared to pre-storm conditions using empirical models. Combining our results with a cloud formation model for July 2011, we evaluate the sublimation contribution to 45-85% of the extra column derived from the water emission increase in the beacon. The observations confirm that the storm conditions enhanced the water abundance at the millibar levels because of haze sublimation and vertical winds in the beacon. Future work on the haze temporal evolution during the storm will help to better constrain the sublimation contribution over time.
#### The Secular Periodic Evolution of X-ray Quasi-periodic Eruptions Driven by Star-disc Collisions

 - **Abstract**
 We study the secular periodic evolution of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) for GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 assuming that they are driven by star-disc collisions. We set up numerical simulations and compared them with the observed periodic decay of $\sim -3160\pm720$ s yr$^{-1}$ in GSN069 and $\sim -370\pm40$ s yr$^{-1}$ in eRO-QPE2. We find that: (1) Stellar mass black holes are unlikely the orbiters in these two sources, as their periodic decay are on the order of $<10$ s yr$^{-1}$; (2) A naked degenerate core (including white dwarf) is unlikely the orbiter in GSN069, as the decay is on the order of $<200$ s yr$^{-1}$. However, it is possible in eRO-QPE2, although the required surface density of the accretion disc is relatively high (e.g., $\Sigma\gtrsim10^7\sim 10^8$ g cm$^{-2}$); (3) Both the orbiters in GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 can be solar-like main-sequence stars (MSs). However, each collision can lead to gradual ablation of the stellar envelope in the order of $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$. To reproduce the observed decay while surviving for $\gtrsim 3$ yr, the surface density of the disc needs to be within a certain range. For example, given a $1M_\odot$ MS orbiter the surface density of the disc gas should be in the range of $3\times10^5\sim 2\times10^6$g cm$^{-2}$ for GSN069 or $5\times10^4\sim 10^6$ g cm$^{-2}$ for eRO-QPE2. In both of these two sources, the MS can not survive for more than $\sim 12$ yr. We expect that future observations of these two sources can help to distinguish whether the orbiters are degenerated compact objects or gaseous stars.
#### Thermonuclear Heating of Accreting Neutron Stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02600

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a new method to incorporate thermonuclear heating in the envelope of accreting neutron star into long term simulations of their thermal evolution. We obtain boundary conditions for the heat exchange between the envelope and the crust based on stationary models which include nuclear burning and validate these values comparing to the results of the time-dependent code \texttt{MESA}. These simple boundary conditions allow us to explore a large parameter space. We quantify the amount of heat flowing from the envelope into the crust, or viceversa, depending on the mass accretion rate, outburst duration and duty cycle, and especially crust/core physical parameters such as impurities, crustal heating, and neutrino cooling rate.
#### Two More Bow Shocks and Off-Center Halpha Nebulae Associated with Nova-like Cataclysmic Variables

 - **Abstract**
 We report discoveries of bow-shock nebulae, seen in Halpha and [O III] 5007, around two cataclysmic variables (CVs): LS Pegasi and ASASSN-V J205457.73+515731.9 (hereafter ASASJ2054). Additionally, both stars lie near the edges of faint extended Halpha-emitting nebulae. The orientations of the bow shocks are consistent with the directions of the objects' proper motions. The properties of LS Peg and ASASJ2054, and of their nebulae, are remarkably similar to those of SY Cancri, which we described in a recent paper; SY Cnc is a CV likewise associated with a bow shock and an off-center Halpha nebula. These objects join V341 Arae and BZ Camelopardalis, CVs that are also accompanied by similar nebulae. All five stars belong to the nova-like variable (NLV) subclass of CVs, characterized by luminous optically thick accretion disks that launch fast winds into the surrounding space. We suggest that the bow shocks and nebulae result from chance encounters of the NLVs with interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes Stromgren zones that are recombining after being photoionized by the CVs' ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. Our discoveries illustrate the power of small telescopes equipped with modern instrumentation, and used to accumulate extremely long exposure times, for the detection of very low-surface-brightness nebulae.
#### Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). IV. Synergy between astrometry and direct imaging missions of the Habitable World Observatory for detecting Earth-like planets

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and characterization of habitable planets around nearby stars persist as one of the foremost objectives in contemporary astrophysics. This work investigates the synergistic integration of astrometric and direct imaging techniques by capitalizing on the complementary capabilities of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) and Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Planetary brightness and position vary over time due to phase effects and orbital architectures, information that can be precisely provided by CHES's astrometric measurements. By combining the precise orbital constraints from CHES with the imaging capabilities of HWO, we evaluate the improvements in detection efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio and overall planet yield. Completeness is quantified as the fraction of injected planets that are successfully detected, while yields are estimated for various scenarios using terrestrial planet occurrence rates derived from the Kepler dataset. Our results indicate that prior astrometric data significantly enhance detection efficiency. Under the adopted detection limit, our analysis indicates that prior CHES observations can increase completeness by approximately 10% and improve detection efficiency by factors ranging from two to thirty. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the search for and characterization of habitable worlds.
