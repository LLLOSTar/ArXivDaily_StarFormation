#### Gotta Go Fast: A Generalization of the Escape Speed to Fluid-dynamical Explosions and Implications for Astrophysical Transients

 - **Abstract**
 A star's ability to explode in a core-collapse supernova is correlated with its density profile, $\rho(r)$, such that compact stars with shallow density profiles preferentially ``fail'' and produce black holes. This correlation can be understood from a mass perspective, as shallower density profiles enclose $\sim 3M_{\odot}$ (i.e., the maximum neutron-star mass) at relatively small radii, but could also be due to the fact that a shockwave (driving the explosion) inevitably stalls if the density profile into which it propagates is shallower than $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2}$. Here we show that this condition -- the density profile being steeper than $\rho \propto r^{-2}$ -- is necessary, but not sufficient, for generating a strong explosion. In particular, we find solutions to the fluid equations that describe a shockwave propagating at a fixed fraction of the local freefall speed into a temporally evolving, infalling medium, the density profile of which scales as $\rho \propto r^{-n}$ at large radii. The speed of the shock diverges as $n\rightarrow 2$ and declines (eventually to below the Keplerian escape speed) as $n$ increases, while the total energy contained in the explosion approaches zero as the shock recedes to large distances. These solutions therefore represent fluid-dynamical analogs of marginally bound orbits, and yield the ``shock escape speed'' as a function of the density profile. We also suggest that stellar explodability is correlated with the power-law index of the density at $\sim10^9$ cm, where the neutrino diffusion time equals the local dynamical time for most massive stars, which agrees with supernova simulations.
#### 3D full-GR simulations of magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae on GPUs: A systematic study of rotation rates and magnetic fields

 - **Abstract**
 We present a series of fully three-dimensional, dynamical-spacetime general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) for a progenitor of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $25\, M_\odot$. We simulate a total of 12 models for simulation times in the range $190-260\, \mathrm{ms}$ to systematically study the effect of rotation rates and magnetic fields on jet formation via the magnetorotational mechanism. We have performed simulations on OLCF's Frontier using the new GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code \theCode for magnetic fields $B_0 = (10^{11}, 10^{12})\, \mathrm{G}$ and rotation rates $\Omega_0 = (0.14, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$. We always resolve the entire region containing the shock with a resolution of at least $1.48\, \mathrm{km}$. We find that models with $B_0=10^{11}\, \mathrm{G}$ fail to explode, while those with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ show a wide range of jet morphologies and explosive outcomes depending on the rotation rate. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0=(1.0,1.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ form jets that bend sideways, giving the ejecta a more spherical character, and possibly representing explosions that \textit{appear} neutrino-driven even though they are magnetorotationally-driven. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0\geq2.0\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ show ejecta velocities $\gtrsim15000\, \mathrm{km/s}$, making them suitable candidates for broad-lined type Ic supernova progenitors. This work represents the largest set of 3D general-relativistic GRMHD simulations studying magnetorotational supernovae in full GR and demonstrates the potential of systematic studies with GPU-accelerated 3D simulations of CCSNe.
#### Short-range ordering and equilibrium structure of binary crystal mixtures of atomic nuclei in white dwarf cores

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11545

 - **Abstract**
 Mixtures of bare atomic nuclei on a nearly uniform degenerate electron background are a realistic model of matter in the interior of white dwarfs. Despite tremendous progress in understanding their phase diagrams achieved mainly via first-principle simulations, structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of such mixtures are poorly understood. We develop a semi-analytic model of the crystal state of binary mixtures based on the concept of mutual short-range ordering of ions of different sorts. We derive analytic formulas for electrostatic energy of crystal mixtures, including the effect of static ion displacements from the lattice nodes, and estimate their residual entropy. Then we perform free energy minimization with respect to the order parameters for a C/O mixture at all relevant compositions and temperatures. The resulting C/O phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with that obtained in the most recent first-principle study. The equilibrium microstructure of a crystallized mixture is shown to evolve with decrease of temperature which, in principle, can induce structural transitions. The latter will be accompanied by thermal energy release. The proposed theory opens up a path to analyze ordering and construct phase diagrams of ternary mixtures, which are of great practical interest in astrophysics, as well as to improve calcuations of electron-ion scattering rates and kinetic properties of dense crystallized matter.
#### CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11577

 - **Abstract**
 The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with $\sim$15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, "When does planet formation begin?", we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{\rm bol} \le 1900$ K), all mapped at 1.3 mm with resolutions ranging from 4 to 33 au. To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of bolometric temperature, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least four resolution elements ($\theta_{\rm disk}/\theta_{\rm res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the bolometric temperature measurements, to constrain the lower and upper limits of bolometric temperature for each source. We find that by $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$, substructure detection rates increased sharply to $\sim$60%, corresponding to an approximate age of $0.2-0.4$ Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of these structures at $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$ could represent only an upper limit.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new radio continuum study of the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant (SNR) MC SNR J0519-6902. With a diameter of ~8 pc, this SNR shows a radio ring-like morphology with three bright regions toward the north, east, and south. Its linear polarisation is prominent with average values of 5 +- 1% and 6 +- 1% at 5500 and 9000 MHz, and we find a spectral index of -0.62 +- 0.02 , typical of a young SNR. The average rotation measure is estimated at -124 +- 83 rad m-2 and the magnetic field strength at ~11 muG. We also estimate an equipartition magnetic field of 72 +- 5 muG and minimum explosion energy of Emin = 2.6x1048 erg. Finally, we identified an H I cloud that may be associated with MC SNR J0519-6902, located in the southeastern part of the remnant, along with a potential wind-bubble cavity.
#### Asymmetric Cross-Correlation functions with delays in Sco X-1: Evidence of possible Jet triggering

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and origin of Jets from Z sources are not well understood, although an X-ray-radio correlation has been observed. We analyzed a few observations of Sco X-1 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Experiment Satellite. Out of the 17 observations, 5 showed lags of a few 10s of seconds with an asymmetry in the CCF between the soft and hard bands in their cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis. Interestingly, during these observations, a ballistic-type radio jet of Ultra-relativistic(UR) nature was reported. The observed lags and associated cross-correlation coefficients were validated using simulations. The rest of the 12 observations' CCFs were symmetric, and their associated Power Density Spectrum (PDS) displayed Normal Branch(NBO)/Normal + Horizontal Branch Oscillations(NBO+HBO). The X-ray spectral study of 2 obs. where radio core emission was seen with abrupt variation in both PDS and CCF showed a black-body flux variation of 10-20%, but no spectral parameter varied. We suggest that the ballistic jet caused a disturbance in the inner accretion region, viz., the Boundary Layer plausibly along with the Corona, that caused the lags observed in the CCFs along with the absence of any oscillatory features in the PDS tracing only a flat-topped noise. Whereas the regions with no lags showed a persistent NBO/NBO+HBO feature, suggesting a steady accretion flow. Although the UR jet can't be related to NBO or HBO, we suggest it could be related to the phenomena that cause NBO since the majority of PDSs displayed NBO. We also constrain the inner accretion region size to 20-30 km, which is responsible for the accretion ejecta in Sco X-1.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores, those cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as initial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores, however, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well characterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission, which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions, particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result serves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the dynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer compelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores and the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these cores.
#### The AstroSat UV Deep Field South. III. Evolution of the UV Luminosity Function and Luminosity Density from z~0.8-0.4

 - **Abstract**
 We characterise the rest-frame 1500 Å UV luminosity Function (UVLF) from deep AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging in the Great Observatories Origins Survey South (GOODS-S) deep field. The UVLFs are constructed and subsequently characterised with fitted Schechter function parameters from FUV observations at z$<0.13$ and NUV observations in seven redshift bins in z~0.8-0.4. The UVLF slope ($\alpha$) and characteristic magnitude ($M^*$) are consistent with previous determinations for this redshift range based on AstroSat/UVIT GOODS-North observations, as well as with those from Galaxy evolution Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope observations. However, differences in the normalisation factor ($\phi_{*}$) are present for UVLFs for some redshift bins. We compute the UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$, combining our determined UVLF parameters with literature determinations out to z$\sim10$. The $\rho_{\rm UV}$ trend with redshift implies the rapid increase in cosmic star formation till its peak at z$\sim3$ (cosmic noon) followed by a slow decline till present day. Both the initial increase in cosmic star formation and subsequent decline are found to be more rapid than previous determinations.
#### The "Little Dark Dot": Evidence for Self-Interacting Dark Matter in the Strong Lens SDSSJ0946+1006?

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies, based on precise modeling of a gravitationally lensing image, have identified what may be a extremely compact, dark perturber in the well-known lensing system SDSSJ0946+1006 (the "Jackpot"). Its remarkable compactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this paper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a core-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model. Using the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of core-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations indicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately $10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass enclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such a massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble imaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model struggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the "little dark dot" in the "Jackpot" lens.
#### Planetary albedo is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere: Implications for sub-Neptune climate

 - **Abstract**
 Energy limits that delineate the `habitable zone' for exoplanets depend on a given exoplanet's net planetary albedo (or `Bond albedo'). We here demonstrate that the planetary albedo of an observed exoplanet is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere - the region of the atmosphere that is probed in remote observation. We derive an analytic model to explore how the maximum planetary albedo depends on the above-cloud optical depth and scattering versus absorbing properties, even in the limit of a perfectly reflective grey cloud layer. We apply this framework to sub-Neptune K2-18b, for which a high planetary albedo has recently been invoked to argue for the possibility of maintaining a liquid water ocean surface, despite K2-18b receiving an energy flux from its host star that places it inside of its estimated `habitable zone' inner edge. We use a numerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model to retrieve the albedo of K2-18b based on the observational constraints from the above-cloud atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that K2-18b's observed transmission spectrum already restricts its possible planetary albedo to values below the threshold required to be potentially habitable, with the data favouring a median planetary albedo of 0.17-0.18. Our results thus reveal that currently characteriseable sub-Neptunes are likely to be magma-ocean or gas-dwarf worlds. The methods that we present are generally applicable to constrain the planetary albedo of any exoplanet with measurements of its observable atmosphere, enabling the quantification of potential exoplanet habitability with current observational capabilities.
#### Activity-Induced Near-Infrared Variability at 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, 2017-2022

 - **Abstract**
 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (SW1) is both the first-discovered active Centaur and the most outburst-prone comet known. The nature of SW1's many outbursts, which regularly brighten the comet by five magnitudes or more, and what processes power them has been of particular interest since SW1's discovery in the 1920s. In this paper, we present and model four epochs of low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of SW1 taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and Lowell Discovery Telescope between 2017 and 2022. This dataset includes one large outburst, two periods of low activity ("quiescence" or "quiescent activity"), and one mid-sized outburst a few days after one of the quiescent observations. The two quiescent epochs appear similar in both spectral slope and modeled grain size distributions, but the two outbursts are significantly different. We propose that the two can be reconciled if smaller dust grains are accelerated more than larger ones, such that observations closer to the onset of an outburst are more sensitive to the finer-grained dust on the outside of the expanding cloud of material. These outbursts can thus appear very rapid but there is still a period in which the dust and gas are well-coupled. We find no strong evidence of water ice absorption in any of our spectra, suggesting that the areal abundance of ice-dominated grains is less than one percent. We conclude with a discussion of future modeling and monitoring efforts which might be able to further advance our understanding of this object's complicated activity patterns.
#### Pulsar Coherent Radio Emission from Solitons : Average Emission Properties

 - **Abstract**
 Observations have established that coherent radio emission from pulsars arise at few hundred kilometers above stellar surface. Recent polarization studies have further demonstrated that plasma instabilities are necessary for charge bunching that gives rise to coherent emission. The formation of charged solitons in the electron-positron plasma is the only known bunching mechanism that can be realised at these heights. More than five decades of observations have revealed a number of emission features that should emerge from any valid radio emission mechanism. We have carried out numerical calculations to find the features of average emission from curvature radiation due to charged solitons. The characteristic curvature radiation spectrum has been updated from the well known one-dimensional dependence into a general two-dimensional form, and contribution from each soliton along observer's line of sight (LOS) has been added to reproduce the pulsar emission. The outflowing plasma is formed by sparking discharges above the stellar surface that are located within concentric rings resembling the core-cone emission beam, and uniform distribution of solitons along any LOS has been assumed. The observed effects of radius to frequency mapping, where the lower frequency emission originates from higher altitudes, is seen in this setup. The power law spectrum and relative steepening of the core spectra with respect to the cones also emerges. The estimated polarization position angle reflects the geometrical configuration of pulsars as expected. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of coherent curvature radiation from charged solitons to reproduce the average observational features of pulsars.
#### Magnetically driven outflows in 3D common-envelope evolution of massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the common-envelope interaction revealed the self-consistent formation of bipolar magnetically driven outflows launched from a toroidal structure resembling a circumbinary disk. So far, the dynamical impact of bipolar outflows on the common-envelope phase remains uncertain and we aim to quantify its importance. We illustrate the impact on common-envelope evolution by comparing two simulations -- one with magnetic fields and one without -- using the three-dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. We focus on the specific case of a $10 M_\odot$ red supergiant star with a $5 M_\odot$ black hole companion. By the end of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations (after $\sim 1220$ orbits of the core binary system), about $6.4 \%$ of the envelope mass is ejected via the bipolar outflow, contributing to angular momentum extraction from the disk structure and core binary. The resulting enhanced torques reduce the final orbital separation by about $24 \%$ compared to the hydrodynamical scenario, while the overall envelope ejection remains dominated by recombination-driven equatorial winds. We analyze field amplification and outflow launching mechanisms, confirming consistency with earlier studies: magnetic fields are amplified by shear flows, and outflows are launched by a magneto-centrifugal process, supported by local shocks and magnetic pressure gradients. These outflows originate from $\sim 1.1$ times the orbital separation. We conclude that the magnetically driven outflows and their role in the dynamical interaction are a universal aspect, and we further propose an adaptation of the $\alpha_\mathrm{CE}$-formalism by adjusting the final orbital energy with a factor of $1+ M_\mathrm{out}/\mu$, where $M_\mathrm{out}$ is the mass ejected through the outflows and $\mu$ the reduced mass of the core binary.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to T~5 MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter.
