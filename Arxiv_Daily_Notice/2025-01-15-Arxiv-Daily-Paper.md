 - **Abstract**
 The early evolution of protostellar, star-forming discs, including their density structure, turbulence, magnetic dynamics, and accretion variability, remains poorly understood. We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics down to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a molecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a protostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation, achieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the evolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field structures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of approximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts influenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The disc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\sim2$. The magnetic field is wound up by rotational motions, generating a magneto-centrifugal outflow, while episodic accretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and magnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and magnetic pressure and an Alfvén Mach number of ~ 2. The disc density profiles steepen over time, following a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the minimum mass solar nebula. These results underscore the role of turbulence in early accretion variability and offer new insights into the physical and magnetic structure of young protostellar discs.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at $z=2.53$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to $\sim2$ Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at $z\sim10$. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative $\sim2-3\times$ higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, $\sim10^6-10^7~M_{\odot}$, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray observations collected over the last decades have revealed a strongly variable X-ray signal within the Milky Way's Galactic center, interpreted as X-ray echoes from its supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These echoes are traced by the strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV of which its intensity is proportional to the density of the illuminated molecular gas. Over time, the echo scans through molecular clouds (MCs) in our Galactic center, revealing their 3D structure and highlighting their densest parts. While previous studies have utilized spectral line doppler shifts along with kinematic models to constrain the geometry of the CMZ or to study the structure of individual clouds, these methods have limitations, particularly in the turbulent region of the CMZ. We use archival Chandra X-ray data to construct one of the first 3D representations of one prominent MC, the Stone Cloud, located at (l = 0.068°, b = -0.076°) at a distance of ~20pc from Sgr A* in projection. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we followed the X-ray echo in this cloud from 2008 to 2017. We combine this data with 1.3 mm dust continuum emission observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Herschel Space Observatory to re-construct the 3D structure of the cloud and estimate the column densities for each year's observed slice. The analysis of the X-ray echoes along with velocities from SMA molecular line data indicate that the structure of the Stone cloud can be described as a very diffuse background with multiple dense clumps throughout.

 - **Abstract**
 Using optical and near-infrared images of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant covering the time period 1951 to 2022, together with optical spectra of selected filaments, we present an investigation of Cas A's reverse shock velocity and the effects it has on the remnant's metal-rich ejecta. We find the sequence of optical ejecta brightening and the appearance of new optical ejecta indicating the advancement of the remnant's reverse shock in the remnant's main shell has velocities typically between 1000 and 2000 km/s, which is ~1000 km/s less than recent measurements made in X-rays. We further find the reverse shock appears to move much more slowly and is nearly even stationary in the sky frame along the remnant's western limb. However, we do not find the reverse shock to move inward at velocities as large as ~2000 km/s as has been reported. Optical ejecta in Cas A's main emission shell have proper motions indicating outward tangential motions ~3500 - 6000 km/s, with the smaller values preferentially along the remnant's southern regions which we speculate may be partially the cause of the remnant's faint and more slowly evolving southern sections. Following interaction with the reverse shock, ejecta knots exhibit extended mass ablated trails 0.2" - 0.5" in length leading to extended emission indicating reverse shock induced decelerated velocities as large as 1000 km/s. Such ablated material is most prominently seen in higher ionization line emissions, whereas denser parts of ejecta knots show surprisingly little deceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomers have used observations of the Galactic gas and dust via infrared, microwave, and radio to study molecular clouds in extreme environments such as the Galactic center. More recently, X- ray telescopes have opened up a new wavelength range in which to study these molecular clouds. Previous flaring events from SgrA* propagate X-rays outwards in all directions, and these X-rays interact with the surrounding molecular gas, illuminating different parts of the clouds over time. We use a combination of X-ray observations from Chandra and molecular gas tracers (line data from Herschel and the Submillimeter Array) to analyze specific features in the Sticks cloud, one of three clouds in the Three Little Pigs system in the Central Molecular Zone (Galactic longitude and latitude of 0.106 and -0.082 degrees respectively). We also present a novel X-ray tomography method we used to create 3-D map of the Sticks cloud. By combining X-ray and molecular tracer observations, we are able to learn more about the environment inside the Sticks cloud.
#### Planetary Nebulae

 - **Abstract**
 Planetary nebulae are formed by the matter ejected by low-to-intermediate mass stars (~0.8-8 times the mass of the Sun) towards the end of their lives. As hydrogen and then helium fuel sources run out, stars expand. During these giant phases stars also lose sizable amounts of mass. During the second giant phase, after the exhaustion of core helium, the mass loss is so great that stars lose a large fraction of their mass (50 - 90%), leaving behind a small, hot core, known as a white dwarf, surrounded by a nebula. Planetary nebulae are the result of many processes that shape and alter their ionization structure and chemical composition. The resulting nebula, illuminated by the ultraviolet-rich spectrum of the remnant very hot stellar core, is a spectacle of beauty and science. In this chapter, we show that these objects are invaluable laboratories for astrophysics, astrochemistry, and astromineralogy studies, with impact in many areas of Astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Open star clusters are dynamic systems whose evolution is critically influenced by initial conditions such as star formation efficiency and orbital parameters. Understanding their dissolution mechanisms provides insight into stellar population dynamical mixing in the Milky Way. We aim to investigate the dynamical evolution and dissolution of initially non-virialised open clusters by examining how different global star formation efficiencies and orbital characteristics impact the cluster longevity and structural changes. We followed the evolution of the clusters up to their dissolution time on the basis of our calculations. We compare our open cluster dynamical evolutionary models with the observed open clusters in our Galaxy's solar vicinity. Using high-order direct N-body simulations, we modelled cluster evolution across different Galactic orbits, systematically varying initial star formation efficiencies to comprehensively explore dissolution mechanisms. Our simulations reveal that open clusters typically survive approximately ten orbital periods, with cluster lifetime being strongly dependent on global star formation efficiency and only marginally influenced by orbital eccentricity. We estimate gas expulsion timescales of 0.9 Myr, with initial supernova explosions efficiently removing gaseous components from the cluster. The expected lifetime of the cluster (in units of orbital periods) strongly depends on the cluster global star-formation efficiency and only slightly on the orbital eccentricities of the cluster. The theoretical models demonstrate a remarkable agreement of the Roche-volobe filling parameter with the recent observed Gaia DR3 cluster catalogues in the solar vicinity. By incorporating a mixed sample of clusters with varying star formation efficiencies, we provide a more nuanced understanding of open cluster evolution in the Galactic disc.
#### Global 3-D Simulations of Magnetospheric Accretion: II. Hot Spots, Equilibrium Torque, Episodic Wind, and Midplane Outflow

 - **Abstract**
 Global 3-D magnetohydrodynamical simulations have been conducted to study magnetospheric accretion around stars with various spin rates. For slow rotators, characterized by a fastness parameter $\omega_s\lesssim 0.78$, the disk's inner edge at the magnetospheric truncation radius becomes unstable to the interchange instability, leading to intruding filaments which produce hot spots closer to the stellar equator. Depending on spin rate, slow rotators can be in ``chaotic'' or ``ordered'' unstable regimes. For fast rotators, the interchange instability is suppressed by the super-Keplerian rotation beyond the corotation radius, and hot spots are generated only through polar accretion. Low- and mid-energy flux hot spots cover $\lesssim20\%$ and $\lesssim3\%$ of the surface, with faster rotators tending to produce hotter spots. Beyond the truncation radius, angular momentum transfers from the disk surface to the midplane, resulting in surface accretion and midplane outflow. The midplane outflow may transport thermally processed materials (e.g. those in chondrites) to the outer disk. Field inflation generates episodic winds with mass-loss rates $\sim 1\%-40\%$ of the accretion rate, depending on stellar spin. Frequent magnetic reconnections lead to efficient star-disk coupling. We derive the torque exerted by the disk on the star as a function of stellar spin. For fast rotators/propellers, both spin-down torque and disk wind rate increase dramatically with stellar spin. The equilibrium spin state occurs at $\omega_s\sim0.7$, with wind/jet speeds ($\sim$500 km/s) and mass loss rates ($\sim10\%$ accretion rate) aligning with observations. Most results are insensitive to disk thickness. Finally, we present testable predictions for how observables vary with stellar spin.
#### A Disintegrating Rocky World Shrouded in Dust and Gas: Mid-IR Observations of K2-22b using JWST

 - **Abstract**
 The disintegrating ultra-short period rocky exoplanet K2-22b periodically emits dusty clouds in a dynamically chaotic process resulting in a variable transit depth from 0-1.3%. The effluents that sublimate off the surface and condense out in space are probably representative of the formerly interior layers convectively transported to the molten surface. Transmission spectroscopy of these transiting clouds reveal spectral fingerprints of the interior composition of this rocky world. We used JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) as a low-resolution slitless spectrograph to observe four predicted transit windows for K2-22b. For each observation, we extracted a transmission spectrum over the spectral range of 4.3-11.8 $\mu$m. We detect one transit at high significance and two at low significance. We find that the data 1) disfavor featureless, iron-dominated core material, 2) are consistent with some form of magnesium silicate minerals, likely from mantle material, and 3) show a distinct and unexpected feature at $\sim$5 $\mu$m. The unexpected feature, also seen weakly in the low-significance transits, is consistent with some gas features, possibly NO and/or CO$_2$. These findings warrant further study to improve the constraints on the composition of this disintegrating rocky world.
