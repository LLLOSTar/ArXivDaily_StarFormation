#### The role of magnetic field and stellar feedback in the evolution of filamentary structures in collapsing star-forming clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Filaments are common features in molecular clouds and they play a key role in star formation (SF). Studying their life cycle is essential to fully understand the SF process. Aims: We aim to characterise the impact of magnetic field ($B$) and stellar feedback on the evolution of filamentary structures in star-forming clouds. Methods: We performed two numerical simulations of a collapsing $10^4\,$M$_\odot$ cloud with different mass-to-flux ratios ($\mu=2$ and $\mu=8$), including early stellar feedback (jets and HII regions). Using DisPerSE, we extracted the three-dimensional filamentary network and analysed its properties as it evolves throughout the SF event. Results: We observed that the filamentary network in the simulations follow two distinct evolutionary pathways. In the strongly magnetised case, the cloud maintains a sparser filamentary network, and the arising filaments are predominantly perpendicular to $B$ lines. With a weak field, the cloud develops a single central hub, with converging filaments favouring a parallel alignment relative to $B$. Furthermore, while always accreting, filaments exhibit faster flows towards the hub relative to the surrounding gas. In the weakly magnetised run, the central hub dominates the dynamics, and filaments exhibit faster flows as they approach the central hub. Finally, once the expanding HII region impacts the filaments, they align to $B$ independently of the initial configuration. Conclusions: Magnetic fields play a critical role in shaping the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds. Stronger magnetic fields slow the cloud's evolution and inhibit the formation of central hubs, promoting a broader filamentary network instead. However, ionising feedback dominates the late-stage evolution, overriding the initial differences and dictating the final filament configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 We present early multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type IIb supernova SN 2024uwq, capturing its shock-cooling emission phase and double-peaked light curve evolution. Early spectra reveal broad H-alpha (v ~ 15,500 km s$^{-1}$) and He I P-Cygni profiles of similar strengths. Over time the He I lines increase in strength while the H-alpha decreases, consistent with a hydrogen envelope ($M_{env}$ = 0.7 - 1.35 $M_\odot$ ) overlying helium-rich ejecta. Analytic modeling of early shock cooling emission and bolometric light analysis constrains the progenitor to a partially stripped star with radius R = 10 - 60 $R_\odot$, consistent with a blue/yellow supergiant with an initial ZAMS mass of 12 - 20 $M_\odot$ , likely stripped via binary interaction. SN 2024uwq occupies a transitional position between compact and extended Type IIb supernovae, highlighting the role of binary mass-transfer efficiency in shaping a continuum of stripped-envelope progenitors. Our results underscore the importance of both early UV/optical observations to characterize shock breakout signatures critical to map the diversity in evolutionary pathways of massive stars. Upcoming time domain surveys including Rubin Observatory's LSST and UV missions like ULTRASAT and UVEX will revolutionise our ability to systematically capture these early signatures, probing the full diversity of stripped progenitors and their explosive endpoints.

 - **Abstract**
 In spite of accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of the Interstellar Medium (ISM), dust plays a primary role in many physical and chemical processes in the Universe. It is the main driver of extinction of radiation in the UV/optical wavelength range and a primary source of thermal IR emission. Dust grains contain most of the refractory elements of the ISM and they host chemical processes that involve complex molecular compounds. However, observational evidence suggests that grain structure is highly non-trivial and that dust particles are characterized by granularity, asymmetry and stratification, which significantly affect their interaction with radiation fields. Accurate modeling of such interaction is fundamental to properly explain observational results, but it is a computationally demanding task. Here we present the possibility to investigate the effects of radiation/particle interactions in non-spherically symmetric conditions using a novel implementation of the Transition Matrix formalism, designed to run on scalable parallel hardware facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the spectroscopic appearance of very massive stars and their effect on the integrated light of starbursts at low metallicity (Z). We adopt two frameworks for the mass loss rates of VMS: in one case we assume no Z dependence, in the other case we assume a linear scaling with Z. We compute evolutionary models for masses 150, 200, 250 and 300 Msun at Z=0.2, 0.1 and 0.01 Zsun. We compute the associated synthetic spectra at selected points along the evolutionary tracks. Finally we build population synthesis models including VMS. We find that the evolution of VMS critically depends on the assumptions regarding mass loss rates. In case of no Z dependence VMS remain hot for all their lifetime. Conversely when mass loss rates are reduced because of lower Z VMS follow a classical evolution towards the red part of the HR diagram. VMS display HeII 1640 emission in most phases of their evolution, except when they become too cool. This line is present in the integrated light of population synthesis models down to 0.1 Zsun whatever the star formation history, and is also sometimes seen at Z=0.01 Zsun. HeII 1640 is weaker in models that include a Z scaling of the mass loss rates. The optical spectra of starbursts, especially the Wolf-Rayet bumps, sometimes display VMS signatures when these stars are present. At low Z, adding VMS to population synthesis models produces more ionising photons down to 45 eV. At higher energy the ionising flux depends on age, Z, assumption regarding VMS mass loss rates, and on the very short phases at the end of VMS evolution. HeII ionising fluxes large enough to produce some amount of nebular HeII 4686 emission can be produced under specific circumstances. Our models are able to reproduce qualitatively and sometimes also quantitatively the UV spectra of star-forming regions. However we are not able to clearly identify which mass loss framework is favoured.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent in situ observations from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) near perihelia reveal ion beams, temperature anisotropies, and kinetic wave activity. These features are likely linked to solar wind heating and acceleration. During PSP Encounter 17 (at $11.4R_s$) on Sep-26-2023, the PSP/FIELDS instrument detected enhanced ion-scale wave activity associated with deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium in ion velocity distribution functions (VDFs) observed by the PSP/Solar Probe Analyzers-Ion (SPAN-I). Dense beams (secondary populations) were present in the proton VDFs during this wave activity. Using bi-Maxwellian fits to the proton VDFs, we found that the density of the proton beam population increased during the wave activity and, unexpectedly, surpassed the core population at certain intervals. Interestingly, the wave power was reduced during the intervals when the beam population density exceeded the core density. The drift velocity of the beams decreases from 0.9 to 0.7 of the Alfvén speed and the proton core shows a higher temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel>2.5$) during these intervals. We conclude that the observations during these intervals are consistent with a reconnection event during a heliospheric current sheet crossing. During this event, $\alpha$ particle parameters (density, velocity, and temperature anisotropy) remained nearly constant. Using linear analysis, we examined how the proton beam drives instability or wave dissipation. Furthermore, We investigated the nonlinear evolution of ion kinetic instabilities using hybrid kinetic simulations. This study provides direct clues about energy transfer between particles and waves in the young solar wind.

 - **Abstract**
 With current and upcoming experiments on the horizon, the global 21-cm signal can open up new avenues for probing dark matter (DM) physics at redshifts that are otherwise inaccessible to other observables. This work investigates the effects of elastic scattering between DM and baryons on the global 21-cm signal in two distinct interacting DM (IDM) models: Coulomb-like and velocity-independent interactions. Our analysis incorporates key astrophysical parameters essential for accurately modeling the global signal, including star formation efficiency, escape fraction of ionizing photons, normalization of the X-ray luminosity, the number of Lyman-Werner photons emitted per stellar baryon, the minimum virial temperature of star-forming halos, as well as the IDM particle mass and cross section. We perform a Fisher analysis to forecast the sensitivity of four global 21-cm signal experimental scenarios as probes of DM-baryon scattering. We find that global signal experiments, even at the sensitivity of the current facilities such as EDGES and SARAS3, could improve existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints on DM-baryon scattering. Our results also highlight the degeneracies among the DM-baryon interaction cross section and astrophysical quantities. In particular, degeneracies between the IDM cross section and two astrophysical parameters, the minimum virial temperature, and Lyman-Werner photon production, can significantly impact the DM interaction inference. Conversely, the velocity-independent cross section is found to be insensitive to uncertainties in the X-ray luminosity. These findings underscore the necessity of accurately characterizing the uncertainties in astrophysical parameters to leverage the full potential of the 21-cm global signal experiments in probing IDM physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a significant role in stellar evolution. In the last few years, asteroseismology has enabled the measurement of strong magnetic fields $10^4$--$10^6\,\mathrm{G}$ in the cores of dozens of red giants, and is the only known way to directly measure internal stellar magnetic fields. However, current data are still interpreted assuming that these fields are too weak or too axisymmetric to affect the orientation of the pulsations (i.e., make the pulsations ``oblique''), rendering stronger field strengths beyond the reach of existing asteroseismic searches. We show that, even when an oblique pulsator is also stochastic (such as in a red giant with a strong non-axisymmetric magnetic field), geometric effects will cause the signal to contain frequency components which remain in perfect relative phase with each other. This perfect phase relationship persists even over timescales in which stochasticity erases absolute phase information. This perfect relative coherence is a distinctive observational signature of oblique pulsation that does not require a model for mode frequencies to search for. However, due to its dependence on phase, this effect will not be evident in the power spectral density alone, and phase information should be retained in order to detect it. Coherence-based searches for oblique pulsations may pave the way to measurements of magnetic fields of currently inaccessible strengths in red giants, as well as some main-sequence and compact pulsators.

 - **Abstract**
 High-precision infrared spectroscopic measurements now enable detailed characterization of sub-Neptune atmospheres, potentially providing constraints on their interiors. Motivated by this, atmospheric models have been developed to explore chemical interactions between hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and possibly underlying magma oceans with various redox states. Recent models have predicted monosilane (SiH$_4$) as a potential atmospheric species derived from magma oceans in sub-Neptunes, but suggested that it is highly depleted in the observable atmospheric layers. Here, we propose that SiH$_4$ can persist throughout the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes with FeO-free reduced magma oceans by considering the dissolution of H$_2$O into the magma oceans, a factor not accounted for in previous models. We construct a one-dimensional atmospheric model to simulate the chemical equilibrium composition of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres overlying FeO-free magma oceans, incorporating H-O-Si chemistry. Our results show that the dissolution of H$_2$O enhances the SiH$_4$ molar fraction to levels of 0.1--10~\%, preventing it from reverting to silicates in the upper atmospheric layers. We find that SiH$_4$-rich atmospheres can exist across a broad parameter space with ground temperatures of 2000--6000~K and hydrogen pressures of 10$^2$--10$^5$~bar. We discuss that SiH$_4$-rich atmospheres could contain the other silanes but lack C-/N-/O-bearing species. The detection of SiH$_4$ in future observations of sub-Neptunes would provide compelling evidence for the presence of a rocky core with a reduced magma ocean. However, the accuracy of our model is limited by the lack of data on the non-ideal behavior and radiative properties of SiH$_4$, highlighting the need for further numerical and laboratory investigations.
#### Reexploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA: Insights into chemical differentiation from the molecular composition of hot cores in Sgr B2(N2)

 - **Abstract**
 We used ALMA to perform a line survey of the high-mass star forming region Sgr B2(N), called ReMoCA. We modeled under the assumption of LTE the spectra obtained toward the sources embedded in the secondary hot core Sgr B2(N2). We compared the chemical composition of these sources to that of sources from the literature and to predictions of the chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL. We detected up to 58 molecules toward Sgr B2(N2)'s hot cores, including up to 24 COMs, as well as many less abundant isotopologs. The compositions of some pairs of sources are well correlated, but differences also exist in particular for HNCO and NH2CHO. The abundances of series of homologous molecules drop by about one order of magnitude at each further step in complexity. The nondetection of radicals yields stringent constraints on the models. The comparison to the chemical models confirms previous evidence of a high cosmic-ray ionization rate in Sgr B2(N). The comparison to sources from the literature gives new insight into chemical differentiation. The composition of most hot cores of Sgr B2(N2) is tightly correlated to that of the hot core G31.41+0.31 and the hot corino IRAS 16293-2422B after normalizing the abundances by classes of molecules (O-, N-, O+N-, and S-bearing). There is no overall correlation between Sgr B2(N2) and the shocked region G+0.693-0.027 also located in Sgr B2, and even less with the cold starless core TMC-1. The class of N-bearing species reveals the largest variance among the four classes of molecules. The S-bearing class shows in contrast the smallest variance. These results imply that the class of N-bearing molecules reacts more sensitively to shocks, low-temperature gas phase chemistry after non-thermal desorption, or density. The abundance shifts observed between the N- and O-bearing molecules may indicate how violently and completely the ice mantles are desorbed. [abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 The study of cyclic hydrocarbons is of utmost relevance in current astrochemical research, as they are considered to be among the most significant reservoirs of carbon in the interstellar medium. However, while unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons with three, five, and six carbon atoms have been widely investigated, the highly strained antiaromatic cyclobutadiene, c-C4H4, still remains uncharted. Here, we employed high-level CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12//B2PLYPD3/aug-cc-pVTZ theoretical calculations to analyze whether the cyano (CN), ethynyl (CCH), and hydroxy (OH) derivatives of c-C4H4 and its structural isomers butatriene (H2CCCCH2) and vinylacetylene (H2CCHCCH) can readily form via the gas-phase reaction: C4H4 + X -> C4H3X + H (where X = CN, CCH, and OH). For each system, we thoroughly explored the corresponding potential energy surfaces, identifying their critical points to enable a detailed analysis of the thermochemistry. Hence, we found various exothermic pathways for the formation of CN and CCH derivatives of butatriene and vinylacetylene, with no net activation barriers, while the formation of the OH derivatives is in general less favorable. Prior to the mechanistic study, we also analyzed the complete conformational panorama and stability of all the derivatives at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level. Overall, c-C4H3CN and c-C4H3CCH emerge as particularly promising candidates for interstellar detection, provided that the parental c-C4H4 is present in the gas phase. These findings highlight the potential for detecting polar derivatives of c-C4H4 as indirect evidence of its presence in the ISM, as it appears to be "invisible" to radioastronomical observations. Also, this study underscores the need for future laboratory and theoretical efforts to characterize the spectroscopic properties of the proposed derivatives, paving the way for their eventual identification in space.

 - **Abstract**
 Deuterated molecules can be used to study the physical conditions and the astro-chemical evolution of molecular clouds. large-sample surveys for deuterated molecules are needed to understand the enhancement of deuterated molecules from diffuse molecular gas to cold cores. A single-pointing survey toward the 559 Planck cold clumps of the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC) has been conducted using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-meter telescope, focusing on the $J$=1-0 transitions of DCO$^+$ and DCN. The survey included observations of 309 cores for DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 simultaneously, followed by 71 of these cores where DCO$^+$ 1-0 was detected for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously, aiming to determine the deuterated fraction ($D_{\rm frac}$). Additionally, 250 cores were observed for DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously. Among the 309 sources, DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 were detected in 79 and 11 sources, with a detection rates of 25.6 % and 3.6 % respectively. In the 250 sources observed for all four species, DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 were detected in 58, 9, 57 and 13 sources, with a detection rate of 23.2 %, 3.6 %, 22.8 % and 5.2 % respectively. The $D_{\rm frac}$(HCO$^+$) values in 112 sources range from 0.89 % to 7.4 % with a median value of 3.1 %, while $D_{\rm frac}$(HCN) values in 11 sources range from 1.5 % to 5.5 % with a median value of 2.3 %. The line widths of DCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0 detections are mostly within 1 km s$^{-1}$. The similarity in $D_{\rm frac}$ values between HCO$^+$ and HCN indicates that the higher detection rate of DCO$^+$ 1-0 compared with DCN 1-0 is due to the lower critical density of DCO$^+$ 1-0. We suggest that the enhancement of DCO$^+$ and DCN likely begins in the early diffuse stage of the molecular cloud, rather than during the cold core formation stage.
#### Response of the solar atmosphere to flux emergence: With emergence-driven prominence formation

 - **Abstract**
 Flux emergence is crucial for the formation of solar active regions and triggering of various eruptions. However, the detailed mechanisms by which flux emergence drives these eruptions remain unclear and require numerical investigation. Using 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the interaction between emerging flux and background magnetic fields and dynamics of the induced eruptions. By systematically varying the strength and angle of the emerging magnetic field relative to the background field, we investigate its impact on the initiation and evolution of solar eruptions. The simulations show that magnetic reconnection between the emerging flux and background field drives the formation of current sheets, magnetic islands and multithermal jets. Stronger magnetic fields result in earlier eruptions, more energetic jets, and enhanced heating. The formation and ejection of magnetic islands affect the structure and dynamics of the jet. When the hot and cool components of jets reach the other footpoint of magnetic loops, they will generate spicules near the transition region. Varying the angle between the emerging flux and the background field, we find that larger angles delay filament ascent and eruption timing but facilitate filament formation. Filaments form a hot shell and oscillate with a period of 10 minutes driven by periodic plasma ejections. Repetitive reconnection events inject cold plasma into the self-consistently formed filament channel, introducing a new prominence formation mechanism by flux-emergence-fed injection. Our analysis highlights the dynamic interplay between magnetic reconnection, plasma cooling and heating, and filament dynamics. These findings provide insights into solar eruptions and their observational signatures, emphasizing the role of multi-thermal structures in the corona.
#### Variability of the Faraday Rotation Measure in the Parsec-scale Jet of AGN 1633+382

 - **Abstract**
 We study the Faraday rotation measure (RM) variability of flat spectrum radio quasar 1633+382 on 5 epochs spanning from 2004 to 2008. We used 4 to 43~GHz VLBI polarization data from VLBA. Core RM across 4 to 15 GHz scales with a power index $a\sim2$, for $a$ in RM$\propto \nu^a$. We detected sign changes across epochs, both in the core and in the jet region. RM time variability in the core and jet region are not correlated, hence limiting the size of a possible Faraday screen. We relate the core RM variability to a new component emerging from the core region. For the jet region, we consider the jet-medium interaction to be a less likely cause of the RM variability because of the uniform spectral index distribution. The observed RM value variation requires a huge fluctuation in electron density or magnetic field, hence a foreground Faraday screen is less favoured. We further discuss other possibilities of the RM variability based on jet kinematics.

 - **Abstract**
 The nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) likely host clumpy clouds that occasionally obscure the central X-ray source, causing eclipse events. These events offer a unique opportunity to study the properties and origins of such clouds. However, these transient events are rarely reported due to the need for extensive, long-term X-ray monitoring for years. Here, we conduct a systematic search for eclipse events in 40 AGNs well-monitored by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) over the past 20 years, comprising a total of $\sim$11,000 observations. Our selection criteria rely on significant variations in X-ray flux and spectral shape. We identify 3 high-confidence events in 3 AGNs and 8 candidates in 6 AGNs, all in type I AGNs. The observed clouds have column densities of $N_{\rm H}~\sim$ (0.2 $-$ 31.2) $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and ionization degrees of log $\xi$ $\sim$ (-1.3 $-$ 2.2). For the 5 events with well-constrained duration, their distances from the central black hole range from (2.4 $-$ 179) $\times$ 10$^{4}$ $R_{\rm g}$, with 2 clouds near the dust sublimation zone, 2 farther out. Interestingly, we find tentative correlations between the cloud properties (i.e. ionization state and column density) and the black hole mass and mass accretion rate, implying their strong connection to the accretion process, potentially via outflows. Our study also demonstrates the potential of the new X-ray all-sky monitor, Einstein Probe, in providing more detection and physical constraints for such events.
#### Investigating the Upper Scorpius OB association with HERMES. I. The spectroscopic sample and 6D kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as Li-equivalent widths to identify >1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3 5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain" scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.
