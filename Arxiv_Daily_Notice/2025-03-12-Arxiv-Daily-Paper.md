 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we utilize photometric and kinematic data from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and the {\sc ASteCA} package to analyze the sparsely studied open clusters, King 2 and King 5. For King 2, we identify 340 probable members with membership probabilities exceeding 50\%. Its mean proper motion components are determined as $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-1.407 \pm 0.008, -0.863 \pm 0.012)$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and its limiting radius is derived as $6.94_{-1.06}^{+0.22}$ arcminutes based on radial density profiles. The cluster has an estimated age of $4.80 \pm 0.30$ Gyr, a distance of $6586 \pm 164$ pc, and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.25$ dex ($z = 0.0088$). We detect 17 blue straggler stars (BSSs) concentrated in its core, and its total mass is estimated to be $356 \pm 19~M_{\odot}$. The computed apex motion is $(A_o,~D_o) = (-142^\circ.61 \pm 0^\circ.08, -63^\circ.58 \pm 0^\circ.13)$. Similarly, King 5 consists of 403 probable members with mean proper motion components $(\mu_\alpha\cos\delta,~\mu_\delta) = (-0.291 \pm 0.005, -1.256 \pm 0.005)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and a limiting radius of $11.33_{-2.16}^{+5.45}$ arcminutes. The cluster's age is determined as $1.45 \pm 0.10$ Gyr, with a distance of $2220 \pm 40$ pc and a metallicity of $\text{[Fe/H]} = -0.15$ dex ($z = 0.0109$). We identify 4 centrally concentrated BSSs, and the total mass is estimated as $484 \pm 22~M_{\odot}$. The apex motion is calculated as $(A_o,~D_o) = (-115^\circ.10 \pm 0^\circ.09, -73^\circ.16 \pm 0^\circ.12)$. The orbital analysis of King 2 and King 5 indicates nearly circular orbits, characterized by low eccentricities and minimal variation in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. King 2 and King 5 reach maximum heights of $499 \pm 25$ pc and $177 \pm 2$ pc from the Galactic plane, respectively, confirming their classification as young stellar disc population.

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G >2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 >G >1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$CDM model predicts structure formation across a vast mass range, from massive clusters ($\sim10^{15}\,\text{M}_\odot$) to Earth-mass micro-haloes ($\sim 10^{-6} \, \text{M}_\odot$), resolving which far exceeds the capabilities of current simulations. Excursion set models are the most efficient theoretical tool to disentangle this hierarchy in mass. We test the excursion set paradigm by combining smoothed initial density fields with a "perfect" collapse model -- $N$-body simulations. We find that a core excursion set assumption -- small-scale perturbations do not impact larger-scale collapse -- is approximately fulfilled but exhibits small quantitative violations dependent on the smoothing filter. For a sharp $k-$space cut-off $\sim 20\%$ of mass elements revert collapse as the smoothing scale decreases, while only $3.5\%$ do for a Gaussian and $5\%$ for a top-hat. Further, we test the simple deterministic mass-mapping $M \propto R^3$ (first-crossing scale to halo mass) relation. We find that particles that are first accreted into haloes at the same smoothing scale may end up in haloes of significantly different masses, with a scatter of 0.4-0.8 dex. We also demonstrate that the proportionally constant of this relation should be considered as a degree of freedom. Finally, we measure the mass fraction in different structure morphologies (voids, pancakes, filaments and haloes) as a function of filter scale. Typical particles appear to be part of a large-scale pancake, a smaller-scale filament and a notably smaller halo. We conclude that validating predictions of excursion set models on a particle-by-particle basis against simulations may enhance their realism.
#### On the Origin of Abundance Variations in the Milky Way's High-$α$ Plateau

 - **Abstract**
 Using multi-element abundances from the SDSS APOGEE survey, we investigate the origin of abundance variations in Milky Way (MW) disk stars on the "high-$\alpha$ plateau," with $-0.8\leq\rm{[Fe/H]}\leq-0.4$ and $0.25\leq\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\leq0.35$. The elevated [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios of these stars imply low enrichment contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), but it is unclear whether their abundance patterns reflect pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) enrichment. We find that plateau stars with higher [Fe/Mg] ratios also have higher [X/Mg] ratios for other iron-peak elements, suggesting that the [Fe/Mg] variations in the plateau population do reflect variations in the SNIa/CCSN ratio. To quantify this finding, we fit the observed abundance patterns with a two-process model, calibrated on the full MW disk, which represents each star's abundances as the sum of a prompt CCSN process with amplitude $A_{\text{cc}}$ and a delayed SNIa process with amplitude $A_{\text{Ia}}$. This model is generally successful at explaining the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$, which are steeper for elements with a large SNIa contribution (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mn) and flatter for elements with low SNIa contribution (e.g., O, Si, Ca). Our analysis does not determine the value of [Mg/Fe] corresponding to pure CCSN enrichment, but it should be at least as high as the upper edge of the plateau at $\rm{[Mg/Fe]}\approx0.35$, and could be significantly higher. Compared to the two-process predictions, the observed trends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\text{Ia}}/A_{\text{cc}}$ are steeper for (C+N) but shallower for Ce, providing intriguing but contradictory clues about AGB enrichment in the early disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical properties of stellar atmospheres in rapidly rotating massive stars, such as Be stars, are critical to understanding their evolution and their role as progenitors of supernovae. These stars, which often have near-critical rotation, exhibit equatorial stretching and gravity darkening, which significantly complicates the determination of parameters such as the inclination angle. Be stars, characterized by their extreme rotational velocities, serve as excellent candidates for exploring these phenomena. However, fundamental quantities such as polar and equatorial radii and inclination angles are typically derived from interferometry, which applies only to a limited number of stars. This study aims to enhance the determination of inclination angles for Be stars using the ZPEKTR spectral synthesis code. By incorporating advanced models of gravity darkening and stellar deformation, we evaluated the effectiveness of this method with a sample of ten Be stars from the BeSOS database, comparing results with established interferometric data. Methods. We used the ZPEKTR code to model the effects of stellar oblateness and gravity darkening on spectral lines, focusing on the HeI 4471 line. We applied a chi-squared test minimization approach to identify the best-fitting models, and we evaluated the inclination angles derived against interferometric measurements. Our analysis reveals a robust linear correlation between the inclination angles derived from ZPEKTR and using interferometric techniques, which demonstrates an excellent agreement. The ZPEKTR code effectively models high rotational velocity effects, providing precise stellar parameter determinations. The results underscore the potential of advanced spectroscopic techniques to yield inclination measurements comparable to interferometry, which offers a pathway to studying distant massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The identification of star clusters holds significant importance in studying galaxy formation and evolution history. However, the task of swiftly and accurately identifying star clusters from vast amounts of photometric images presents an immense challenge. To address these difficulties, we employ deep learning models for image classification to identify young disk star clusters in M31 from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) images. For training, validation, and testing, we utilize the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey catalogs. We evaluate the performance of various deep learning models, using different classification thresholds and limiting magnitudes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet-50 model exhibits the highest overall accuracy. Moreover, using brighter limiting magnitudes and increasing the classification thresholds can effectively enhance the accuracy and precision of cluster identification. Through our experiments, we found that the model achieves optimal performance when the limiting magnitude is set to brighter than 21 mag. Based on this, we constructed a training dataset with magnitudes less than 21 mag and trained a second ResNet-50 model. This model achieved a purity of 89.30%, a recall of 73.55%, and an F1 score of 80.66% when the classification threshold was set to 0.669. Applying the second model to all sources in the PAndAS fields within a projected radius of 30 kpc from the center of M31, we identified 2,228 new unique star cluster candidates. We conducted visual inspections to validate the results produced by our automated methods, and we ultimately obtained 1,057 star cluster candidates, of which 745 are newly identified.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a key to understanding the mass inflow and outflow of compact objects. Spectral lines carry information about the ionization, density, and velocity structures through their intensity ratios and profiles. They are formed in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions under the intense radiation field from the compact objects, thus radiative transfer (RT) calculation is a requisite for proper interpretations. We present such a study for a low-mass X-ray binary, Circinus X-1, from which the P Cygni profile was discovered using the X-ray grating spectrometer onboard Chandra. We observed the source using the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard XRISM at an orbital phase of 0.93-0.97 and revealed many spectral features unidentified before; the higher series transitions (n to 1; n > 2) of highly-ionized (H- and He-like) S, Ca, Ar, and Fe in emission and absorption, the Fe K{\alpha} and K\b{eta} inner-shell excitation absorption of mildly-ionized (O- to Li-like) Fe, and resolved fine-structure level transitions in the Fe Ly{\alpha} and He{\alpha} complexes. They blend with each other at different velocity shifts on top of apparently variable continuum emission that changed its flux by an order of magnitude within a 70 ks telescope time. Despite such complexity in the observed spectra, most of them can be explained by a simple model consisting of the photoionized plasma outflowing at ~300 km s-1 and the variable blocking material in the line of sight of the incident continuum emission from the accretion disk. We demonstrate this with the aid of the RT code cloudy for the line ratio diagnostics and spectral fitting. We further constrain the physical parameters of the outflow and argue that the outflow is launched close to the outer edge of the accretion disk and can be driven radiatively by being assisted by the line force calculated using the RT simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 OB stars are crucial for our understanding of Galactic structure, star formation, stellar feedback and multiplicity. In this paper we have compiled a census of all OB stars within 1 kpc of the Sun. We performed evolutionary and atmospheric model fits to observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) compiled from astro-photometric survey data. We have characterized and mapped 24,706 O- and B-type stars ($T_{\rm eff} > 10,000$ K) within 1 kpc of the Sun, whose overdensities correspond to well-studied OB associations and massive star-forming regions such as Sco-Cen, Orion OB1, Vela OB2, Cepheus and Circinus. We have assessed the quality of our catalogue by comparing it with spectroscopic samples and similar catalogues of OB(A) stars, as well as catalogues of OB associations, star-forming regions and young open clusters. Finally, we have also exploited our list of OB stars to estimate their scale height (76 $\pm$ 1 pc), a local star formation rate of $2896^{+417}_{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ and a local core-collapse supernova rate of $\sim$15--30 per Myr. We extrapolate these rates to the entire Milky Way to derive a Galactic SFR of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a core-collapse supernova rate of 0.4--0.5 per century. These are slightly lower than previous estimates, which we attribute to improvements in our census of OB stars and changes to evolutionary models. We calculate a near-Earth core collapse supernova rate of $\sim$2.5 per Gyr that supports the view that nearby supernova explosions could have caused one or more of the recorded mass extinction events on Earth.

 - **Abstract**
 Several planet formation models have been proposed to explain the gap in the population of planets between $1.8$ $R_\oplus$ to $2.0$ $R_\oplus$ known as the Radius Valley. To apply these models to confirmed exoplanets, accurate and precise host star and planet parameters are required to ensure the observed measurements correctly match model predictions. Previous studies have emphasized the need for a larger, more precise sample to further confirm dominant formation processes. By enhancing standard SED (Spectral Energy Distribution) fitting using Bayesian methods we derived highly accurate and precise host star and planet parameters. Specifically, we achieved median fractional uncertainties for stellar and planet radii of 2.4% and 3.4%, respectively. We then produced the largest, most precise sample to date of 1923 planets when compared to previous studies. This full sample, as well as a sampled filtered for host stellar masses between $0.8$ and $1.2$ $M_\odot$, are then used to derive the slope and position of the radius valley as a function of orbital period, insolation flux and stellar mass to compare them to predictive models and previous observational results. Our results are consistent with thermally-driven mass loss with a planet radius vs. orbital period slope of $-0.142$ $\pm0.006$ for the full sample leaning toward core-powered mass loss. The planet radius vs. insolation flux slope of $0.136$ $\pm0.014$ for the filtered sample leaned toward photoevaporation. Also, the slope as a function of stellar mass for both samples appear more consistent with thermally driven processes when compared to models and previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the astrophysical properties of a sample of star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). They have been selected with the aim of looking for the connection between their ages, heliocentric distances and metallicities with the existence of tidally perturbed/induced outermost SMC regions. We derived the star cluster fundamental parameters from relatively deep Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) DR2 color magnitude diagrams, cleaned from field star contamination, and compared to thousand synthetic CMDs covering a wide range of heliocentric distances, ages and metal content. Heliocentric distances for 15 star clusters are derived for the first time, which represents an increase of 50 per cent of SMC clusters with estimated heliocentric distances. The analysis of the age-metallicity relationships (AMRs) of cluster located in outermost regions distributed around the SMC and in the SMC Main Body reveals that they have followed the overall galaxy chemical enrichment history. However, since half of the studied clusters are placed in front of or behind the SMC Main Body, we concluded that they formed in the SMC and have traveled outward because of the tidal effects from the interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Furthermore, metal rich clusters formed recently in some of these outermost regions from gas that was also dragged by tidal effects from the inner SMC. This outcome leads to consider the SMC as a galaxy scarred by the LMC tidal interaction with distance-perturbed and newly induced outermost stellar substructures.
#### Birth of magnetized low-mass protostars and circumstellar disks

 - **Abstract**
 Although protostars and disks are often studied separately owing to numerical and observational challenges, breakthroughs in recent years have highlighted the need to study both objects in concert. The role of magnetic fields in this regard must be investigated. We aim to describe the birth of the protostar and that of its disk, as well as their early joint evolution following the second collapse. We wish to study the structure of the nascent star-disk system, while focusing on the innermost sub-AU region. We carry out high resolution 3D RMHD simulations, describing the collapse of dense cloud cores to stellar densities. The calculations reach $\approx 2.3$ yr after protostellar birth. Our simulations are also compared to their hydro counterpart to better isolate the role of magnetic fields. When accounting for ambipolar diffusion, the efficiency of magnetic braking is drastically reduced and the nascent protostar reaches breakup velocity, thus forming a rotationally supported disk. The diffusion of the magnetic field also allows for the implantation of a $\sim \mathrm{kG}$ field in the protostar, which is thereafter maintained. The magnetic field is mainly toroidal in the star-disk system, although a notable vertical component threads it. We also show that the nascent disk is prone to the MRI, although our resolution is inadequate to capture the mechanism. We note a sensitivity of the disk's properties with regards to the angular momentum inherited prior to the second collapse, as well as the magnetic field strength. These calculations carry multiple implications on several issues in stellar formation theory, and offer perspectives for future modeling of the system. Should the fossil field hypothesis to explain the origins of magnetic fields in young stellar objects hold, we show that a $\sim \mathrm{kG}$ field strength may be implanted and maintained in the protostar at birth.
