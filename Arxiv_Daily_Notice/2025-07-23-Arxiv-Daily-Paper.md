 - **Abstract**
 The extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) is a well-known feature observed in young and intermediate-age star clusters, characterized by a significant broadening of the main-sequence turn-off region. Although prolonged star formation and stellar rotation have been proposed as possible explanations, no consensus has yet been reached. Most previous studies have focused on high-mass clusters. In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass regime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from the VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO width in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a cluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon is also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width relations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show an eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape velocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of $88\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO. The consistent MSTO width measurements between the VISCACHA and HST photometries confirm the robustness of our method and demonstrate that the age spread determination is independent of the photometric system, showing also the power of ground-based observations to investigate the eMSTO phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems. For Solar-mass stars in the Galactic field, the distribution of orbital separations is log-normal over seven orders of magnitude, from $10^{-2} - 10^5$ au. In contrast, the separation distributions of systems in nearby star-forming regions paints a much more confusing picture. There appears to be an excess of systems in the separation range 10 - 1000 au, and recent high-resolution spectroscopic observations of close (<10 au) systems suggest a field-like distribution in some star-forming regions, but a possible excess with respect to the field in other regions. Furthermore, the resolution limit of numerical simulations of binary star formation is $\sim$1\,au, and consequently comparisons with the binary distributions in star-forming regions and in the field are restricted. In this paper, we demonstrate that these observational uncertainties, and limitations in the simulations, are potentially a much bigger problem than previously realised. We show that the log-normal separation distribution in the field can be reproduced by combining constituent binary populations whose initial separation distributions have a very different form to a log-normal. We also argue that the observed excess of binaries in the range 10 - 62 au in the ONC compared to the Galactic field is not necessarily inconsistent with the field population, because the ONC is only one of many star-forming regions that populate the field. We propose that further observations of spectroscopic binaries in star-forming regions to probe and complete the <10 au parameter space are urgently needed.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen/Helium-poor stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae with broad lines (SNe Ic-bl) almost always accompany the nearby ($z < 0.3$) jetted relativistic explosions known as long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the majority of SNe Ic-bl have no detected GRB counterpart. At least some of these SNe should harbor off-axis jets, whose afterglow may become detectable at late times, particularly at radio wavelengths. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations (rest frame times of $\sim 3$-$4\times10^{3}$ days post SN discovery) of a sample of 14 SNe Ic-bl discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) that have been demonstrated to originate from the same host environments as the SNe Ic-bl associated with nearby GRBs. Of the 14 SNe, we identify three that are radio detected, one of which (PTF10tqv, $z = 0.0795$) is consistent with an off-axis jet with energy similar to classical GRBs ($\gtrsim 10^{50.5}~$erg). Using recently developed synchrotron radiation code, we find that for our 11 non-detections, which are among the deepest limits obtained for Ic-bl, we rule out an off-axis jet with an energy of $\gtrsim 10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ in circumburst densities of $\gtrsim 10^{-1}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We predict that well-spaced monitoring of newly discovered SNe Ic-bl from $\sim 10~$days to $\sim 10~$years (rest frame) to luminosities of $\sim 10^{27}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}~{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ will constrain the existence of highly off-axis jets ($\gtrsim60^\circ$) with classical GRB energies. The VLA Sky Survey will probe jets that are $\lesssim 60^\circ$ off-axis, whereas the Deep Synpotic Array 2000 will probe jets out to $\sim 90^\circ$ off-axis, demonstrating the importance of utilizing radio surveys to supplement targeted observations.
#### GRB 241105A: A test case for GRB classification and rapid r-process nucleosynthesis channels

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful window to probe the progenitor systems responsible for the formation of heavy elements through the rapid neutron capture (r-) process, thanks to their exceptional luminosity, which allows them to be observed across vast cosmic distances. GRB 241105A, observed at a redshift of z = 2.681, features a short initial spike (1.5 s) and a prolonged weak emission lasting about 64 s, positioning it as a candidate for a compact binary merger and potentially marking it as the most distant merger-driven GRB observed to date. However, the emerging ambiguity in GRB classification necessitates further investigation into the burst's true nature. Prompt emission analyses, such as hardness ratio, spectral lag, and minimum variability timescales, yield mixed classifications, while machine learning-based clustering places GRB 241105A near both long-duration mergers and collapsar GRBs. We conducted observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for a potential supernova counterpart. Although no conclusive evidence was found for a supernova, the host galaxy's properties derived from the JWST observations suggest active star formation with low metallicity, and a sub-kpc offset of the afterglow from the host, which appears broadly consistent with a collapsar origin. Nevertheless, a compact binary merger origin cannot be ruled out, as the burst may plausibly arise from a fast progenitor channel. This would have important implications for heavy element enrichment in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars less massive than ~30 Msol evolve into a red supergiant after the main sequence. Given a standard IMF, this means about 80% of all single massive stars will experience this phase. RSGs are dominated by convection, with a radius that may extend up to thousands of solar radii. Their low temperature and gravity make them prone to lose large amounts of masses, either through a pulsationally-driven wind or through mass-loss outburst. RSGs are the progenitors of the most common core-collapse supernovae, the type II. In the present review, we give an overview of our theoretical understanding about this spectacular phase of massive stars evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The envelopes of Red Supergiants (RSGs) have a unique chemical environment not seen in other types of stars. They foster an oxygen-rich synthesis but are tempered by sporadic and chaotic mass loss, which distorts the envelope and creates complex outflow sub-structures consisting of knots, clumps, and arcs. Near the stellar photosphere, molecules and grains form under approximate LTE conditions, as predicted by chemical models. However, the complicated outflows appear to have distinct chemistries generated by shocks and dust destruction. Various RSG envelopes have been probed for their molecular content, mostly by radio and millimeter observations; however, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) and NML Cygni (NML Cyg) display the highest chemical complexity, and also the most complicated envelope structure. Thus far, over 29 different molecules have been identified in the envelopes of RSGs. Some molecules are common for circumstellar gas, including CO, SiO, HCN and H$_2$O, which have abundances of $\sim$$10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}$, relative to H$_2$. More exotic oxides have additionally been discovered, such as AlO, AlOH, PO, TiO$_2$, and VO, with abundances of $\sim$$10^{-9}$--$10^{-7}$. RSG shells support intricate maser emission in OH, H$_2$O and SiO, as well. Studies of isotope ratios in molecules suggest dredge-up at least into the H-burning shell, but further exploration is needed.
#### Red Supergiant Mass Loss and Mass-Loss Rates

 - **Abstract**
 This review discusses the causes, nature, importance and observational evidence of mass loss by red supergiants. It arrives at the perception that mass loss finds its origin in the gravity which makes the star a star in the first place, and is a mechanism for the star to equilibrate. This is corroborated by a careful examination of various popular historical and recent empirical mass-loss rate prescriptions and theoretical works, and which provides no evidence for an explicit dependence of red supergiant mass loss on metallicity though dust-associated mass loss becomes less prevalent at lower metallicity. It also identifies a common problem in methods that use tracers of mass loss, which do not correct for varying scaling factors (often because there is no information available on which to base such correction) and as a result tend to underestimate mass-loss rates at the lower end. Conversely, dense, extended chromospheres in themselves do not translate into high mass-loss rates, and the significance of stochastic mass loss can be overstated. On a population scale, on the other hand, binary interaction acts as a stochastic agent of mass loss of great import. In all, evidence is overwhelming that points at red supergiants at the lower mass end losing mass at insufficient rates to shed their mantles before core collapse, but massive (at birth) red supergiants to be prone to intense, dusty mass loss which sees them become hotter stars before meeting their fate. This is consistent with the identified progenitors of hydrogen-rich supernovae. Supernova evolution holds great promise to probe the mass loss but we caution against confusing atmospheres with winds. Finally, promising avenues are looked into, which could forge step-change progress in what has been a long and arduous search for the holy grail of red supergiant mass loss. We may yet find it!
#### Red Supergiants as Supernova Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 The inevitable fate of massive stars in the initial mass range of ~8--30 M_{Sun} in the red supergiant (RSG) phase is a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion, although some stars may collapse directly to a black hole. We know that this is the case, since RSGs have been directly identified and characterized for a number of supernovae (SNe) in pre-explosion archival optical and infrared images. RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar matter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some RSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes. The SNe from RSGs are hydrogen-rich Type II-Plateau (II-P), and SNe II-P at the low end of the luminosity range tend to arise from low-luminosity RSGs. The typical spectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a cool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more luminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to account for their SEDs. The SN II-P progenitor luminosity range is log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 4.0--5.2. The fact RSGs are known up to log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 5.7 leads to the so-called ``RSG problem'', which may, in the end, be a result of small number of available statistics to date.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of TeV neutrino sources by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory demonstrates the detector's advanced capabilities in detecting high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. At lower energies, down to the GeV range, a variety of transient phenomena, such as novae, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts, are expected to emit neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos can provide unique insights into processes below the photosphere and offer clues to identifying their emission mechanisms. We have searched for these neutrinos intensively with IceCube's existing infill array, DeepCore. Although no significant detections have been made, strong constraints on astrophysical environments in these transients, such as the baryon loading factor in gamma-ray bursts, have been obtained. A denser infill array, called the IceCube Upgrade, will enhance sub-TeV neutrino searches with its unprecedented sensitivity to GeV neutrinos. The Upgrade, set to be deployed in the 2025-2026 South Pole season, will consist of seven new strings, adding approximately 700 novel optical modules with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the DeepCore volume. The denser arrangement of high-efficiency modules will significantly improve IceCube's sensitivity between 1 GeV and 1 TeV. We present an initial assessment of the astrophysical capabilities of the IceCube Upgrade, using preliminary simulated data and an event selection similar to that used for DeepCore. We explore the detectability of GeV neutrino transients compared to DeepCore and discuss potential sensitivity enhancements through advanced detector simulations and optimized analysis techniques, including refined triggering conditions and event selection criteria.

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the early-time estimation and late-time observation on the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding problem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs) have largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of these baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the partitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is sensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution with feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates how feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic structures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web method to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments, sheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba affect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that in Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only a few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces noticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the diffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a new perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined data model for the FRB foreground mapping.

 - **Abstract**
 The chemical evolution history of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is complex and is best understood through a comprehensive analysis of star clusters across its various regions. The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical evolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from an existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and most metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation (AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex in metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major merger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in the Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have experienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our previous works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of wing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned merger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the clouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge formations. In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample that includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the expectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show a trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models that best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with the major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we suggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters, which can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic chemical enrichment over time.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes are small planets between the size of the Earth and Neptune. The orbital and bulk properties of transiting sub-Neptunes can provide clues for their formation and evolution of small planets. In this paper, we report on follow-up observations of a planetary system around the mid-M dwarf TOI-654, whose transiting sub-Neptune TOI-654 b ($P=1.53$ day) is validated as a suitable target for the atmospheric observation. We measure the planetary mass and stellar properties with the InfraRed Doppler instrument (IRD) mounted on the Subaru telescope and obtain the stellar and planetary properties from additional transit observations by the Transit Exoplanetary Survey Satellite (TESS) and a series of the Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT). As a result, the planetary mass of TOI-654 b is determined to be $M_{\rm p} = 8.71 \pm 1.25 M_{\oplus}$, and the radius is updated to be $R_{\rm p} = 2.378 \pm 0.089 R_{\oplus}$. The bulk density suggests that the planet is composed of a rocky and volatile-rich core or a rocky core surrounded by a small amount of H/He this http URL-654 b is one of unique planets located around the radius valley and and also on the outer edge of the Neptune desert. The precise mass determination enables us to constrain the atmospheric properties with future spectroscopic observations especially for the emission by the James Webb Space Telescope and Ariel.

 - **Abstract**
 The Challan instrument is a solar full-disk imaging spectroscopic telescope planned to be installed at three sites with a 120-degree longitudinal difference, enabling continuous 24-hour observations of the Sun. It will take data every 2.5 min with a spatial resolution of $2-3^{\prime\prime}$ and a spectral resolving power (R) of >43,000 in H$\alpha$ and Ca II 854.2 nm bands simultaneously. Challan is composed of two modules, each dedicated to a specific waveband. This modular design is beneficial in minimizing the scattered light and simplifying the structure and engineering. The primary scientific goal of Challan is to investigate solar flares and filament eruptions. It is also expected to detect small-scale events in the solar chromosphere. In 2025, Challan will be installed at the Big Bear Solar Observatory for test observational runs, followed by scientific runs in 2026.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a hierarchical process ranging from molecular clouds down to individual protostars. In particular how infalling asymmetric structures, called streamers, delivering new material onto protostellar systems, are connected to the surrounding envelope is not understood. We investigate the connection between the cloud material at 10000 au scales down to 300 au scales towards L1448N in the Perseus star-forming region hosting three young Class 0/I protostellar systems. Sensitive molecular line observations taken with the IRAM 30m telescope and NOEMA at 1.4 mm are used to study the kinematic properties in the region traced by the molecular lines. Several infalling streamers are associated with the protostellar systems, some of them traced by C18O and DCN, while one of them is bright in SO and SO2. The kinematic properties of the former streamers are consistent with the velocities observed at large envelope scales of 10000 au, while the latter case show different kinematics. The masses and infall rates of the streamers are 0.01 Msun and 0.01-0.1 Msun and 10^-6 Msun/yr and 5-18x10^-6 Msun/yr for IRS3A and IRS3C, respectively. The envelope mass in the L1448N region is ~16Msun, thus the mass of a single streamer is low compared to the envelope mass (<1%). However, compared to the estimated mass of the protostellar systems a single streamer could deliver up to 1% and 8-17% of mass towards IRS3A (M*~1.2 Msun) and IRS3C (M*~1 Msun), respectively. The rotational signatures of structures in L1448N are all connected - from the large-scale envelope, infalling streamers, down to the rotation of all three disks. Two of the three Class 0/I protostellar systems are still fed by this surrounding material, which can be associated to the remnant envelope. However, we also find a streamer that is bright in SO and SO2 towards IRS3C that could be connected to a nearby sulfur reservoir.

 OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 is an isolated black hole of ~7 solar masses at a distance of 1.5 kpc identified thanks to the astrometric microlensing technique. It is the first specimen discovered of the large population of ~10^8 stellar-mass black holes that are believd to wander in the Galaxy. Electromagnetic radiation powered by accretion from the interstellar medium is expected from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, but has not been detected at any wavelength. We present the results of a deep pointed observation with the Chandra satellite that provides an upper limit of 3x10^29 erg/s on the luminosity of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 in the 0.5-7 keV energy range. This is about one order of magnitude below the previous limit obtained from shallower observations that serendipitously covered the sky position of this black hole. Our results are briefly compared with models of the source and with the X-ray upper limits for candidate isolated black holes and black holes in wide binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory has published properties of the 100 highest-energy cosmic ray events (to energies above 100 EeV) which it recorded over a 17 year period. We have examined the directional properties of these events and have taken particular note of the most energetically extreme events. We find that the most energetic events have directions which are grouped in a non-random way at the 1\% level. There is an apparent clustering in a limited region of the sky. Close to that direction is found Centaurus A, which has long been considered as a source of such particles, but we also note that a close-by dwarf galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is closer in angular terms. We examine the possibility that the LMC might be a source of observed cosmic rays at the highest energies.

 - **Abstract**
 We review recent advances in multimessenger astrophysics, with particular emphasis on Centaurus A and on two pivotal events: the gravitational-wave detection GW 170817 and the ultra-high-energy neutrino KM3-230213A. Centaurus A is the prototype multimessenger source. The GW 170817 event, arising from a binary neutron star merger, marked a transformative moment in astronomy through the joint observation of gravitational waves and a broad spectrum of electromagnetic signals. The KM3-230213A neutrino, detected by the KM3NeT Collaboration, is the most energetic neutrino observed to date and poses significant challenges for current models, given its tension with null results from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We assess astrophysical interpretations, including galactic, cosmogenic, and transient extragalactic sources, as well as implications for cosmic-ray acceleration. These cases underscore the scientific potential of high-energy multimessenger events in probing both the extreme universe and new physics.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on NICER X-ray observations of the Be X-ray binary A 0538-66 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Fast pulsations (69 ms) in this source were discovered in 1980 during a bright outburst in which it reached a luminosity of ~8E38 erg/s, but were never reobserved since then. We clearly detected the pulsations at P=69.3055 +/- 0.0005 ms with a pulsed fraction of ~20% during a short time interval (~11 minutes) on 2023 January 9, when A 0538-66 had a luminosity of ~8E36 erg/s (0.3-10 keV). The pulsations were not detected in other NICER observations (total exposure ~162.7 ks), during which A 0538-66 had a similar or lower luminosity. On 2023 February 8-9 the source exhibited a strong variability, with short flares reaching ~1E38 erg/s, but no periodic pulsations were detected. Assuming the magnetospheric radius lies within the corotation radius during pulsations, we estimate the neutron star magnetic field is below ~2.7E10 G. This would make A 0538-66 the high-mass X-ray binary with the weakest known magnetic field. We discuss implications for magnetic field evolution in accreting pulsars and propose that, alternatively, A 0538-66 has a stronger magnetic field and during the NICER detection, a centrifugal barrier may have been active while part of the plasma accumulated at the magnetosphere sporadically leaked through it via an instability mechanism, allowing accretion onto the polar caps.

 - **Abstract**
 Newborn pulsars resulting from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are promising sources of high-energy (HE) cosmic rays and neutrinos. In this work, we focus on HE neutrinos generated by interactions between protons accelerated in relativistic pulsar winds and SN ejecta. Using a binned likelihood analysis, we evaluate the detection prospects of these neutrinos with IceCube and explore their potential for probing the initial spin period ($P$) and magnetic field strength ($B$) of newborn pulsars. Noticing a degeneracy in neutrino signal with $B/P^2$ across a broad parameter space, we find that HE neutrinos from a galactic newborn pulsar ($d=10$ kpc) with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.003$ can be detected at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ significance. Even in the absence of a nearby pulsar, the diffuse flux from the cosmologic population of pulsars could be probed by next-generation detectors like IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND200k. For galactic pulsars with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.08$, the combination $B/P^2$ can be measured with an accuracy of better than 20\% at the $3\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we show that for pulsars with detectable HE neutrino signals, the emission can be clearly distinguished from neutrinos produced by interactions between SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium, due to their distinct temporal and spectral features.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminosity function and event rate of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are easily biased by the instrument and selection effects. We select 115 Fermi/GBM GRBs with good spectra fitted by a smoothly broken power-law function. The $\tau$-statistic method is used to describe how the luminosity evolves with redshift. The non-parametric Lynden-Bell's c$^{-}$ method has been applied to get the cumulative luminosity function and event rate which is compared with the star formation history. How the selection and instrument effects bias the deduced event rate has been carefully studied. We find that the event rate always exceeds the star formation rate (SFR) at lower redshift and matches with each other at higher redshift, which is independent of energy bands and consistent with previous findings of other satellites. Furthermore, it is found that sample completeness does not affect the deduced event rate too much as mentioned for the Swift lGRBs in Dong et al.. A triple power-law function has been used to fit the cumulative flux distribution and categorize the total sample into three subsamples of bright, medium and faint GRBs. We find that the event rates of bright GRBs, unlike medium and faint ones, comply with the SFR ideally, which indicates that these bright GRBs with higher luminosity are possibly produced from the core-collapse of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations in the Galaxy and nearby spirals have established that the HI-to-H$_2$ transition at solar metallicity occurs at gas weight of $P_{\rm DE}/k_B\approx 10^4 \ \rm K \ cm ^{-3}$, similar to solar neighbourhood conditions. Even so, state-of-the-art models of a self-regulated interstellar medium underproduce the molecular fraction ($R_{\rm mol}\equiv M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm HI}$) at solar neighbourhood conditions by a factor of $\approx2-4$. We use the GHOSDT suite of simulations at a mass resolution range of $100-0.25\ M_{\odot}$ (effective spatial resolution range of $\sim 20-0.05\ \rm pc$) run for 500 Myr to show how this problem is affected by modeling choices such as the inclusion of photoionizing radiation, assumed supernova energy, numerical resolution, inclusion of magnetic fields, and including a model for sub-grid clumping. We find that $R_{\rm mol}$ is not converged even at a resolution of 1 $M_{\odot}$, with $R_{\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of 2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\ M_{\odot}$. Models excluding either photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in $R_{\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\rm mol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\rm mol}$ by a factor of $\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the time-averaged $R_{\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle value, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable to the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals. Our findings show that small-scale clumping in the ISM plays a significant role in H$_2$ formation even in high-resolution numerical simulations.
#### Considering contact forces during the formation of planetesimals by gravitational collapse: mutual orbits, spin states, and shapes

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we apply a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) within the PKDGRAV N-body integrator to investigate the formation of planetesimal systems through the gravitational collapse of clouds of super-particles. Previously published numerical models have demonstrated that the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds is an efficient pathway to produce binary planetesimal systems. However, such investigations were limited by their use of a perfect-merger and inflated-radii super-particle approach, which inhibits any analysis of planetesimal shapes and spin states, precludes the formation of the tightest binary orbits, and produces significantly under-dense planetesimals. The SSDEM enables super-particles to rest upon each other through mutual surface penetration and by simulating contact physics. Super-particles do not need to be inflated and collisions are not treated as perfect mergers; we can thus track the evolution of planetesimal shapes, spins, and tight binary orbits. We demonstrate that the SSDEM is an excellent method to model the collapse process, and is capable of producing many binary planetesimal systems from a single cloud. Our results confirm the findings of previously published perfect-merging models while also producing novel results about planetesimal spin and shape properties. Newly-formed planetesimals exhibit 10-hr rotation periods on average and can be characterized by a wide variety of shapes (spherical, oblate, top-shaped, flattened, egg-shaped, or prolate), with the most-massive planetesimals primarily forming as spheres and oblate-spheroids.
#### A double-degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay time to explain type Ia supernova SN 2020aeuh

 - **Abstract**
 I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion delay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare properties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia; all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.

 - **Abstract**
 We present centimeter continuum observations of seven high luminosity massive protostars and their surroundings as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. With data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyze the spectral index, morphology and multiplicity of the detected radio sources. The high sensitivity and high resolution observations allow us to resolve many sources. We report thirteen new detections and two previously known detections that we observed for the first time in radio frequencies. We use the observations to build radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to calculate spectral indices. With radio morphologies and the spectral indices, we give assessments on the nature of the sources, highlighting five sources that display a radio jet-like morphology and a spectral index consistent with ionized jets. Combining with the SOMA Radio I sample, we present the radio - bolometric luminosity relation, especially probing the regime from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^4$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$. Here we find a steep rise in radio luminosity, which is expected by models that transition from shock ionization to photoionization.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf planetary systems uniquely link the bulk elemental composition of exoplanetary material to the mineralogy as photospheric abundances can be compared to circumstellar dust mineralogy. This study re-examines Spitzer/IRS spectra of eight white dwarfs with both circumstellar dust and photospheric metals. All systems show 10$\mu$m silicate emission features consistent with a mixture of olivine and pyroxene silicates, with varying dominance. New Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of two of these systems, GD56 and WD1150-153, reveal that both are accreting dry, rocky material. WD1150-153 is accreting material consistent with Bulk Earth, while GD56 is accreting core-rich material with an inferred core mass fraction of 0.59$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (0.37$^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ by mole). A comparison between the bulk elemental composition of the accreted planetary material and the dust mineralogy of the eight systems reveals a tentative correlation between the dominant silicate mineralogy and the Mg/Si ratio, indicating that the circumstellar and photospheric material are compositionally similar. This suggests that rapid and well-mixed accretion is occurring with minimal compositional alteration. Furthermore, new GGCHEM equilibrium chemistry models confirm that Mg-rich planetary material preferentially forms olivine-rich dust, highlighting the importance of equilibrium in planetary chemistry and that a host star or rock's Mg/Si can be used to predict whether its silicate mineralogy is olivine- or pyroxene-dominated, influencing its capacity to structurally store water, recycle key nutrients, and possibly habitability.
