 - **Abstract**
 The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.

 - **Abstract**
 The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a critical role in galaxy evolution, influencing gas flows, feedback processes, and galactic dynamics. Observations show a substantial cold gas reservoir in the CGM, but the mechanisms driving its formation and evolution remain unclear. Cosmic rays (CRs), as a source of non-thermal pressure, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of cold gas dynamics. This study explores how CRs affect cold clouds that condense from the hot CGM via thermal instability (TI). Using 3D CR-magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) simulations with AREPO, we assess the impact of various CR transport models on cold gas evolution. Under purely advective CR transport, CR pressure significantly suppresses the collapse of thermally unstable regions, altering the CGM's structure. In contrast, realistic CR transport models reveal that CRs escape collapsing regions via streaming and diffusion along magnetic fields, diminishing their influence on the thermal and dynamic structure of the cold CGM. The ratio of the CR escape time to the cloud collapse time emerges as a critical factor in determining the impact of CRs on TI. CRs remain confined within cold clouds when effective CR diffusion is slow which maximizes their pressure support and inhibits collapse. Fast effective CR diffusion, as realized in our 2-moment CRMHD model, facilitates rapid CR escape, reducing their stabilizing effect. This realistic CR transport model shows a wide dynamic range of the effective CR diffusion coefficient, ranging from $10^{29}$ to $10^{30}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$ for thermally- to CR-dominated atmospheres, respectively. In addition to these CR transport-related effects, we demonstrate that high numerical resolution is crucial to avoid spuriously large clouds formed in low-resolution simulations, which would result in overly long CR escape times and artificially amplified CR pressure support.

 - **Abstract**
 The first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era for the study of compact objects. Upcoming detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to add thousands of binary coalescences to the list. However, from a theoretical perspective, our understanding of compact objects is hindered by many uncertainties, and a comprehensive study of the nature of stellar remnants from core-collapse supernovae is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the properties of stellar remnants using a homogeneous grid of rotating and non-rotating massive stars at various metallicities from Limongi and Chieffi 2018. We simulate the supernova explosion of the evolved progenitors using the HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION (HYPERION) code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020), assuming a thermal bomb model calibrated to match the main properties of SN1987A. We find that the heaviest black hole that can form depends on the initial stellar rotation, metallicity, and the assumed criterion for the onset of pulsational pair-instability supernovae. Non-rotating progenitors at $\big[\rm Fe/H \big]=-3$ can form black holes up to $\sim 87 M_\odot$, falling within the theorized pair-instability mass gap. Conversely, enhanced wind mass loss prevents the formation of BHs more massive than $\sim 41.6 M_\odot$ from rotating progenitors. We use our results to study the black hole mass distribution from a population of $10^6$ isolated massive stars following a Kroupa initial mass function. Finally, we provide fitting formulas to compute the mass of compact remnants as a function of stellar progenitor properties. Our up-to-date prescriptions can be easily implemented in rapid population synthesis codes.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The circumnuclear disk (CND) is presently the main supply of mass for the accretion onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC). While the accretion is relatively slow, it has been suspected that local episodic explosive events play an important role in the temporary mass inflow toward the SMBH, while also affecting the evolution of the CND. Aims. The aim of this study is to follow the changes in mass flows caused by supernova (SN) explosions nestled in or near the CND. Methods. We perform simulations with the grid-based MHD code FLASH of the inner 5 pc of the Milky Way GC, including gravitational potential, rotation, magnetic field, central wind source, and the warm gas of the CND, all mimicking the observed physical properties. Results. Assuming a M$_\mathrm{SN}=10$ M$_\odot$ as the mass of the precursor of the core-collapse SN event at various locations within 2 pc from the GC, we detect a temporary increase in the accretion rate, transferring an additional 2-60 M$_\odot$ of warm gas to the immediate vicinity of the SMBH, depending on the explosion site. At the same time, the kinetic energy of the SN blows away even mass from the CND; the additional warm gas leaving the simulation domain after the explosion is on the order of $\sim100$ M$_\odot$. In the studied cases, the impact on mass flows and the turbulence caused by the explosion cease after $\sim250$ kyr.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary discs, when externally irradiated by Far Ultraviolet (FUV) photons from OBA-type stars, lose material through photoevaporative winds, reducing the amount of material available to form planets. Understanding the link between environmental irradiation and observed disc properties requires accurately evaluating the FUV flux at star-hosting discs, which can be challenging due stellar parallax uncertainties. In this paper, we address this issue proposing a novel approach: using the local density distribution of a star-forming region (i.e. 2D pairwise star separations distribution) and assuming isotropy, we infer 3D separations between star-hosting discs and massive stars. We test this approach on synthetic clusters, showing that it significantly improves the accuracy compared to previous methods. We compute FUV fluxes for a large sample of star-bearing discs in 7 regions within 200 pc, 6 regions in Orion, and Serpens sub-regions, providing a publicly accessible catalogue. We find that discs in regions hosting late-type B and early-type A stars can reach non-negligible irradiation levels for disc evolution (10-100 G0). We investigate dust disc masses relative to FUV fluxes detecting hints of a negative correlation when restricting to average region ages. However, we emphasize the need for more stellar and disc measurements at >10^2 G0 to probe the dependence of disc properties on the environmental irradiation. Including average interstellar dust extinction, median FUV fluxes are not significantly attenuated, though this result may change if high-resolution 3D dust extinction maps were available. The method presented in this work is a powerful tool that can be expanded to additional regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon stars (with atmospheric C/O$>1$) range widely in temperature and luminosity, from low mass dwarfs to asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB). The main sequence dwarf carbon (dC) stars have inherited carbon-rich material from an AGB companion, which has since transitioned to a white dwarf. The dC stars are far more common than C giants, but no reliable estimates of dC space density have been published to date. We present results from an all-sky survey for carbon stars using the low-resolution XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We developed and measured a set of spectral indices contrasting C$_{\rm 2}$ and CN molecular band strengths in carbon stars against common absorption features found in normal (C/O$<1$) stars such as CaI, TiO and Balmer lines. We combined these indices with the XP spectral coefficients as input to supervised machine-learning algorithms trained on a vetted sample of known C stars from LAMOST. We describe the selection of the carbon candidate sample, and provide a catalog of 43,574 candidates dominated by cool C giants in the Magellanic Clouds and at low galactic latitude in the Milky Way. We report the confirmation of candidate C stars using intermediate ($R\sim 1800$) resolution optical spectroscopy from the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, and provide estimates of sample purity and completeness. From a carefully-vetted sample of over 600 dCs, we measure their local space density to be $\rho_0\,=\,1.96^{+0.14}_{-0.12}\times10^{-6}\,\text{pc}^{-3}$ (about one dC in every local disk volume of radius 50\,pc), with a relatively large disk scale height of $H_z\,=\,856^{+49}_{-43}\,$pc.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new multi-wavelength observations of two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) hosted by globular clusters (GCs) in the giant elliptical NGC 1399, focusing on CXO J0338318-352604 (GCU7), only the second GC ULX known to have luminous optical emission lines. Notably, only NII and OIII emission is observed in the optical spectra, suggesting H-poor material. Previous work suggested the possibility that the properties of GCU7 could be explained by the tidal disruption of a horizontal branch star by an intermediate-mass black hole. We use new data to show that the lack of evolution in the X-ray or optical properties of the source over the last 20 years rules out this scenario. Instead, we use CLOUDY simulations to demonstrate that the optical emission lines are consistent with an outflow from an ultra-compact X-ray binary where a compact object - likely a neutron star (NS) - is accreting above the Eddington limit from a helium white dwarf (He WD). This binary would have dynamically formed from a direct collision between a NS and a red giant, or else via an exchange interaction. The ULX is predicted to evolve to lower mass transfer rates over time and eventually become a doppelganger to the well-studied ultra-compact X-ray binaries in Galactic GCs such as 4U 1820-30. These results show the utility of using extragalactic GCs to study short-lived phases in dynamical binary evolution that occur too rarely to be observed in Galactic clusters.
#### Intermediate-mass stars and the origin of the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation

 - **Abstract**
 The number of known planets around intermediate-mass stars (1.5 M$_{\odot}$ < M$_{\star}$ < 3.5 M$_{\odot}$) is rather low. We aim to test whether the correlation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant planets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In particular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation changes as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results confirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower metallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of intermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity correlation, although the differences in metal content between planet and non-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is significantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the red giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible with that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in the convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured metallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity correlation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a scenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material on the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the metallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the composition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops a sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is recovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet formation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk property of the star.

 - **Abstract**
 The first few hours of a supernova contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted to the Gran Telescopio de Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernova at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra for 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48 hours. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from ZTF and ATLAS. This programme shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme to existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the supernova candidate. Both the future La Silla Southern Supernova Survey (LS4) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) both located in Chile will be providing discovery and follow up of most of the transients in the southern hemisphere. This paper demonstrates that with a rapid spectroscopic programme and stringent triggering criteria, obtaining a sample of SN with spectra within a day of the explosion is possible.
