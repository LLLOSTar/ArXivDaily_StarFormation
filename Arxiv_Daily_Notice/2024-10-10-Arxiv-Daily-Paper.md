 - **Abstract**
 ALMA has detected substructures in numerous protoplanetary disks at radii from a few to over a hundred au. These substructures are commonly thought to be associated with planet formation, either by serving as sites fostering planetesimal formation or arising as a consequence of planet-disk interactions. Our current understanding of substructures, though, is primarily based on observations of nearby star-forming regions with mild UV environments, whereas stars are typically born in much harsher UV environments, which may inhibit planet formation in the outer disk through external photoevaporation. We present high resolution ($\sim8$ au) ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of eight disks in $\sigma$ Orionis, a cluster irradiated by an O9.5 star. Gaps and rings are resolved in the images of five disks. The most striking of these is SO 1274, which features five gaps that appear to be arranged nearly in a resonant chain. In addition, we infer the presence of gap or shoulder-like structures in the other three disks through visibility modeling. These observations indicate that substructures robustly form and survive at semi-major axes of several tens of au or less in disks exposed to intermediate levels of external UV radiation as well as in compact disks. However, our observations also suggest that disks in $\sigma$ Orionis are mostly small and thus millimeter continuum gaps beyond a disk radius of 50 au are rare in this region, possibly due to either external photoevaporation or age effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding binary black hole (BBH) dynamics in dense star clusters is key to interpreting the gravitational wave detections by LIGO and Virgo. Here, we perform $N$-body simulations of star clusters, focusing on BBH formation mechanisms, dynamical evolution and merging properties. We explore a wide parameter space of initial conditions, with cluster masses ranging from $10^{4}$ to $10^{6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, densities from $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-3}$, and up to $100\%$ of massive stars in binaries. We show that most BBH mergers originate from the primordial binary population rather than being dynamically assembled, and that the evolution towards merger for most of these binaries is not significantly altered by dynamical encounters. As a result, the overall number of BBH mergers from the $N$-body simulations is nearly identical to that obtained when the same stellar population is evolved in isolation. Contrary to theoretical expectations, nearly all dynamically formed BBH mergers occur when the binary is still bound to its host cluster, with $\simeq 90\%$ of all dynamical mergers occurring within the cluster core region. In about half of these mergers the binary is part of a stable black hole-triple system. In one model, stellar mergers lead to the formation of a $\simeq 200\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ black hole, which then grows to $\simeq 300\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ through black hole mergers. Our study highlights the importance of detailed $N$-body simulations in capturing the evolution of black hole populations in dense clusters and challenges conclusions based on semi-analytical and Monte Carlo methods.

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) We explore the chemistry of the most abundant C, O, S, and N bearing species in molecular clouds, in the context of the IRAM 30 m Large Programme Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular Clouds (GEMS). In this work, we aim to assess the limitations introduced in the observational works when a uniform density is assumed along the line of sight for fitting the observations, developing a very simple numerical model of a turbulent box. We perform a MHD simulation in order to reproduce the turbulent steady-state of a turbulent box with properties typical of a molecular filament before collapse. We post-process the results of the MHD simulation with a chemical code to predict molecular abundances, and then post-process this cube with a radiative transfer code to create synthetic emission maps for a series of rotational transitions observed during the GEMS project. From the chemical point of view, we find that turbulence produces variations on the predicted abundances, but they are more or less critical depending on the chosen transition and the chemical age. When compared to real observations, the results from the turbulent simulation provides a better fit than when assuming a uniform gas distribution along the line of sight. In the view of our results, we conclude that taking into account turbulence when fitting observations might significantly improve the agreement with model predictions. This is especially important for sulfur bearing species that are very sensitive to the variations of density produced by turbulence at early times (0.1 Myr). The abundance of CO is also quite sensitive to turbulence when considering the evolution beyond a few 0.1 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of an extended very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source coincident with the locations of middle-aged (62.4~\rm kyr) pulsar PSR J0248+6021, by using the LHAASO-WCDA data of live 796 days and LHAASO-KM2A data of live 1216 days. A significant excess of \gray induced showers is observed both by WCDA in energy bands of 1-25~\rm TeV and KM2A in energy bands of $>$ 25~\rm TeV with 7.3 $\sigma$ and 13.5 $\sigma$, respectively. The best-fit position derived through WCDA data is R.A. = 42.06$^\circ \pm$ 0.12$^\circ$ and Dec. = 60.24$^\circ \pm $ 0.13$^\circ$ with an extension of 0.69$^\circ\pm$0.15$^\circ$ and that of the KM2A data is R.A.= 42.29$^\circ \pm $ 0.13$^\circ$ and Dec. = 60.38$^\circ \pm$ 0.07$^\circ$ with an extension of 0.37$^\circ\pm$0.07$^\circ$. No clear extended multiwavelength counterpart of this LHAASO source has been found from the radio band to the GeV band. The most plausible explanation of the VHE \gray emission is the inverse Compton process of highly relativistic electrons and positrons injected by the pulsar. These electrons/positrons are hypothesized to be either confined within the pulsar wind nebula or to have already escaped into the interstellar medium, forming a pulsar halo.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that dense molecular filamentary clouds are sites of star formation. The filament width determines the fragmentation scale and influences the stellar mass. Therefore, understanding the evolution of filaments and the origin of their properties is important for understanding star formation. Although observations show a universal width of 0.1 pc, theoretical studies predict the contraction of thermally supercritical filaments (> 17 Msun pc-1) due to radial collapse. Through non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we explore the formation and evolution of filaments via slow-shock instability at the front of accretion flows. We reveal that ambipolar diffusion allows the gas in the filament to flow across the magnetic fields around the shock, forming dense blobs behind the concave points of the shock. The blobs transfer momentum that drives internal turbulence. We name this mechanism the "STORM" (Slow-shock-mediated Turbulent flOw Reinforced by Magnetic diffusion). The persistence and efficiency of the turbulence inside the filament are driven by the magnetic field and the ambipolar diffusion effect, respectively. The STORM sustains the width even when the filament reaches very large line masses (~ 100 Msun pc-1).

 - **Abstract**
 Context: A new generation of instruments (e.g., JWST, ELTs, PLATO, Ariel) is providing atmospheric spectra and mass/radius measurements for large exoplanet populations, challenging planetary models used to interpret these findings. Aims: We develop a new model, the Heat Atmosphere Density Evolution Solver (HADES), by coupling an atmosphere and interior model self-consistently and comparing its results to observed data. Methods: Atmospheric calculations are performed under radiative-convective equilibrium, while the interior relies on recent ab initio equations of state. We ensure continuity in the thermal, gravity, and molecular mass profiles between models. Results: The model is applied to the known exoplanet database to characterize intrinsic thermal properties. We find that intrinsic temperatures (T$_{int}$) of 200-400 K, increasing with equilibrium temperature, are needed to explain radius inflation in hot Jupiters. Additionally, we perform atmosphere-interior retrievals using observed spectra and measured parameters for WASP-39 b and 51 Eridani b. For WASP-39 b, spectroscopic data breaks degeneracies in metallicity and Tint, deriving high values: Z = 14.79$^{+1.80}_{-1.91}$ x Solar and T$_{int} = 297.39^{+8.95}_{-16.9}$ K. For 51 Eridani b, we show the importance of using self-consistent models with radius as a constrained parameter, deriving a planet mass M$_{p} = 3.13^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_{J}$ and a core mass M$_{core} = 31.86^{+0.32}_{-0.18}$ M$_{E}$, suggesting formation via core accretion with a "hot start." Conclusions: Self-consistent atmosphere-interior models can efficiently break degeneracies in the structure of transiting and directly imaged exoplanets, offering new insights into exoplanet formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the EXES instrument on SOFIA, we have obtained velocity-resolved spectra of several pure rotational lines of H2 toward shocked molecular gas within three Galactic sources: the supernova remnant (SNR) IC443 (Clump C), a protostellar outflow in the intermediate-mass star-forming region NGC 2071, and the SNR 3C391. These observations had the goal of searching for expected velocity shifts between ortho- and para-H2 transitions emitted by C-type shocks. In contrast in our previous similar study of HH7, the result of our search was negative: no velocity shifts were reliably detected. Several possible explanations for the absence of such shifts are discussed: these include a preshock ortho-to-para ratio that is already close to the high-temperature equilibrium value of 3 (in the case of IC443C), the more complex shock structures evident in all these sources, and the larger projected aperture sizes relative to those in the observations of HH7.

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance of helium ($A_{He}$) in the solar wind exhibits variations typically in the range from 2-5% with respect to solar cycle activity and solar wind velocity. However, there are instances where the observed $A_{He}$ is exceptionally low ($<$ 1%). These low-$A_{He}$ occurrences are detected both near the Sun and at 1 AU. The low $A_{He}$ events are generally observed near the heliospheric current sheet. We analyzed 28 low-$A_{He}$ events observed by the Wind spacecraft and 4 by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to understand their origin. In this work, we make use of the ADAPT-WSA model to derive the sources of our events at the base of the solar corona. The modeling suggests that the low-$A_{He}$ events originated from the boundaries of coronal holes, primarily from large quiescent helmet streamers. We argue that the cusp above the core of the streamer can produce such very low helium abundance events. The streamer core serves as an ideal location for gravitational settling to occur as demonstrated by previous models, leading to the release of this plasma through reconnection near the cusp, resulting in low $A_{He}$ events. Furthermore, observations from Ulysses provide direct evidence that these events originated from coronal streamers.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of dark matter annihilation on the 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization (EoR). Using modified 21cmFAST simulations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we investigate how energy injected into the intergalactic medium (IGM) through dark matter annihilation affects the evolution of the 21-cm differential brightness temperature. Focusing on two annihilation channels, photon-photon ($\gamma \gamma$) and electron-positron ($e^+e^-$), we examine a broad range of dark matter masses and annihilation cross-sections. Our results show that CNNs outperform traditional power spectrum analysis by effectively distinguishing between subtle differences in simulated 21-cm maps produced by annihilation and non-annihilation scenarios. We also demonstrate that the structure formation boost, driven by dark matter clumping into halos and subhalos, significantly enhances the annihilation signal and alters the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. This enhancement leads to a noticeable effect on the 21-cm signal, including a shift from absorption to emission as dark matter annihilation heats the IGM at lower redshifts. By incorporating observational noise from upcoming radio interferometers, particularly the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we show that these effects remain detectable despite observational challenges. We find that the dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal distinguishable from the non-annihilation scenarios for the dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-31}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ ($\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-32}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and $\langle \sigma v\rangle \simeq 10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=1$ TeV).
#### Constraining Planetary Albedo of JWST Targets in the TESS bandpass, using TESS, HST and Spitzer Eclipse Depth Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Albedo is one of the important characteristics of hot Jupiter exoplanets. However, albedo constraints have been obtained for very few exoplanets. In this work, we present the TESS Phase Curve observations of WASP-18b, WASP-19b, WASP-121b, WASP-43b, WASP-17b, and WASP-77b, all JWST targets for atmospheric characterization and constrain their occultation depth as well as geometric albedo (A$_g$). We use a grid of self-consistent model atmospheres to constrain the metallicity, C/O ratio, and heat re-distribution for these six targets by fitting to their HST and/or Spitzer observations and also compute the thermal contribution to total occultation depth in the TESS bandpass. We report the first value of TESS occultation depth for WASP-17b ($151_{-66}^{+83}$) and updated value for WASP-77Ab ($94_{-62}^{+53}$). We find self-consistent models constrain high values of thermal contribution to total occultation compared to Planck models. We find very low A$_g$ values for WASP-18b (< 0.089), WASP-19b (< 0.022), WASP-121b ($0.0^{+0.055}_{-0.104}$), WASP-77Ab ($0.017^{+0.126}_{-0.147}$) and significantly higher value for WASP-43b ($0.109^{+0.086}_{-0.088}$) and WASP-17b ($0.401^{+0.526}_{-0.307}$). We find WASP-17b lies in the ideal spot of low gravity and low equilibrium temperature, conducive for cloud formation, leading to high A$_g$. With the best-fit models, we constrain low heat re-distribution for all planets, with WASP-18b having the least. We also constrain sub-solar metallicity for all planets except WASP-17b and WASP-19b. We find a highly sub-solar C/O ratio for WASP-77Ab and WASP-43b, solar for WASP-18b, and super-solar for WASP-121b. The best-fit $P$-$T$ profiles show thermal inversion for WASP-18b and WASP-121b and none for WASP-77b and WASP-43b, which is in agreement with previous works.

 - **Abstract**
 Gas volume density is one of the critical parameters, along with dispersions in magnetic field position angles and non-thermal gas motions, for estimating the magnetic field strength using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) relation or through its modified versions for a given region of interest. We present VolDen an novel python-based algorithm to extract the number density map from the column density map for an elongated interstellar filament. VolDen uses the workflow of RadFil to prepare the radial profiles across the spine. The user has to input the column density map and pre-computed spine along with the essential RadFil parameters (such as distance to the filament, the distance between two consecutive radial profile cuts, etc.) to extract the radial column density profiles. The thickness and volume density values are then calculated by modeling the column density profiles with a Plummer-like profile and introducing a cloud boundary condition. The cloud boundary condition was verified through an accompanying N-PDF column density analysis. In this paper, we discuss the workflow of VolDen and apply it to two filamentary clouds. We chose LDN 1495 as our primary target owing to its nearby distance and elongated morphology. In addition, the distant filament RCW 57A is chosen as the secondary target to compare our results with the published results. Upon publication, a complete tutorial of VolDen and the codes will be available via GitHub.
#### 4D Grid-fitting of UV-optical spectra of massive stars. I. Numerical technique and its associated uncertainties

 - **Abstract**
 The best way to check the validity of our theories (models) is by direct comparison with the experiment (observations). In this study, we address the numerical inaccuracies intrinsic to the process of comparing theory and observations. To achieve this goal, we built 4D spectra grids for Wolf-Rayet stars (WC and WN spectral classes) and Blue Supergiants (BSGs) characterized by low metallicity similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Through rigorous testing on designated `test' models, we demonstrated that the numerical precision of derived stellar parameters (effective temperature, mass-loss rate, luminosity, and wind velocity) is not exceeding 0.05 dex. Moreover, the mean absolute deviation of the numerically derived stellar parameters is consistently below this threshold for objects with both weak (SMC grid) and strong winds (WC and WN grids), even in the presence of Gaussian noise. Furthermore, we explored the influence of unaccounted factors, including variations in the metal abundances, wind acceleration laws, and clumping, on the precision of the derived parameters. We found that the first two factors have the strongest influence on the numerical accuracy of the derived stellar parameters. Variations in abundances predominantly influenced the mass-loss rate for weak-wind scenarios, while effective temperature and luminosity remained robust. We found that the wind acceleration law influence the numerical uncertainty of the derived wind parameters mostly for models with weak winds. Interestingly, different degrees of clumping demonstrated good precision for spectra with strong winds, contrasting with a decrease in the precision for weak-wind cases. We found also that the accuracy of our approach depends on spectral range and the inclusion of ultraviolet spectral range improves the precision of derived parameters, especially for object with weak winds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a set of eight fallback simulations of zero-metallicity progenitors with masses between $60 M_\odot$ and $95 M_\odot$. The simulations are computed in 2D with the general relativistic CoCoNuT-FMT code for the first few seconds after black hole formation, and then mapped to the Newtonian code Prometheus for long-duration simulations beyond shock breakout. All simulations produce successful explosions with final energies ranging from $0.41 \times 10^{51}$ erg to $2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg and black hole masses from $20.7 M_\odot$ to $34.4 M_\odot$. Explosion energies and remnant masses do not vary monotonically with progenitor mass, but the mass cuts cluster near the outer edge of the helium core. A supplementary model with decreased neutrino heating provides a tentative indication that successful explosions require the shock to reach the sonic point in the infall profile by the time of black hole formation. The propagation of the shock to the surface is only approximately captured by proposed shock invariants, but these may still be sufficient to extrapolate the final black hole mass from the first seconds of evolution. We also discuss potential multi-messenger signatures of the predicted fallback explosions. The enrichment of the ejecta in intermediate mass and iron-group elements varies considerably and is non-neligible for the more powerful explosions. Low-level neutrino emission after black hole formation from these very massive progenitors may be detectable in the case of a Galactic event.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust attenuations observed by stars and ionized gas are not necessarily the same. The lack of observational constraints on the nebular dust attenuation curve leaves a large uncertainty when correcting nebular dust attenuation with stellar continuum-based attenuation curves. Making use of the DAP catalogs of the MaNGA survey, we investigate the nebular dust attenuation of HII regions traced by the Balmer and Paschen lines. Based on a simple simulation, we find that star-forming regions on kpc scales favor the classic foreground screen dust model rather than the uniform mixture model. We propose a novel approach to fit the dust attenuation curve using the emission-line fluxes directly. For strong hydrogen recombination lines (e.g., H$\gamma$, H$\delta$, and H$\epsilon$), the slopes of the nebular attenuation curve can be well determined and are found to be in good agreement with the Fitzpatrick Milky Way extinction curve with an accuracy of $\lesssim 4\%$ in terms of the correction factor. However, severe contaminations/systematic uncertainties prevent us from obtaining reasonable values of the slopes for weak recombination lines (e.g., the high-order Balmer lines or the Paschen lines). We discuss how the choice of emission line measurement methods affects the results. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of deriving an average nebular dust attenuation curve given the current ground-based emission-line measurements.
#### Radiation Transport Simulations of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions from Star-Disk Collisions

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic collisions between a star on an inclined orbit around a supermassive black hole and its accretion disk offers a promising explanation for X-ray "quasi-periodic eruptions" (QPEs). Each passage through the disk shocks and compresses gas ahead of the star, which subsequently re-expands above the disk as a quasi-spherical cloud. We present spherically symmetric Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations which follow the production of photons behind the radiation-mediated shock, Comptonization by hot electrons, and the eventual escape of the radiation through the expanding debris. Such one-dimension calculations are approximately justified for thin disks, through which the star of radius $R_{\star}$ passes faster than the shocked gas can flow around the star. For collision speeds $v_{\rm coll} \gtrsim 0.15 c$ and disk surface densities $\Sigma \sim 10^{3}$ g cm$^{-2}$ characteristic of those encountered by stellar orbits consistent with QPE recurrence times, the predicted transient light curves exhibit peak luminosities $\gtrsim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and Comptonized quasi-thermal (Wien-like) spectra which peak at energies $h\nu \sim 100$ eV, broadly consistent with QPE properties. For these conditions, gas and radiation are out of equilibrium and the emission temperature is harder than the blackbody value due to inefficient photon production behind the shock. Alternatively, for higher disk densities and/or lower shock velocities, QPE emission could instead represent the comparatively brief phase shortly after shock break-out, though in this case the bulk of the radiation is thermalized and occurs in the ultraviolet instead of the X-ray band. In either scenario, reproducing the observed eruption properties (duration, luminosity, temperature) requires a large radius $R_{\star} \gtrsim 10R_{\odot}$, which may point to inflation of the star's atmosphere from repeated collisions.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper proposes a new method for estimating the total quantity of material in moving circumgalactic and intergalactic clouds from O VI measurements. We simulate high-velocity clouds (HVCs) with the FLASH hydrodynamic code and track the ionization and recombination of all ionization levels of oxygen as a function of time. We calculate the O VI/oxygen ratio ($f_{\rm O VI}$) in our dynamic NEI clouds, finding that it differs significantly from that in static gas. We find that O VI exists in cool, medium, and hot gas in the clouds. As such, it traces all of the hydrogen rather than merely the ionized hydrogen. The total quantity of hydrogen along a typical observed line of sight through a cloud can be estimated from the observed O VI column density, metallicity, and our $f_{\rm O VI}$. We provide the simulations' $f_{\rm O VI}$, a prescription for finding $f_{\rm O VI}$ for observed dynamic clouds, and a methodology for calculating the total hydrogen column density from this $f_{\rm O VI}$ and an observed O VI column density. As examples, we use our $f_{\rm O VI}$ to estimate the total hydrogen column densities along various observed sight lines through two HVCs, Complex C and the Magellanic Stream, finding that these clouds contain more material than the previous lower limits. We also extend this analysis to {low-redshift} intergalactic O VI clouds, finding that they contain several times more baryonic material than previously thought and therefore may account for a significant fraction of the Universe's baryons.
