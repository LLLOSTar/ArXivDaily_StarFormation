#### Structural Parameters of the Thin Disk Population from Evolved Stars in Solar Neighborhood

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the structural parameters of the thin-disk population by analyzing the spatial distribution of evolved stars in the solar neighbourhood. From the $\it Gaia$ Data Release 3 database, about 39.1 million stars within 1 kpc and with relative parallax errors $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.10$ were selected. The photometric data was corrected for extinction using a Galactic dust map. The sample was refined by considering the color-magnitude region $M_{\rm G}\times (G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP})_0$ associated with evolved stars, applying a stricter parallax error limit of $\sigma_{\varpi}/\varpi\leq 0.02$, and yielding 671,600 stars. The star sample was divided into 36 regions based on their Galactic coordinates, with evolved stars in the absolute magnitude range of $-1< M_{\rm G}~{\rm (mag)}\leq 4$ further split into five one-unit magnitude intervals. This led to 180 subgroups whose space density profiles were modelled using a single-component Galaxy model. The analysis shows that the space densities are in agreement with the literature and that the scale heights vary with $200<H~{\rm (pc)}<600$ interval to their absolute magnitudes. Red clump stars in the solar neighbourhood were also estimated to have a scale height of $295\pm10$ pc. These findings indicate that evolved stars with bright absolute magnitudes originate from the evolution of the early spectral-type stars with short scale height, while fainter ones come from the evolution of the intermediate spectral-type stars with large scale height, suggesting variations in scale height reflect the contribution of Galactic evolution processes.
#### Toward early-type eclipsing binaries as extragalactic milestones: IV. Physical properties of three detached O/B-type systems in the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 We present a complete set of physical parameters for three early-type eclipsing binary systems in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): OGLE LMC-ECL-17660, OGLE LMC-ECL-18794, and HV 2274, together with the orbital solutions. The first and third systems comprise B-type stars, while the second has O-type components and exhibits a total eclipse. We performed a complex analysis that included modeling light and radial velocity curves, O-C analysis, and additional non-LTE spectroscopic analysis for the O-type system. We found that OGLE LMC-ECL-17660 is at least a triple and, tentatively, a quadruple. A significant non-linear period decrease was determined for HV 2274. Its origin is unclear, possibly due to a faint, low-mass companion on a wide orbit. The analyzed components have masses ranging from 11.7 M$_\odot$ to 22.1 M$_\odot$, radii from 7.0 R$_\odot$ to 14.2 R$_\odot$, and temperatures between 22500 K and 36000 K. For HV 2274, the precision of our masses and radii is about six times higher than in previous studies. The position of the components of all six systems analyzed in this series on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams indicates they are evolutionarily advanced on the main sequence. Our sample contributes significantly to the knowledge of physical parameters of early-type stars in the mass range of 11 M$_\odot$ to 23 M$_\odot$. A new mass-luminosity relation for O and B-type stars in the LMC is provided. Additionally, we used the measured apsidal motion of the systems to compare the observational and theoretical internal structure constant.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep optical observations of the stellar halo of NGC 300, an LMC-mass galaxy, acquired with the DEEP sub-component of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE) using the 4 m Blanco Telescope. Our resolved star analysis reveals a large, low surface brightness stellar stream ($M_{V}\sim-8.5$; [Fe/H] $= -1.4\pm0.15$) extending more than 40 kpc north from the galaxy's center. We also find other halo structures, including potentially an additional stream wrap to the south, which may be associated with the main stream. The morphology and derived low metallicities of the streams and shells discovered surrounding NGC 300 are highly suggestive of a past accretion event. Assuming a single progenitor, the accreted system is approximately Fornax-like in luminosity, with an inferred mass ratio to NGC 300 of approximately $1:15$. We also present the discovery of a metal-poor globular cluster ($R_{\rm{proj}}=23.3$~kpc; $M_{V}=-8.99\pm0.16$; [Fe/H] $\approx-1.6\pm0.6$) in the halo of NGC 300, the furthest identified globular cluster associated with NGC 300. The stellar structures around NGC 300 represent the richest features observed in a Magellanic Cloud analog to date, strongly supporting the idea that accretion and subsequent disruption is an important mechanism in the assembly of dwarf galaxy stellar halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the star formation process has been studied for decades, many important aspects of the physics involved remain unsolved. Recent advancement of instrumentation in the infrared, far-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelength regimes have contributed to a significantly improved understanding of processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) leading to star formation. The future of research on the ISM and star formation looks exciting with instruments like the JWST, ALMA, etc., already contributing to the topic by gathering high-resolution high-sensitivity data and with several larger ground- and space-bound facilities either being planned or constructed. India has a sizable number of astronomers engaged in research on topics related to the ISM and star formation. In this white paper invited by the Astronomical Society of India to prepare a vision document for Indian astronomy, we review the Indian contributions to the global understanding of the star formation process and suggest areas that require focused efforts both in creating observing facilities and in theoretical front in India, in order to improve the impact of our research in the coming decades.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite widespread adoption of deep learning models to address a variety of computer vision tasks, planetary science has yet to see extensive utilization of such tools to address its unique problems. On Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, tracking seasonal trends and weather patterns of clouds provides crucial insights into one of the most complex climates in the Solar System, yet much of the available image data are still analyzed in a conventional way. In this work, we apply a Mask R-CNN trained via transfer learning to perform instance segmentation of clouds in Titan images acquired by the Cassini spacecraft - a previously unexplored approach to a big data problem in planetary science. We demonstrate that an automated technique can provide quantitative measures for clouds, such as areas and centroids, that may otherwise be prohibitively time-intensive to produce by human mapping. Furthermore, despite Titan specific challenges, our approach yields accuracy comparable to contemporary cloud identification studies on Earth and other worlds. We compare the efficiencies of human-driven versus algorithmic approaches, showing that transfer learning provides speed-ups that may open new horizons for data investigation for Titan. Moreover, we suggest that such approaches have broad potential for application to similar problems in planetary science where they are currently under-utilized. Future planned missions to the planets and remote sensing initiatives for the Earth promise to provide a deluge of image data in the coming years that will benefit strongly from leveraging machine learning approaches to perform the analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The Cygnus-X complex is a massive, nearby (1.4 kpc) star-forming region with several OB associations. As part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program, we carried out 3.6 millimeter (mm) continuum and spectral line high-resolution observations ($\sim$ 3 - 4$''$) toward DR18, covering several molecular species with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30m telescope. In addition, multi-wavelength archival datasets were used to provide a comprehensive analysis of the region. A comparison of the 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission confirms that a B2 star (DR18-05) shapes the cometary HII region in the DR18 cavity, with ionized gas escaping toward the OB2 association. On the other hand, the extended 3.6mm and 6 cm continuum emission are likely to trace photoevaporating ionized gas from ultraviolet radiation from the Cyg OB2 association, not from DR18-05. The shell structure around DR18-05 indicates photodissociation regions (PDRs) formed by the expanding HII region and photo-erosion from DR18-05 and OB2 stars. We also identified 18 compact cores with N$_2$H$^+$ emission, half of which are gravitationally bound and mostly located in colder regions behind the PDRs. The SiO emission is found only in PDRs, with narrow-line widths ( 0.8 - 2.0 km s$^{-1}$) and lower abundances (X(SiO) $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{-11}$ - 1$\times$10$^{-10}$). Comparing with the UV irradiated shock models, we suggest that the SiO emission partially encompassing the HII region arises from the molecular gas region, marginally compressed by low-velocity shocks with $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$, irradiated by external UV radiation (G$_{\rm 0} \sim 10^{2} - 10^{3}$), as they traverse through a medium with $n_{\rm H} \sim 10^{4}$ to 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.
#### The distribution of misalignment angles in multipolar planetary nebulae

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to <60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles (alpha) and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles (delta) between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20<delta<60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.
#### A study of the frequency and characteristics of stellar companions and Jupiter-like planets in nearby open clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of companions of solar-type stars in nearby young moving groups (NYMGs) show that they split into two groups: stellar and brown dwarf companions (mass ratio $q>0.05$) and Jupiter-like (JL) planets ($q<0.02$). The frequency of JL planets in NYMGs appears to be higher than that obtained from radial velocity (RV) surveys. We extended the search for companions to three nearby clusters of intermediate age: Hyades, Coma Berenices, and Ursa Major. They are older and formed in more massive events than the NYMGs. The sample of host stars is complete for the core of the clusters, while we considered only a fraction of the tidal tails. We used the same methods considered for the members of NYMGs. We obtained a fairly complete sample of stellar companions and detected six massive JL planets. We found a lower frequency of equal-mass companions than in the NYMGs; this might be related to how binaries form in these environments. We also observed a concentration of stellar binaries in the cores of Ursa Major and Coma Berenices; we attribute this to the selective loss of low-mass systems. The observed scarcity of wide companions in Hyades can be due to the destruction of binaries in close encounters. The frequency of JL planets is lower than in the NYMGs but similar to that obtained from RV surveys. This extends the correlation with age and mass previously found for NYMGs. Results of this study alone do not indicate whether age or mass are the factors driving the observed correlation. A comparison of the frequencies of free-floating planets from microlenses and in young associations favours mass as the main driving parameter. Once the initial cluster mass function is considered, the frequency of JL planets in NYMGs is consistent with the results obtained using RVs.
