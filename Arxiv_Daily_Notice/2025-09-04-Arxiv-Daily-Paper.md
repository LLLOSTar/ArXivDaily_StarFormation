 - **Abstract**
 This white paper explores the potential for strategic synergies between the JWST and the Ariel telescopes, two flagship observatories poised to revolutionise the study of exoplanet atmospheres. Both telescopes have the potential to address common fundamental questions about exoplanets-especially concerning their nature and origins-and serve a growing scientific community. With their operations now anticipated to overlap, starting from 2030, there is a unique opportunity to enhance the scientific outputs of both observatories through coordinated efforts. In this report, authored by the Ariel-JWST Synergy Working Group, part of the Ariel Consortium Science Team, we summarise the capabilities of JWST and Ariel; we highlight their key differences, similarities, synergies, and distinctive strengths. Ariel is designed to conduct a broad survey of exoplanet atmospheres but remains highly flexible, allowing the mission to integrate insights from JWST's discoveries. Findings from JWST, including data from initiatives shaped by NASA's decadal survey priorities and community-driven research themes, will inform the development of Ariel's core survey strategy. Conversely, Ariel's ability to perform broad-wavelength coverage observations for bright targets provides complementary avenues for exoplanet researchers, particularly those interested in time-domain observations and large-scale atmospheric studies. This paper identifies key pathways for fostering JWST-Ariel synergies, many of which can be initiated even before Ariel's launch. Leveraging their complementary designs and scopes, JWST and Ariel can jointly address fundamental questions about the nature, formation, and evolution of exoplanets. Such strategic collaboration has the potential to maximise the scientific returns of both observatories and lay the foundation for future facilities in the roadmap to exoplanet exploration.

 - **Abstract**
 We present and analyze follow-up, higher resolution ($R$ $\sim$ 70) $H$ and $K$ band integral field spectroscopy of the superjovian exoplanet HIP 99770 b with SCExAO/CHARIS. Our new data recover the companion at a high signal-to-noise ratio in both bandpasses and more than double the astrometric baseline for its orbital motion. Jointly modeling HIP 99770 b's position and the star's astrometry from \textit{Hipparcos} and \textit{Gaia} yields orbital parameters consistent with those from the discovery paper, albeit with smaller errors, and a slight preference for a smaller semimajor axis ($\sim$15.7--15.8 au)and a larger eccentricity ($\sim$0.28--0.29), disfavoring a circular orbit. We revise its dynamical mass slightly downwards to 15.0$_{-4.4}^{+4.5}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a flat prior and 13.1$_{-5.2}^{+4.8}$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for a more standard log-uniform mass prior, where the inclusion of its relative radial-velocity measurement is primarily responsible for these changes. \textcolor{red}{We find consistent results for HIP 99770 b's dynamical mass including recent VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry, albeit with a slightly smaller, better constrained eccentricity of $e$ $\sim$ 0.22$^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$}. HIP 99770 b is a $\sim$ 1300 K object at the L/T transition with a gravity intermediate between that of the HR 8799 planets and older, more massive field brown dwarfs with similar temperatures but with hints of equilibrium chemistry. HIP 99770 b is particularly well suited for spectroscopic follow up with Roman CGI during the technology demonstration phase at 730 nm to further constrain its metallicity and chemistry; JWST thermal infrared observations could likewise explore the planet's carbon chemistry, metallicity, and clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Globular clusters (GCs) host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures imply early retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the accumulation, fate, and eventual removal of gas released by evolved stars in young GCs, and their implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that low-velocity (< 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are gravitationally retained in >10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions, mapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed second population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle accretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs and neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will clear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from an explosive dispersal outflow in the Milky Way, revealing a new source class of high-energy emission. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.2 $-$ 500 GeV range, we detect a significant ($ > 35\sigma $) $\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with the DR21 outflow, located at a distance of 1.5 kpc in the Cygnus-X star-forming region. The spectrum follows a power-law plus an exponential cutoff model with a spectral index $\Gamma = 2.08\pm0.02$ and $E_{\rm c} = 10089 \pm 2963$~MeV, integrating which we estimate a total $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma} \simeq (2.17\pm 0.15) \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.1-500$ GeV band. This $\gamma$-ray emission is spatially coincident with additional multiwavelength data, including allWISE mid-IR and regions of dense gas. By comparing the observed $\gamma$-ray luminosity to the estimated kinetic energy of the outflow inferred from prior studies of DR21, we find that $\leq 15\%$ of the kinetic power of the outflow goes into particle acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that explosive dispersal outflows can contribute significantly to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background of the Galaxy, highlighting their importance as particle accelerators in star-forming environments.
#### The Interstellar Medium in I Zw 18 seen with JWST/MIRI: II. Warm Molecular Hydrogen and Warm Dust

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/MIRI spectra from the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer of IZw18, a nearby dwarf galaxy with a metallicity of $\sim 3$% Solar. Here, we investigate warm molecular hydrogen, H2, observed in spectra extracted in $\sim 120$ pc apertures centered on eleven regions of interest. We detect 7 H2 rotational lines, some of which are among the weakest ever measured. The H2 population diagrams are fit with local-thermodynamic-equilibrium models and models of photodissociation regions. We also fit the ortho-/para-H2 ratios (OPRs); in three of the six regions for which it was possible to fit the OPR, we find values significantly greater than 3, the maximum value for local thermodynamic equilibrium. To our knowledge, although predicted theoretically, this is the first time that OPR significantly $> 3$ has been measured in interstellar gas. We find that OPR tends to increase with decreasing H2 column density, consistent with the expected effects of self-shielding in advancing photodissociation fronts. The population diagrams are consistent with H nucleon densities of $\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and an interstellar radiation field scaling factor, G0, of $\sim 10^3$. This warm, dense H2 gas co-exists with the same highly ionized gas that emits [OIV] and [NeV]. Emission from T $\geq 50$K dust is detected, including an as-yet unidentified dust emission feature near 14 $\mu$m; possible identification as Al$_2$O$_3$ is discussed. The continuum emission from several regions requires that a considerable fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust. Despite stacking spectra in the SE where H2 is found, no significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is detected.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's (MW's) star formation history (SFH) offers insight into the chronology of its assembly and the mechanisms driving its structural development. In this study, we present an inference and analysis of the spatially resolved SFH and the MW disc growth. Our approach leverages both stellar birth radii estimates and the complete reconstruction of the MW stellar disc using a novel orbit superposition method from APOGEE data, allowing us to trace the orbit-mass weighted SFH based on formation sites while taking into account stellar mass loss. We find that the MW is a typical disc galaxy exhibiting inside-out formation: it was compact at $z > 2$ ($\rm R_{\rm eff} \approx 2$ kpc), had a peak in its star formation rate (SFR) 9--10 Gyr ago, and grew to a present-day size of $\rm R_{\rm eff} \approx 4.3$ kpc. A secondary peak in SFR $\sim 4$ Gyr ago is responsible for the onset of the outer disc, which comprises the metal-poor, low-$\alpha$ population. We find that in-situ star formation in the solar neighbourhood started 8--9 Gyr ago. The MW disc is characterised by a negative mean age gradient, as the result of the inside-out growth, with additional flattening induced by stellar radial migration. Our work showcases the importance of accounting for radial migration and stellar sample selection function when inferring the SFH and build-up of the MW disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of stellar rotation along the main sequences of NGC 1866 and NGC 1856, two young (~200-300 Myr) massive clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using MUSE integral field spectroscopy. Differences in stellar rotation have been proposed as an explanation for the extended main sequence turn-offs and split main sequences in these clusters. In agreement with this idea, we find strong links between the photometric colours of the cluster stars and their projected rotation velocities, Vsini. While stars blueward of the split main sequences are characterized by a range of relatively low spins, those with redder colours are fast rotators. Following a statistical correction for inclination, we measure mean equatorial velocities for the red main-sequence stars in both clusters of V_eq=300 km/s, corresponding to 70-80% of the critical values predicted for such stars by current stellar models. We discuss these findings in the context of the different scenarios proposed to explain the stellar rotation distributions of young massive clusters. We further investigate whether the high rotation rates provide a natural explanation for the high fractions of Be stars we observe in both clusters, peaking at >~50% at the turn-off. We argue that if ~85% of the critical rotation rate is high enough to trigger the formation of a decretion disk, most upper main sequence stars in the clusters are expected to become Be stars before leaving the main sequence.
#### Reconciling Jupiter's Vertical Motions with the Observed Cloud Structure in the Upper Troposphere

 - **Abstract**
 The eddy fluxes of angular momentum in Jupiter's upper troposphere are known to converge in prograde jets and diverge in retrograde jets. Away from the equator, this implies convergence of the Eulerian mean meridional flow in zones (anticyclonic shear) and divergence in belts (cyclonic shear). It indicates lower-tropospheric downwelling in zones and upwelling in belts because the mean meridional circulation almost certainly closes at depth. Yet the observed banded structure of Jupiter's clouds and hazes suggests that there is upwelling in the brighter zones and downwelling in the darker belts. Here, we show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by considering not the Eulerian but the transformed Eulerian mean circulation, which includes a Stokes drift owing to eddies and is a better approximation of the Lagrangian mean transport of tracers such as ammonia. The potential vorticity structure inferred from observations paired with mixing length arguments suggests that there is transformed Eulerian mean upwelling in zones and downwelling in belts. Simulations with a global circulation model of Jupiter's upper atmosphere demonstrate the plausibility of these inferences and allow us to speculate on the band structure at deeper levels.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed multi-wavelength afterglow study of the short GRB 250704B, extensively monitored in optical and near-infrared bands. Its afterglow displays an unusually long-duration plateau followed by an achromatic break and a steep decline, deviating from canonical GRB afterglows. While long plateaus are often explained by central engine activity, we find that for GRB 250704B, an energy injection model requires unreasonable parameters. The afterglow is better explained by an off-axis power-law structured jet with a narrow core ($\theta_c \approx 0.7^{\circ}$) viewed at a modest angle ($\theta_v \approx 1.9^{\circ}$). A comparison with GRB 170817A shows that both events are consistent with the off-axis structured jet scenario, where the shape of the light curve is governed primarily by the geometry of the jet and the viewing angle rather than the energetics, microphysical parameters, or external density. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating the jet structure in GRB modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present long-baseline observations of the Fomalhaut outer debris disk at 223 GHz (1.3 mm) from ALMA Cycle 5, which we use along with archival short-baseline observations to produce a 0".57 resolution mosaic of the disk at a sensitivity of 7 $\mu$Jy/bm. We use radial profiles to measure the disk at the ansae and find that the southeast (SE) side of the disk is 4 AU wider than the northwest (NW) side as observed by ALMA. We also find that the peak brightness of the NW ansa is $21\pm1\%$ brighter than the SE ansa. We perform MCMC fits of the ALMA visibilities using two analytical, eccentric disk models. Our results suggest that the model including a dispersion parameter for the proper eccentricity ($\sigma_{e_p}$), which accounts for additional scatter in the eccentricity of individual orbits, is preferred over the model without one. Such a model implies that self-gravitation, particle collisions, and close-packing could play a role in shaping the overall structure of the Fomalhaut disk as is seen in eccentric planetary rings. Crucially, neither model can reproduce the brightness or width asymmetry near the NW ansa. No emission from the Intermediate Belt is detected, allowing us to place a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 396 $\mu$Jy at 1.3 mm. We also discover a spectral line in archival Cycle 3 data centered at $\nu_{\rm obs}\approx230.25$ GHz at the location of the ``Great Dust Cloud," whose redshift from the expected CO line for Fomalhaut confirms the source is a background galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice clouds are important for polar energy balance and the carbon dioxide cycle on Mars. However, uncertainties remain regarding their physical and radiative properties, which control how polar $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ clouds interact with the global Martian climate. Here, we use Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) observations of atmospheric radiance to estimate these physical and radiative properties. We find that Martian $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ clouds are typically composed of large particles from a narrow size distribution with an effective radius of 46 $\mu$m and an effective variance of $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ in the southern hemisphere, and an effective radius of 42 $\mu$m and an effective variance of $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ in the north. The similarity in sizes of $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice particles in both hemispheres may be due to the fact that $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ clouds tend to form near the same pressure level in each hemisphere, despite the higher surface pressures in the north. We use a simplified convective cooling model to show that the small effective variance we derive may be a consequence of the fact that $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ is also the dominant atmospheric constituent on Mars, which allows $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice particles to reach sizes upwards of 10 $\mu$m within seconds. At the same time, the fact that the Martian atmosphere is so thin means that large particles fall rapidly to the surface, reducing the range of particle sizes that can remain in the atmosphere for any extended period of time. This study is part of ongoing work to add $\text{CO}_{\text{2}}$ ice opacity profiles to the MCS retrieval pipeline.

 - **Abstract**
 Observing and characterizing pre- and protostellar cores in the earliest and densest stages of star formation is challenging due to their short timescales and high densities, limiting the suitable tracers and targets. We conducted ALMA-Atacama Compact Array (ACA) stand-alone observations of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ (1$_{\rm 1,0}$-1$_{\rm 1,1}$) emission, which is believed to trace cold high-density regions, toward three dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud: (1) L1544, likely in the densest prestellar phase; (2) MC 35-mm, a candidate for the first hydrostatic core; and (3) MC 27/L1521F, which hosts a Class 0 very-low luminosity object. These observations provide high angular resolution data for the line across a set of cores selected to represent consecutive stages around the onset of star formation, offering a unique opportunity to trace the time evolution of $\sim$10$^4$ years. With the single-dish total-power array, we detected ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ emission in all three cores, revealing its presence over scales of $\sim$10,000 au. In the interferometric 7 m array data with a beam size of 3.$''$5 ($\sim$500\,au), emission was detected only toward the central continuum source of MC 35-mm, with a significance of $\sim$3$\sigma$. No significant detections were found in the other targets, placing an upper limit on the H$_2$D$^{+}$ abundance of $\sim$10$^{-11}$ in the dense components traced by the interferometric continuum emission. These results suggest that ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ predominantly exhibits an extended distribution over several thousand au in the early stages of star formation. Detection in compact, dense central structures may only be achieved within a few $\times$ 10$^{4}$ years immediately before or after protostar formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The Polarimetry in the Ultraviolet to Find Features in INterStellar dust (PUFFINS) is a SmallSat mission concept designed to obtain ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetric observations to probe the interstellar dust grain properties and to understand wavelength-dependent extinction and star formation. PUFFINS plans to observe 70 UV bright target stars at varying distances within a 180-320 nm wavelength range with 0.02% polarimetric accuracy. PUFFINS uses a simple telescope design with all reflective optics coated with protected aluminum to enhance reflectivity in the UV. The telescope and the spectropolarimeter, which consists of a Wollaston prism and a half-wave retarder, have been carefully selected to be greater than Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6). The telescope is designed to exhibit negligible instrumental polarization and crosstalk, significantly reducing the time needed for polarimetric calibration in orbit. The optimum and careful selection of the target stars will enable PUFFINS to observe an expanded and well-defined sample to test the predictions by interstellar grain alignment theory in the observation phase of 9 months. This paper outlines the details of the optical and optomechanical design and evaluates the polarimetric performance of PUFFINS.

 - **Abstract**
 To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated intelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation scheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates coordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising dozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and time-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation modes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for sidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up capabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude bands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and comprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky grids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At the core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates multiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital catalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging requirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback mechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved targets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or lost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights combine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar interference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time priority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates operator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable weight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new catalogue of 578 OB cluster (OBC) candidates in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), identified using a MeanShift-based algorithm on HST's F275W-band imaging from the PHAT (Dalcanton et al. 2012) and PHAST (Chen et al. 2025) Hubble surveys. These clusters exhibit typical half-light radii of 1-2 pc and strong ultraviolet luminosities indicative of recent massive star formation. Spatial analysis reveals a pronounced north-south asymmetry: clusters in the northern disc show tight associations with giant molecular clouds (GMCs), while southern clusters appear more compact and luminous but less correlated with molecular gas. Two-point correlation functions demonstrate significant clustering of OBC candidates on scales 100 pc and a strong spatial association with GMCs, consistent with hierarchical star formation in dense gas-rich environments. These findings offer new constraints on the early evolution and feedback-driven dispersal of young stellar clusters across galactic discs.

 - **Abstract**
 A combined effect of the density-stratified turbulence and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers causes the alpha effect and the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. This results in generation of the large-scale magnetic field in colliding protogalactic clouds, merging protostellar clouds and protoplanetary discs. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions caused by the inhomogeneity of turbulence to the $\alpha$ tensor and effective pumping velocity. The isotropic part of the alpha tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field caused by product of the fluid density stratification and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity due to collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. However, the alpha tensor is independent of the effects of collapsing or expanding of clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethylene oxide (c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O) and its isomer, acetaldehyde (CH$_{3}$CHO), are important complex organic molecules owing to their potential role in the formation of amino acids (R-CH(NH$_{2}$)-COOH) in ISM. The detection of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O in hot molecular cores suggests that the possible existence of larger ring-shaped molecules containing more than three carbon atoms, such as furan (c-C$_{4}$H$_{4}$O), which shares structural similarities with ribose (C$_{5}$H$_{10}$O5), the sugar component of DNA. In this study, we report the first detection of the rotational emission lines of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, based on observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 7. The fractional abundances of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO relative to H$_{2}$ are $(2.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-9}$ and $(7.1\pm0.9)\times10^{-9}$, respectively. The column density ratio between CH$_{3}$CHO and c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O is $3.4\pm0.7$. A Pearson correlation heat map reveals strong positive correlations ($r$ $>$ 0.5) between the abundances and excitation temperatures of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO, suggesting a possible chemical connection between those two molecules. To investigate this further, we conducted a two-phase warm-up chemical model using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. A comparison between our derived abundances and the predictions from our chemical model and existence model demonstrates good agreement within factors of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. We propose that c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O may form in G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 via the grain surface reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{4}$ and O, but CH$_{3}$CHO may be produced through the surface reaction between CH$_{3}$ and HCO.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a reanalysis of the metallicity of the double red clump (RC) stars from the Milky Way bulge. Two leading explanations for the existence of the double RC concern possible differences in chemical composition (multiple populations of stars) or distance (X-shaped bulge). We aim to verify the chemical composition hypothesis by determining the mean metallicity of each RC. We use infrared photometric data and metallicities from a previous study (that are based on the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectra). In contrast with previous studies, we assign stars to RCs or the red giant branch using a Bayesian approach. Our resulting difference between mean metallicity of the two RCs equals: $0.23^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ or $0.28^{+0.17}_{-0.18}~\mathrm{dex}$, if the red giant branch bump is included or not, respectively. Because of the high statistical error, the result does not confirm the multiple populations hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: While the LMC's influence on MW stellar streams has been extensively studied, streams associated with the Clouds have received far less attention. Beyond the Magellanic Stream, only four stream candidates (S1-S4) have been reported. Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\sim30^\circ$) and narrow ($\sim1.2^\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our goals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3 candidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members; and 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW or the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network classifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through a cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve stream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby accounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify 1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's apparent width has grown from $\sim1.2^\circ$ to $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ compared to previous studies. We also present a list of 440 potential S3 red clump stars, which are valuable targets for spectroscopic follow-up thanks to their well-defined luminosities and ability to yield precise distances. Both modelling and a comparison of S3 stars' closest approach distance and velocity with the LMC's escape velocity indicate that S3 is unlikely to originate from the LMC, instead representing a distant ($\sim75$ kpc) MW stream. Conclusions: S3 is the most distant ($\sim75$ kpc) extended ($\sim30^\circ$ long, $\sim3$-$4^\circ$ thick) MW stream known, offering a unique probe of the outer halo and the LMC's recent influence. Its angular width corresponds to a physical thickness of $\sim4$-5 kpc, making S3 among the thickest streams discovered.
