#### Dusty Clump Survival in Supernova Ejecta: Dust-Mediated Growth vs. Crushing by the Reverse Shock

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the interaction of dense, cold ejecta clumps with a fast reverse shock, an instance of the "cloud-crushing" problem, is essential to assess whether core-collapse supernovae act as net dust factories or net dust destroyers. This work assesses whether dusty ejecta clumps are destroyed by the reverse shock or instead cool, condense, and grow in mass under realistic supernova-remnant conditions. Cloud-crushing timescales are computed and compared to radiative cooling timescales, including both gas-phase cooling and dust-induced cooling, for a large grid of clump densities, dust-to-gas mass ratios, and shock velocities. When the dust-to-gas mass ratio exceeds $10^{-3}$, gas-grain collisions become efficient enough that the cooling timescale $t_{\rm cool}$ falls below the cloud-crushing timescale $t_{\rm cc}$ over a broad span of clump densities and shock velocities, enabling dusty clumps to survive even fast reverse shocks. For example, at clump densities $\geq 2 \times 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, dust-to-gas mass ratios $\sim 10^{-2}$, and shock velocities up to $2000$ km s$^{-1}$, enhanced gas-grain cooling drives the system into a regime where dusty clumps can gain additional cold mass and increase their dust masses. Strong radiative cooling can shield dust-rich clumps in supernova remnants, enabling a significant fraction of ejecta dust to be injected into the interstellar medium. These results mirror the "growth" regime found in studies of circumgalactic clouds and rapidly cooling shocked stellar winds, implying a larger dust survival in supernova remnants. Indeed, the dusty globules seen in the Crab Nebula occupy the predicted survival regime across a wide range of physical parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently discovered massive $\alpha$-enriched (MAE) stars have surface chemistry consistent with members of the older thick disk Milky Way population but high masses ($\sim$ 1.5 - 3 M$_{\odot}$) that suggest these stars are young. The origin of MAE stars is not fully understood although binary interactions are likely an important formation pathway. To better constrain the history of MAE stars, we have measured metallicities, carbon isotope ratios, and CNO abundances in 49 red clump stars and four red giants. Our sample included thin disk, thick disk, and MAE stars to best constrain different formation scenarios. We observed our sample stars using the Tull spectrograph on the McDonald 2.7m telescope and derived abundances using synthetic spectra created by the Turbospectrum radiative transfer code. Overall, we find that 10 of our red clump MAE stars are consistent with the average thick disk carbon isotope ratio of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 8.2 $\pm$ 3.4. We find five MAE stars that have significantly higher carbon isotope ratios ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C $>$ 15) than stars at similar metallicities. Two of the anomalous stars show abundance patterns consistent with AGB mass transfer while three MAE stars have $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios similar to massive, single RC stars and show no clear signs of binarity from radial velocity monitoring or from the Gaia RUWE measurement. Overall, we find that carbon isotope ratio measurements provide a unique constraint when discerning the possible origins of MAE stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Precessing relativistic jets launched by compact objects are rarely directly measured, and present an invaluable opportunity to better understand many features of astrophysical jets. In this Letter we present MeerKAT radio observations of the neutron star X-ray binary system (NSXB) Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1). We observe a curved S-shaped morphology on $\sim 20''$ $(\sim1\:\text{pc})$ scales in the radio emission around Cir X-1. We identify flux density and position changes in the S-shaped emission on year timescales, robustly showing its association with relativistic jets. The jets of Cir X-1 are still propagating with mildly relativistic velocities $\sim1\:\text{pc}$ from the core, the first time such large scale jets have been seen from a NSXB. The position angle of the jet axis is observed to vary on year timescales, over an extreme range of at least $110°$. The morphology and position angle changes of the jet are best explained by a smoothly changing launch direction, verifying suggestions from previous literature, and indicating that precession of the jets is occurring. Steady precession of the jet is one interpretation of the data, and if occurring, we constrain the precession period and half-opening angle to $>10$ years and $>33°$ respectively, indicating precession in a different parameter space to similar known objects such as SS~433.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess archival high-energy data for key stars on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Target Stars and Systems 2025 list, as stellar radiation is critical to shaping and interpreting planetary atmospheres. Using a sample of 98 nearby stars (HWO Tier 1 targets), we compile and evaluate X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data from archival eROSITA, Chandra, XMM-Newton, ROSAT, EUVE, Swift, FUSE, IUE, GALEX, and HST. We examine spectral and temporal coverage, assess data quality, and identify major gaps. UV data are moderately available, with most coverage coming from near-UV spectra from IUE. Far fewer stars have far-UV spectra, especially from HST. In the X-ray regime, some stars have high-quality spectra, while others are limited to shallow detections or broad-band photometry. A small fraction of the sample has both X-ray and UV spectra of sufficient quality to support full spectral energy distribution modeling. Truly comprehensive coverage across X-ray, extreme-UV, and both UV bands remains extremely rare. Most datasets are single-epoch, limiting assessments of variability and flares - key factors in atmospheric photochemistry and escape. Moreover, the lack of simultaneous or contemporaneous observations across bands adds further uncertainty. Our findings underscore the need for new space-based missions and coordinated multiwavelength campaigns, ideally with overlapping coverage, to improve stellar characterization for HWO. As several key observatories age and face potential decommissioning, there is a narrow window of opportunity to secure these critical data. Investing in this effort now will directly support the science goals of HWO and enhance future studies of planetary habitability.
#### Lyman-Alpha Emission from K and M Dwarfs: Intrinsic Profiles, Variability, and Flux in the Habitable Zone

 - **Abstract**
 Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) is the most prominent ultraviolet emission line in low-mass stars, playing a crucial role in exoplanet atmospheric photochemistry, heating, and escape. However, interstellar medium (ISM) absorption typically obscures most of the Ly$\alpha$ profile, requiring reconstructions that introduce systematic uncertainties. We present intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ profiles for 12 high radial velocity K and M dwarfs, where Doppler shifting minimizes ISM contamination, allowing direct measurements of $\sim$50-95\% of the line flux. Our sample spans the K-to-M spectral transition, enabling us to constrain the dependence of self-reversals in Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles on effective temperature ($T_{eff}$). The depth of self-reversal, driven by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) effects, decreases with decreasing $T_{eff}$, with M dwarfs exhibiting little to none. Two stars, Ross 1044 and Ross 451, were observed over multiple days, revealing $\sim$20\% Ly$\alpha$ variability confined to the line core - implying that studies relying on reconstructions may underestimate temporal variability. We find strong correlations between Ly$\alpha$ flux, peak-to-trough ratio, and hydrogen departure coefficients with $T_{eff}$, providing empirical constraints for stellar atmosphere models. A comparison of Ly$\alpha$ flux in the habitable zone shows measured values for high radial velocity stars less than the reconstructed values for the rest of the sample, likely due to the older ages of the high-RV stars and/or overestimated reconstructed fluxes due to model deficiency (e.g., neglecting self-reversal). Our results establish an empirical foundation for Ly$\alpha$ emission in K and M dwarfs, reducing uncertainties in reconstructions and improving models of stellar UV emission relevant to exoplanetary studies.
#### Modeling Long-Wavelength Amorphous Dust Emission Based on the Physically Motivated Soft-Potential Model
 - **Authors:** Masashi Nashimoto

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09203

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09203

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new amorphous dust emission model based on the soft-potential (SP) model, applicable in the long-wavelength range from the far-infrared to the microwave. The SP model is widely accepted in material physics to explain amorphous thermal properties and is an extension of the two-level systems (TLS) model, which has been applied in interstellar amorphous dust physics. In the SP model, by assuming that some atoms composing amorphous dust are trapped in a double-well potential (DWP) described by a quartic function, the electric interaction can be solved directly, allowing the absorption cross-section of the amorphous dust to be calculated. We present numerical and analytical solutions for the absorption cross-section of amorphous dust and compare these results, finding good agreement for the DWP with a sufficiently high potential barrier. Our findings show that the SP model can reproduce the observed spectrum of the Perseus molecular cloud with slightly better accuracy than the conventional TLS model. Additionally, the SP model can more effectively explain various long-wavelength dust emission features, such as the spectrum flattening in the submillimeter range and anomalous microwave emission (AME), compared to the TLS model. Further comparison and verification with observational data and laboratory measurements are necessary to refine the model.
#### High-resolution simulations of disc tearing in the GW Orionis triple system

 - **Abstract**
 The disc around the pre-main-sequence triple star system GW Orionis is known from observations to be warped and broken. Theoretical modelling has produced conflicting results regarding the mechanism responsible for breaking the disc. Analytical predictions for the measured parameters of GW Ori suggest the disc is only marginally stable to tearing. We present new high-resolution simulations of GW Ori that replicate the wavelike regime expected in thick, low-turbulence protoplanetary discs for the first time to settle this question. Using the most optimistic values of misalignment and stellar mass ratio allowed by observational constraints, we find that the GW Ori disc can be torn by stellar torques alone, without need for an embedded planet. Even if the disc retains a smooth warp in simulations with similar parameters, it is likely that any small perturbation in the density or temperature structure could cause the disc to break. The new simulations rule out retrograde disc rotation relative to the stellar orbits and tentatively suggest the thicker ($h/r = 0.04$) disc better matches observations. Going forward, we should take care to ensure models of GW Ori and similar systems appropriately represent the propagation of warps. Additionally, analytical predictions are derived from idealized (and often massless) discs and it is useful to assess how each observed disc might deviate from those assumptions, especially in the context of a young and active star-forming neighbourhood.
#### Impact of rotation on the accretion of entropy perturbations in collapsing massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Convection in the innermost shells of massive stars plays an important role in initiating core-collapse supernovae. When these convective motions reach the supernova shock, they create extra turbulence, which helps energize the explosion. In our earlier work, we studied the effect of rotation on the hydrodynamic evolution of convective vortices in collapsing stars. This study focuses on how rotation influences the entropy perturbations, which naturally form in turbulent convection. As these perturbations are carried inward with the collapsing star, they generate both vorticity and sound waves. Using linear perturbation theory, we model entropy waves as small disturbances on top of a steady background flow. Our results show that stellar rotation has little effect on the evolution of entropy perturbations during collapse, prior to encountering the supernova shock. This outcome is consistent with our earlier findings on the limited influence of rotation in the accretion of convective eddies.
#### The simple way to measure evolving dark energy without prior-volume effects

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simple yet effective method to resolve prior-volume effects, also known as projection effects, in full-shape analyses of the power spectrum multipoles within the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). By re-defining the EFTofLSS nuisance parameters to incorporate the contribution from the parameters impacting the amplitude of the EFTofLSS modelling components, we substantially mitigate projection effects. With the re-parametrisation the actual posterior maximum values are within the marginalised credible interval, eliminating significant shifts observed in the baseline analysis. We demonstrate the robustness of this method in full-shape $w_0w_a$CDM analyses on synthetic data in BOSS DR12 and DESI DR1 setups. For the evolving dark energy model, we then analyse the BOSS DR12 measurements, in combination with BAO information (from BOSS DR12, 6DF, SDSS DR7 MGS and eBOSS DR16 surveys) and 3$\times$2pt measurements from DES Y3 -- all data combinations are converging into the $w_0-w_a$ parameter region preferred by DESI+CMB+SNIa. From total combination of these large-scale structure probes without additional CMB information we find $w_0=-0.72 \pm 0.21, \, w_a=-0.91^{+0.78}_{-0.64}$. Despite the low significance of deviation from standard cosmology, this result underscores the potential of our re-parametrisation approach in delivering low-redshift cosmological constraints. We argue for the use of this approach in spectroscopic Stage IV surveys, where the potential deviation from standard cosmology can be detected with higher significance.
#### Detection of a Deeply Embedded Protocluster Candidate in NGC 602 with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry of NGC 602, a low-metallicity young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud, reveals an extended mid-infrared bright emission feature designated as MZS-1. This feature is prominent between 10 and 25.5 microns, but is extremely faint at 7.7 microns and entirely undetected at shorter wavelengths. MZS-1 exhibits an elliptical morphology with a major axis of approximately 8 arcseconds and a minor axis of about 4 arcseconds. Its elongated shape and multiple emission peaks in the two-dimensional flux map suggest a group of deeply embedded sources with blackbody-like temperatures ranging from 100 K to 140 K. SED fitting using the Robitaille 2017 model grids identifies these sources as Stage I young stellar objects (YSOs) with masses below approximately 3 solar masses and a total stellar mass of the protocluster of about 300 solar masses (based on a Salpeter IMF). The low YSO masses are consistent with their absence in Spitzer-based catalogs due to sensitivity limits. By revealing a deeply embedded, low-mass protocluster invisible in previous surveys, this work highlights JWST's unparalleled resolution and sensitivity in uncovering the earliest stages of low-mass cluster formation in the metal-poor regime.
