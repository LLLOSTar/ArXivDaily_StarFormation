 - **Abstract**
 The chemical abundance patterns of near-pristine objects provide important constraints on the properties of the first generations of stars in the Universe. We present the chemical abundances of five very metal-poor ([M/H]<-2.5) sub damped Lyman alpha systems (subDLAs) covering the redshift range $3.6<z<4.3$, identified with the XQ-100 survey. We find that the subDLAs in our sample show consistent chemical abundance patterns (in particular [C/O], [Al/O], and [Fe/O]) with those of very metal-poor DLAs. Based on Voigt profile fitting, the chemical abundance ratios [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] of individual velocity components in at least three of the subDLAs shows some intrinsic scatter. In order to verify these chemical inhomogeneities in absorption components, we present a novel method for computing ionization corrections (ICs) on a component-by-component basis and show that ICs alone cannot explain the variations in [C/O], [Al/O], and [Si/O] between components of the same absorber at ~2 sigma significance. Comparing the observed abundance ratios to the simulated core-collapse supernovae yields of early stellar populations, we find that all individual components of the subDLAs appears to be enriched by progenitor masses of <30 M_sol. The observed inhomogeneities between components can be reproduced by differences in the progenitor mass or supernova explosion energy. As such, the observed chemical inhomogeneities between components can be explained by poorly mixed gas from different nucleosynthetic events.
#### Efficient neutral-IGM inference from noisy 21-cm forest spectra with latent-space U-Net encoding and XGBoost

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm forest, comprising narrow absorption features imprinted on the radio spectra of high-redshift radio-loud quasars by intervening neutral hydrogen, offers a uniquely sensitive probe of the thermal state of the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization. Although over 30 such quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in practice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption features, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent studies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a statistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines for recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$, incorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We show that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially outperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective method dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net to extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter regression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM neutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT sightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time relative to existing techniques. We publicly release our code, training data, and models. Beyond the 21-cm forest, these results underscore the promise of hybrid deep learning and gradient-boosted inference techniques for extracting physical information from low-SNR data across astrophysics.
#### The evolution of a supermassive binary black hole in an non-spherical nuclear star cluster

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary black hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s < M_p$ in a central part of a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the orbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The subsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal potential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential is mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the secular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular momentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits can experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational waves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study analytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the important effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest possible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of fast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly eccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital period. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale of the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular values of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from the ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the eccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is also noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings, e.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary system inside a massive deformed gas cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 We present SEDONA-GesaRaT, a rapid code for supernova radiative transfer simulation developed based on the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SEDONA. We use a set of atomic physics neural networks (APNN), an artificial intelligence (AI) solver for the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) atomic physics level population calculation, which is trained and validated on 119 1-D type Ia supernova (SN Ia) radiative transfer simulation results showing great computation speed and accuracy. SEDONA-GesaRaT has been applied to the 3-D SN Ia explosion model N100 to perform a 3-D NLTE radiative transfer calculation. The spatially resolved linear polarization data cubes of the N100 model are successfully retrieved with a high signal-to-noise ratio using the integral-based technique (IBT). The overall computation cost of a 3-D NLTE spectropolarimetry simulation using SEDONA-GesaRaT is only $\sim$3000 core-hours, while the previous codes could only finish 1-D NLTE simulation, or 3-D local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) simulation, with similar computation resources. The excellent computing efficiency allows SEDONA-GesaRaT for future large-scale simulations that systematically study the internal structures of supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\sim 60\,000$ solar-mass (\MSun) star-cluster R136 (NGC~2070) in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is the host of at least 55 massive stars ($M \apgt 10$\,\MSun) which move away from the cluster at projected velocities $\gteq 27.5$\,km/s \cite{2024Natur.634..809S}. The origin of the high velocities of such runaway stars have been debated since the 1960s, resulting either from dynamical ejections \citep{1961BAN....15..265B,1961BAN....15..291B} or from supernova explosions \citep{1983ApJ...267..322H}. Due to the Gaia satellite's outstanding precision, we can now retrace the most recently ejected binary star, Mel 34, back to the center of R136 and reconstruct the events that 52\,000 years ago let to its removal from R136, i.e., we establish its dynamical interaction and ejection history. We find that this ejection requires the participation of 5 stars in a strong interaction between a triple composed of the tight massive binary Mel~39 orbited by the star VFTS~590, and the binary star Mel~34. The participation of 5 stars is unexpected because runaway stars were not expected to result from triple interactions \cite{2011Sci...334.1380F}. The deterministic nature of the Newtonian dynamics in the scattering enables us to reconstruct the encounter that ejected Mel~34. We then predict that Mel~39 is a binary star with an 80\,\Msun\, companion star that orbits within $\sim 1^\circ$ in the same plane as Mel~34, and escapes the cluster with a velocity of $\sim 64$\,km/s. The five stars will undergo supernova explosions in the coming 5\,Myr at a distance of $\sim 180$\,pc to $\sim 332$\,pc from their birth location (R\,136). The resulting black hole binaries, however, are not expected to merge within a Hubble time.

 - **Abstract**
 Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) may contribute a significant amount of dust in the early universe. Freshly formed coolant molecules (e.g., CO) and warm dust can be found in CCSNe as early as ~100 d after the explosion, allowing the study of their evolution with time series observations. In the Type II SN 2023ixf, we aim to investigate the temporal evolution of the temperature, velocity, and mass of CO and compare them with other CCSNe, exploring their implications for the dust formation in CCSNe. From observations of velocity profiles of lines of other species (e.g., H and He), we also aim to characterize and understand the interaction of the SN ejecta with pre-existing circumstellar material (CSM). We present a time series of 16 near-infrared spectra of SN 2023ixf from 9 to 307 d, taken with multiple instruments: Gemini/GNIRS, Keck/NIRES, IRTF/SpeX, and MMT/MMIRS. The early (t<70 d) spectra indicate interaction between the expanding ejecta and nearby CSM. At t<20 d, intermediate-width line profiles corresponding to the ejecta-wind interaction are superposed on evolving broad P Cygni profiles. We find intermediate-width and narrow lines in the spectra until t<70 d, which suggest continued CSM interaction. We also observe and discuss high-velocity absorption features in H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles formed by CSM interaction. The spectra contain CO first overtone emission between 199 and 307~d after the explosion. We model the CO emission and find the CO to have a higher velocity (3000-3500 km/s) than that in Type II-pec SN 1987A (1800 - 2000 km/s) during similar phases (t=199-307 d) and a comparable CO temperature to SN 1987A. A flattened continuum at wavelengths greater than 1.5 $\mu$m accompanies the CO emission, indicating the presence of warm dust forming in the ejecta. The warm dust masses are estimated to be in the range of 1.0-2.3$\times$10$^{-5} M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense material in a compact star from a supernova remnant is beyond terrestrial experimentation, so phenomenological modeling is used to match astrophysical observations. This is crucial due to the complex sensitivity of compact star features to dense matter properties. Despite modeling flexibility, certain universal relationships among compact star features hold true, regardless of the matter model. Our study examines these universal relationships, focusing on the moment of inertia, tidal Love number, and quadrupole moment, as well as correlations between non-radial oscillation frequencies and star compactness. We consider baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons. Our findings show that baryonic stars with cores of heavier baryons follow the universal relations, and the f-mode oscillation frequency's universality relative to tidal deformability is notable, with an error margin under 1$\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 The phenomenon of magnetic braking is one of the significant physical effects of the magnetic field in rotating molecular clouds. The physical characteristics of the core can affect on the core rotation rate. and one of the important parameter is the core density structure. According to observation, by regarding the power-law density distribution, $r^{-p}$, for molecular cloud cores, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation, the results show that the increasing of density steepness (i.e., larger $p$) leads to the intensity of the toroidal components of the magnetic field and as a result larger $B_{\phi}$-components lead to more transfer of angular momentum to the outward. Thus, results show that the magnetic braking being stronger with increasing density slope in non-uniform molecular core. For example, the rotation of the system can approximately decrease by fifty percent from $p=0.2$ to $p=1.8$ for a non-uniform system.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the nearby extremely metal-poor galaxy I Zw 18 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS). From optical and mid-IR oxygen emission lines, we measured direct-method abundances for three ionic states of oxygen, including O$^{3+}$/H$^+$. In contrast to previous studies of I Zw 18, the high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical inhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and metal-enriched gas. These are located outside I Zw 18's star-forming complexes having possibly been dispersed beyond these regions via stellar feedback effects. We found that metallicities derived using a single low-ionization density tracer, and T$_{\rm e}$([O II]) derived from a temperature relationship commonly used in high-$z$ galaxy studies, exhibited the largest scatter and underestimated the metallicity compared to those derived using multi-ion densities and estimated T$_{\rm e}$([N II]). Finally, we compared O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundances from a theoretical ionization correction factor (ICF) against observed values and found that the oxygen ICF underestimates the O$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundance by a factor of 2, indicating that either additional ionizing sources are needed or standard stellar population models are unable to produce the requisite ionizing flux.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold brown dwarf atmospheres are good training grounds for analyzing temperate giant planets. WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 (WISE 1738) is an isolated Y0 brown dwarf with a temperature between 350-400 K, at the T-Y transition. While its near-infrared spectrum has been studied, bulk properties and chemistry remain uncertain. We analyze new JWST MIRI medium-resolution spectra (5-18 micron), combined with near-infrared spectra (0.98-2.2 micron) from HST/WFC3 and Gemini/GNIRS, to better constrain WISE 1738's atmosphere and physical parameters. We use Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) with a cloud-free petitRADTRANS model and evaluate results using posterior checks, coverage, and L-C2ST diagnostics. Our retrieval confirms previous constraints on H2O, CH4, and NH3, and for the first time constrains CO, CO2, and 15NH3. We find evidence of disequilibrium chemistry through CO and CO2 abundances not expected under equilibrium. Estimated properties are temperature 402 (+12,-9) K, log g 4.43 (+0.26,-0.34) cm/s2, mass 13 (+11,-7) M_Jup, radius 1.14 (+0.03,-0.03) R_Jup, and bolometric luminosity -6.52 (+0.05,-0.04) log L/L_sun. Evolutionary models suggest an age between 1 and 4 Gyr, consistent with a 6-hour rotation. We place an upper bound on 15NH3, implying a 3-sigma lower limit on the 14N/15N ratio of 275. We also derive a C/O ratio of 1.35 (+0.39,-0.31) and metallicity of 0.34 (+0.12,-0.11), without accounting for oxygen sequestration.
#### All-sky search for short gravitational-wave bursts in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.
