#### Tension of toroidal magnetic field in reconnection plasmoids and relativistic jets

 - **Abstract**
 Toroidal magnetic field is a key ingredient of relativistic jets launched by certain accreting astrophysical black holes, and of plasmoids emerging from the tearing instability during magnetic reconnection, a candidate dissipation mechanism in jets. Tension of toroidal field is an anisotropic force that can compress local energy and momentum densities. We investigate this effect in plasmoids produced during relativistic reconnection initiated from a Harris layer by means of kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations, varying the system size (including 3D cases), magnetisation, or guide field. We find that: (1) plasmoid cores are dominated by plasma energy density for guide fields up to B_z ~ B_0; (2) relaxed 'monster' plasmoids compress plasma energy density only modestly (by factor ~3 above the initial level for drifting particle population); (3) energy density compressions by factors >~10 are achieved during plasmoid mergers, especially with the emergence of secondary plasmoids. This kinetic-scale effect can be combined with a global focusing of the jet Poynting flux along the quasi-cylindrical bunched spine (a proposed jet layer adjacent to the cylindrical core) due to poloidal line bunching (a prolonged effect of tension of the jet toroidal field) to enhance the luminosity of rapid radiation flares from blazars. The case of M87 as a misaligned blazar is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.
#### SOFIA/HAWC+ Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large Area CMZ Exploration Survey. V. The Magnetic Field Strength and Morphology in the Sagittarius C Complex
 - **Authors:** Roy J. Zhao, Mark R. Morris, David T. Chuss, Dylan M. Paré, Jordan A. Guerra, Natalie O. Butterfield, Edward J. Wollack, Kaitlyn Karpovich
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14961

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14961

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the magnetic field strength and morphology in the Sagittarius C complex (Sgr C; G359.43-0.09) in the Milky Way Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) using the 214 $\mu$m polarimetry data acquired with the High-Angular-Resolution Wideband Camera+ (HAWC+) instrument aboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We use several hundred magnetic field pseudovectors in the Sgr C region to trace the projected magnetic field orientation within cold molecular gas clouds, and as is the trend throughout the CMZ, they show a higher polarization fraction toward the periphery of the clouds. We conduct a modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) analysis of individual clouds and find that the sky-plane magnetic field strength varies from highly turbulent regions having inferred strengths of $\sim30~\mu{\rm G}$ to regions of relatively uniform field orientation having strengths of $\sim 1~{\rm mG}$. The magnetic field orientations suggest that outflows from active star-forming regions, such as the extended green object (EGO) G359.43-0.10 and the protostellar source FIR-4 (G359.43+0.02), cause high turbulence in their vicinity. The magnetic field direction is found to be tangential to the surface of the Sgr C HII region, as well as two [CII] emission cavities around this region. Several other features in the vicinity of Sgr C, especially numerous non-thermal filaments (NTFs) and a diffuse source of X-ray emission towards the southwest of the \hii{} region, are discussed with regard to the observed magnetic field pseudovectors.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14964

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14964

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model for analytically calculating gravitational lensing by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. Leveraging the universal behavior of SIDM halos during gravothermal evolution, we calibrate the lensing potential using a fluid simulation, normalizing the evolution time to align with established scenarios. From this potential, we derive explicit equations for the deflection angle and surface density profile, quantifying their deviations from numerical results. Our model builds on the parametric approach of arXiv:2305.16176, providing refinements in the deep core-collapse regime and enabling more comprehensive lensing studies. We explore characteristic lensing features, including critical curves and caustics, for SIDM halos in isolation and within a main halo, tracking their evolution through the gravothermal phase. We also examine signatures in the self-similar regime of core collapsed halos and highlight the role of baryonic effects in realistic halos. The efficiency of our model enables large-scale lensing studies, and we make our implementation publicly available on GitHub to support further research.
#### The Life and Times of Star-Forming Cores: an Analysis of Dense Gas in the STARFORGE Simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15057

 - **Abstract**
 Dense gas in molecular clouds is an important signature of ongoing and future star formation. We identify and track dense cores in the STARFORGE simulations, following the core evolution from birth through dispersal by stellar feedback for typical Milky Way cloud conditions. Only $\sim$8% of cores host protostars, and most disperse before forming stars. The median starless and protostellar core lifetimes are $\sim 0.5-0.6$ Myr and $\sim0.8-1.1$ Myr, respectively, where the protostellar phase lasts $\sim 0.1^{+0.1}_{-0.05}$ Myr. While core evolution is stochastic, we find that virial ratios and linewidths decline in prestellar cores, coincident with turbulent decay. Collapse occurs over $\sim 0.1$ Myr, once the central density exceeds $\gtrsim 10^6$cm$^{-3}$. Starless cores, only, follow linewidth-size and mass-size relations, $\sigma \propto R^{0.3}$ and $M \propto R^1$. The core median mass, radius, and velocity dispersion scale weakly with the cloud magnetic field strength. We cluster the core properties and find that protostellar cores have $>80$% likelihood of belonging to three particular groups that are characterized by high central densities, compact radii, and lower virial parameters. Overall, core evolution appears to be universally set by the interplay of gravity and magnetized turbulence, while stellar feedback dictates protostellar core properties and sets the protostellar phase lifetime.

 - **Abstract**
 The star-forming region Cepheus A hosts a very young star, called HW2, that is the second closest to us growing a dozen times more massive than our Sun. The circumstellar environment surrounding HW2 has long been the subject of much debate about the presence or not of an accretion disk, whose existence is at the basis of our current paradigm of star formation. Here, we answer this long standing question by resolving the gaseous disk component, and its kinematics, through sensitive observations at cm wavelengths of hot ammonia (NH$_3$) with the Jansky Very Large Array. We map the accretion disk surrounding HW2 at radii between 200 and 700 au, showing how fast circumstellar gas collapses and slowly orbits to pile up near the young star at very high rates of $2\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These results, corroborated by state-of-the-art simulations, show that an accretion disk is still efficient in focusing huge mass infall rates near the young star, even when this star has already reached a large mass of 16 M$_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Large-scale surveys across wavelengths, aided by machine learning, have improved the detection of old open clusters in high-extinction Milky Way regions. Aims. We aim to confirm or reject automatically detected open clusters in poorly studied, contaminated regions, refining samples for Galactic disk formation studies. Methods. Using VVVX, 2MASS, and Gaia DR3, we analyzed nine cluster candidates: BH118, BH144, Schuster-MWSC 1756, Saurer 3, FSR 1521, Saurer 2, Haffner 10-FSR 1231, Juchert 12, and Pismis 3. We examined density maps, proper motion diagrams, and photometry to derive physical parameters. Results. We identified star clusters via overdensities in 2MASS, WISE, and DECaPS, confirmed with VVVX and Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation. Using Gaia proper motions, we refined memberships, building a high-likelihood cluster catalog. We derived extinction ($A_{Ks} = 0.07$-$0.50$), color excess ($E(J-Ks) = 0.16$-$0.60$), distances ($D = 2.06$-$8.64$ kpc), and Galactocentric distances ($R_G = 7.69$-$14.81$ kpc). Ages range from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr, metallicity from [Fe/H] = -0.5 to 0.5. Structural parameters include core radii ($r_c = 0.71'$-$5.21'$) and tidal radii ($r_t = 3.4'$-$12.0'$). Conclusions. We confirm the open cluster nature of nine targets, updating their physical parameters.
#### A Critical Examination of the Nested Leaky Box Model for Galactic Cosmic Ray Transport

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15115

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the predictions of the nested leaky box model in detail, in terms of both primary cosmic-ray spectra, spectra of stable and unstable nuclei and antimatter production (positrons and antiprotons). We conclude that the model is in direct conflict with several observational facts and at least in its vanilla version should be considered as ruled out by current data. We also speculate on some possibly interesting implications of the idea that at least a fraction of Galactic grammage may not be accumulated in the journey of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium but rather inside the sources or in regions around them. These speculations will become increasingly more relevant with the higher precision data becoming available at high energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 The astronomical origin of the most energetic galactic cosmic rays and gamma rays is still uncertain. X-ray followup of candidate "PeVatrons", systems producing cosmic rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV, can constrain their spatial origin, identify likely counterparts, and test particle emission models. Using 120 ks of XMM-Newton observations, we report the discovery of a candidate pulsar wind nebula, a possible counterpart for the LHAASO PeVatron J0343+5254u. This extended source has a power law X-ray spectrum with spectral index of 1.9 - softer at greater distance from the center - and asymmetric spatial extension out to 2'. We conduct leptonic modeling of the X-ray and gamma ray radiation from this complex system, showing that a fully leptonic model with elevated IR photon fields can explain the multiwavelength emission from this source, similar to other VHE pulsar wind nebulae; excess gamma ray emissivity not explained by a leptonic model may be due to hadronic interactions in nearby molecular cloud regions, which might also produce detectable astroparticle flux.
#### Detection of molecular clouds in the PeVatron candidate source LHAASO J0341$+$5258 by the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new CO observation survey of LHAASO J0341$+$5258 using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) 45-m telescope. LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is one of the unidentified ultra-high-energy (UHE; E $>$100 TeV) gamma-ray sources detected by LHAASO. Our CO observations were conducted in February and March 2024, with a total observation time of 36 hours, covering the LHAASO source ($\sim$0.3-0.5 degrees in radius) and its surrounding area (1$\times$1.5 degrees). Within the LHAASO source extent, we identified five compact ($<$ 2 pc) molecular clouds at nearby distances ($<$ 1-4 kpc). These clouds can serve as proton-proton collision targets, producing hadronic gamma rays via neutral pion decays. Based on the hydrogen densities (700-5000 cm$^{-3}$) estimated from our CO observations and archived HI data from the DRAO survey, we derived the total proton energy of $W_p$ (E $>$ 1 TeV) $\sim$ 10$^{45}$ erg to account for the gamma-ray flux. One of the molecular clouds appears to be likely associated with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star with an extended CO tail, which may indicate some particle acceleration activities. However, the estimated maximum particle energy below 100 TeV makes the AGB-like star unlikely to be a PeVatron site. We conclude that the UHE emission observed in LHAASO J0341$+$5258 could be due to hadronic interactions between the newly discovered molecular clouds and TeV-PeV protons originating from a distant SNR or due to leptonic emission from a pulsar wind nebula candidate, which is reported in our companion X-ray observation paper (DiKerby et al. 2025).

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring shock velocities is crucial for understanding the energy transfer processes at the shock fronts of supernova remnants (SNRs), including acceleration of cosmic rays. Here we present shock velocity measurements on the SNR N132D, based on the thermal properties of the shock-heated interstellar medium. We apply a self-consistent model developed in our previous work to X-ray data from deep Chandra observations with an effective exposure of $\sim$ 900 ks. In our model, both temperature and ionization relaxation processes in post-shock plasmas are simultaneously calculated, so that we can trace back to the initial condition of the shock-heated plasma to constrain the shock velocity. We reveal that the shock velocity ranges from 800 to 1500 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ with moderate azimuthal dependence. Although our measurement is consistent with the velocity determined by independent proper motion measurements in the south rim regions, a large discrepancy between the two measurements (up to a factor of 4) is found in the north rim regions. This implies that a substantial amount of the kinetic energy has been transferred to the nonthermal component through highly efficient particle acceleration. Our results are qualitatively consistent with the $\gamma$-ray observations of this SNR.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalogue of extended radio sources from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS). Compiled from 56 survey tiles and covering approximately 500 deg$^2$ across the first, third, and fourth Galactic quadrants, the catalogue includes 16534 extended and diffuse sources with areas larger than 5 synthesised beams. Of them, 3891 (24\% of the total) are confidently associated with known Galactic radio-emitting objects in the literature, such as HII regions, supernova remnants, planetary nebulae, luminous blue variables, and Wolf-Rayet stars. A significant fraction of the remaining sources, 5462 (33\%), are candidate extragalactic sources, while 7181 (43\%) remain unclassified. Isolated radio filaments are excluded from the catalogue. The diversity of extended sources underscores MeerKAT's contribution to the completeness of censuses of Galactic radio emitters, and its potential for new scientific discoveries. For the catalogued sources, we derived basic positional and morphological parameters, as well as flux density estimates, using standard aperture photometry. This paper describes the methods followed to generate the catalogue from the original SMGPS tiles, detailing the source extraction, characterisation, and crossmatching procedures. Additionally, we analyse the statistical properties of the catalogued populations
