 - **Abstract**
 Understanding variations in the dust extinction curve is imperative for using dust as a tracer of local structure in the interstellar medium, understanding dust chemistry, and observational color corrections where dust is a nuisance parameter. However, the extinction curve is complicated and exhibits features across a wide range of wavelength scales, from narrow atomic lines and diffuse interstellar bands ("DIBs"), to intermediate-scale and very broad structures ("ISS" and "VBS"), and the overall slope of the optical extinction curve, parameterized by R(V). Robust, population-level studies of variations in these features are only now possible with large, all-sky, spectroscopic surveys. However, these features are often studied independently because they require drastically different spectral resolution. In this work, we couple features with disparate wavelength scales by cross-matching precision catalogs of DIB measurements from APOGEE and Gaia RVS with low-resolution extinction-curve measurements from Gaia XP. Using this combination, we show that there are meaningful correlations between the strengths of extinction-curve features across all wavelength scales. We present a model that statistically explains part of the excess scatter in DIB strength versus extinction, and we show variation in line shapes of two DIBs as a function of R(V). We find that most DIBs increase in strength with increasing R(V) and/or increasing strength of the ISS, though we found one DIB that anomalously decreases in strength with increasing R(V). Using the behavior of the ensemble of DIBs in APOGEE, we present this as the first evidence of systematic chemical variation accompanying R(V) variation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-hot Jupiters are a class of gas-giant exoplanets that show a peculiar combination of thermochemical properties in the form of molecular dissociation, atomic ionization, and inverted thermal structures. Atmospheric characterization of gas giants lying in the transitional regime between hot and ultra-hot Jupiters can help in understanding the physical mechanisms that cause the fundamental transition in atmospheres between the two classes of hot gas giants. Using Doppler spectroscopy with IGRINS on Gemini South (1.4 to 2.5 $\mu$m), we present the day-side high-resolution spectrum of WASP-122b (T$_{\mathrm{day}}$=2258$ \pm$ 54 K), a gas-giant situated at this transition. We detect the signal from H$_{2}$O, based on which we find that WASP-122b has a significantly metal-depleted atmosphere with metallicity log$_{10}$[Z$_{\mathrm{P}}$/Z$_{\odot}$] = $-$1.48$\pm$0.25 dex (0.033$_{-0.016}^{+0.018}$ $\times$ solar), and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio = 0.36$\pm$0.22 (3$\sigma$ upper limit 0.82). Drastically low atmospheric metallicity pushes the contribution function to higher pressures, resulting in the planetary spectral lines to originate from a narrow region around 1 bar where the thermal profile is non-inverted. This is inconsistent with solar composition radiative convective equilibrium (RCTE) which predicts an inverted atmosphere with spectral lines in emission. The sub-solar metallicity and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio is inconsistent with expectations from core-accretion. We find the planetary signal to be significantly shifted in K$_{\mathrm{P}}$ and V$_{\mathrm{sys}}$, which is in tension with the predictions from global circulation models and require further investigation. Our results highlight the detailed information content of high-resolution spectroscopy data and their ability to constrain complex atmospheric thermal structures and compositions of exoplanets.
#### B-fields And dust in interstelLar fiLAments using Dust POLarization (BALLAD-POL): IV. Grain alignment mechanisms in Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2

 - **Abstract**
 The polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission from aligned non-spherical grains provides a powerful tool for tracing magnetic field morphologies and strengths in diffuse interstellar medium to star-forming regions, and constraining dust grain properties and their alignment mechanisms. However, the physics of grain alignment is not yet fully understood. The alignment based on RAdiative Torques (RATs), known as RAT Alignment or RAT-A mechanism is the most acceptable mechanism. In this work, we investigate the grain alignment mechanisms in F13 (F13N and F13C) and F13S filamentary regions of the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarized thermal dust emission observations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\mu$m. We find that the polarization fraction decreases with increasing total intensity and gas column density in each region, termed as polarization hole. We investigate for any role of magnetic field tangling on the observed polarization hole by estimating the polarization angle dispersion function. Our study finds that the polarization hole is not significantly influenced by magnetic field tangling, but majorly due to decrease in RAT alignment efficiency of grains in denser regions. To test whether RAT-A mechanism can reproduce the observational results, we estimate minimum alignment size of grains using RAT theory. Our study finds strong evidence for RAT-A mechanism that can explain the polarization hole. We also find potential hints that the observed higher polarization fractions in some regions of F13 filament can be due to combined effects of both suprathermal rotation by RATs and enhanced magnetic relaxation, supporting the Magnetically-Enhanced RAT (M-RAT) mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Surface radio antenna-based measurements of cosmic-ray air showers present significant computational challenges in accurately reconstructing physics observables, in particular, the depth of shower maximum, X$_{max}$. State-of-the-art template fitting methods rely on extensive simulation libraries, limiting scalability. This work introduces a technique utilizing graph neural networks to reconstruct key air-shower parameters, in particular, direction and shower-core, energy, and X$_{max}$. For training and testing of the networks, we use a CoREAS simulation library made for a future enhancement of IceCube's surface array with radio antennas. The neural networks provide a scalable framework for large-scale data analysis for next-generation astroparticle observatories, such as IceCube-Gen2.
#### Axisymmetric second order perturbations of rotating main sequence stars

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the second order perturbations driven by oscillation modes of rotating stars. Assuming that the typical amplitude $a$ of oscillation modes is small, we expand the perturbed quantities as $Q=Q^{(0)}+Q^{(1)}+Q^{(2)}+\cdots$ where $Q^{(0)}$ represents the equilibrium state and $Q^{(1)}$ and $Q^{(2)}$ are the first order and second order perturbations in $a$, respectively. We assume that the first order perturbations are given by non-axisymmetric modes and the second order perturbations are axisymmetric. For the second order perturbations, we derive a set of linear partial differential equations, which have inhomogeneous terms due to the first order perturbations. For low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes and overstable convective (OsC) modes of main sequence stars, we calculate the second order velocity field $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$ and find that prograde $g$-modes and OsC modes tend to accelerate and retrograde $r$-modes to decelerate $v_\phi^{(2)}$ in the surface equatorial regions where $v_\phi^{(2)}$ is the $\phi$ component of $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$. Using the angular momentum conservation equation derived for waves, we discuss that low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes transport angular momentum between the inner and outer parts of the envelope. For OsC modes in the core resonantly coupled with envelope prograde $g$-modes, we find that they can transport angular momentum from the core to the outer envelope so that they tend to brake the core rotation. We also suggest that the OsC modes provide the outer envelope of rotating stars with the torque enough to support a decretion disc.
#### The GRAND@Auger Prototype for the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection

 - **Abstract**
 As of early 2025, the GRAND Collaboration operates three prototype arrays: GRANDProto300 in China, GRAND@Nançay in France, and GRAND@Auger in Argentina. The GRAND@Auger prototype was established through an agreement between the GRAND and Pierre Auger Collaborations, repurposing ten Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations as GRAND detection units. This setup provides a unique opportunity for coincident air-shower detection, enabling direct event-by-event comparison between GRAND@Auger and the well-established Pierre Auger detectors. Such comparisons allow for a detailed assessment of the detection principle and reconstruction capabilities of GRAND. In this contribution, we present an overview of the commissioning and preliminary results of GRAND@Auger, including the measurement of the Galactic background noise and the detection of the first self-triggered candidate event in coincidence with the Pierre Auger Observatory. Both results underscore the role of GRAND@Auger in advancing the GRAND project and refining the techniques required for large-scale radio detection of ultra-high-energy particles.
#### A search for extremely-high-energy neutrinos with IceCube and implications for the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray proton fraction

 - **Abstract**
 When ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interact with ambient photon backgrounds, a flux of extremely-high-energy (EHE), so-called cosmogenic, neutrinos is produced. The observation of these neutrinos with IceCube can probe the nature of UHECRs. We present a search for EHE neutrinos using $12.6 \, \mathrm{years}$ of IceCube data. The non-observation of neutrinos with energies $\gtrsim 10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $1 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be below $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. This constrains the proton fraction in UHECRs of energy above $30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\%$ if the evolution of the UHECR sources is similar to the star formation rate. Our analysis circumvents uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models in studies of UHECR air showers, which also suggest a heavy composition at such energies.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray shower detection using large radio arrays has gained significant traction in recent years. With massive improvements in signal modelling and microscopic simulations, the analysis of incoming events is still severely limited by the simulation cost of radio emission to interpret the data. In this work, we show that a neural network can be used for simulating such radio pulses. We also demonstrate how such a neural network can be used for $X_\mathrm{max}$ reconstruction, while retaining comparable resolution to using full Monte-Carlo CORSIKA/CoREAS simulations for radio emission.
#### The JWST Weather Report: retrieving temperature variations, auroral heating, and static cloud coverage on SIMP-0136

 - **Abstract**
 SIMP-0136 is a T2.5 brown dwarf whose young age ($200\pm50$~Myr) and low mass ($15\pm3$~M$_{\rm Jup}$) make it an ideal analogue for the directly imaged exoplanet population. With a 2.4 hour period, it is known to be variable in both the infrared and the radio, which has been attributed to changes in the cloud coverage and the presence of an aurora respectively. To quantify the changes in the atmospheric state that drive this variability, we obtained time-series spectra of SIMP-0136 covering one full rotation with both NIRSpec/PRISM and the MIRI/LRS on board JWST. We performed a series of time-resolved atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS in order to measure changes in the temperature structure, chemistry, and cloudiness. We inferred the presence of a ~250 K thermal inversion above 10 mbar of SIMP-0136 at all phases, and propose that this inversion is due to the deposition of energy into the upper atmosphere by an aurora. Statistical tests were performed in order to determine which parameters drive the observed spectroscopic variability. The primary contribution was due to changes in the temperature profile at pressures deeper than 10 mbar, which resulted in variation of the effective temperature from 1243 K to 1248 K. This changing effective temperature was also correlated to observed changes in the abundances of CO2 and H2S, while all other chemical species were consistent with being homogeneous throughout the atmosphere. Patchy silicate clouds were required to fit the observed spectra, but the cloud properties were not found to systematically vary with longitude. This work paints a portrait of an L/T transition object where the primary variability mechanisms are magnetic and thermodynamic in nature, rather than due to inhomogeneous cloud coverage.
#### Fisher Score Matching for Simulation-Based Forecasting and Inference

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07833

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a method for estimating the Fisher score--the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to model parameters--using score matching. By introducing a latent parameter model, we show that the Fisher score can be learned by training a neural network to predict latent scores via a mean squared error loss. We validate our approach on a toy linear Gaussian model and a cosmological example using a differentiable simulator. In both cases, the learned scores closely match ground truth for plausible data-parameter pairs. This method extends the ability to perform Fisher forecasts, and gradient-based Bayesian inference to simulation models, even when they are not differentiable; it therefore has broad potential for advancing cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects. We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such as CO from icy grains.
