 - **Abstract**
 The formation of compact high-redshift star-forming clumps, the physical processes driving their evolution and their potential connection to present-day Globular Clusters are key open questions in galaxy formation. In this work, we aim to shed light on these aspects using the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations with sub-parsec resolution specifically designed to investigate the physical conditions behind the origin of compact stellar systems in high-redshift environments. The simulation object of this study focuses on a dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of a few $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at $z=6.14$, where the spatial resolution reaches 0.3 pc $h^{-1}$. Individual stars are formed directly by sampling the initial mass function with a 100\% star formation efficiency, a setup designed to explore the impact of a high star formation efficiency under high-redshift conditions. The simulation reveals the emergence of numerous stellar clumps with sizes of 1-3 pc, stellar surface densities up to almost $10^4$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and masses predominantly spanning from $10^3$ $M_\odot$ to several $10^4$ $M_\odot$, with a few reaching $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and up to $10^6$ $M_\odot$. All clumps form during intense, short bursts of star formation lasting less than a Myr, often with negligible dark matter content (dark-to-stellar mass ratios below 1 within three times their effective radii). We measure a clear correlation between mass and size, and a clump mass function described by a power-law with a slope of -2. Star formation conditions in the simulation behave similarly to those of a feedback-free starburst scenario, where dense clumps form due to inefficient stellar feedback over small timescales. Notably, some clumps exhibit properties closely resembling those of present-day globular clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Object LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9 (program star) in the thin disk of the Milky Way (MW) is reported as a highly r-process-enhanced (RPE) r-II star with[Eu/Fe]= +1.32 and [Fe/H]= -0.54. The chemical profile of the star reflects the intrinsic composition of the gas cloud present at its birth. Using an abundance decomposition method, we fit 25 elements from the abundance dataset, including 10 heavy neutron capture elements. We explore the astrophysical origin of the elements in this star through its abundance ratios and component ratios. We find that the contributions from the massive stars played a significant role in the production of light elements in the program star. Our analysis reveals that the heavy neutron-capture elements are produced purely by the main r-process. However, the adopted main r-process model does not adequately fit the observed data, suggesting another main r-process pattern may exist.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relativistic jet of the powerful radio-emitting blazar J1429+5406 at redshift z=3.015. Our understanding of jet kinematics in z>3 quasars is still rather limited, based on a sample of less than about 50 objects. The blazar J1429+5406 was observed at a high angular resolution using the method of very long baseline interferometry over more than two decades, between 1994 and 2018. These observations were conducted at five radio frequencies, covering a wide range from 1.7 to 15 GHz. The outer jet components at ~20-40 milliarcsecond (mas) separations from the core do not show discernible apparent motion. On the other hand, three jet components within the central 10 mas region exhibit significant proper motion in the range of (0.045-0.16)mas/year, including one that is among the fastest-moving jet components at z>3 known to date. Based on the proper motion of the innermost jet component and the measured brightness temperature of the core, we estimated the Doppler factor, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the inclination angle of the jet with respect to the line of sight. The core brightness temperature is at least 3.6 x 10^{11} K, well exceeding the equipartition limit, indicating Doppler-boosted radio emission. The low jet inclination (<5.4 deg) firmly places J1429+5406 into the blazar category.

 - **Abstract**
 High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V > 30 km/s. When the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the interaction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of shocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium, heating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools, producing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape structures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar bowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons up to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most probably synchrotron which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we model the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to produce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies: 1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by means of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and transport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We include in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main conclusions are i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are important at the lowest frequency considered, ii) inferring the local magnetic field direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, iii) thermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure and surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies, and iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01~{\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.
#### Cosmic Ray Superdiffusion and Mirror Diffusion in Partially Ionized and Turbulent Medium

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding cosmic ray (CR) diffusion in a partially ionized medium is both crucial and challenging. In this study, we investigate CR superdiffusion in turbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid simulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence of neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR propagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity, density, and magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes steeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. We also identify an intermediate coupling regime in which neutrals remain partially coupled with ions, leading to a steepening of kinetic energy spectra in both fluids. Shocks can enhance the neutral-ion coupling, thereby reducing the differences between neutral and ion density structures. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field fluctuations substantially decreases pitch angle scattering, which increases CR parallel mean free paths. As a result, CR perpendicular transport transitions between two distinct superdiffusive regimes: a scattering-dominated regime with perpendicular displacement proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a scattering-free regime dominated by magnetic field line wandering, with perpendicular displacement scaling as $t^{3/2}$. When the pitch angle is large, the effects of magnetic mirroring, naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, become significant, enhancing the confinement (but not fully trapping) of CRs and inducing oscillations in their perpendicular displacement. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating two-fluid effects for accurately modeling CR transport in partially ionized environments such as molecular clouds and dense interstellar clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 3D Galactic magnetic fields are critical for understanding the interstellar medium, Galactic foreground polarization, and the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Leveraging recent theoretical insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we introduce a deep learning framework to predict the full 3D magnetic field structure-including the plane-of-sky (POS) position angle, line-of-sight (LOS) inclination, magnetic field strength, sonic Mach number ($M_s$), and Alfvén Mach number ($M_A$)-from spectroscopic H~I observations. The deep learning model is trained on synthetic H~I emission data generated from multiphase 3D MHD simulations. We then apply the trained model to observational data from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey, presenting maps of 3D magnetic field orientation, magnetic field strength, $M_s$, and $M_A$ for two H~I clouds, a low-velocity cloud (LVC) and an intermediate-velocity cloud (IVC), which overlap in the POS yet reside at different LOS distances. The deep-learning-predicted POS magnetic field position angles align closely with those determined using the velocity gradient technique, whose integrated results are consistent with independent measurements from Planck 353~GHz polarization data. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning approaches as powerful tools for modeling the 3D distributions of 3D Galactic magnetic fields and turbulence properties throughout the Galaxy.
#### Origin of the Multi-Phase Interstellar Medium: the Effects of Turbulence and Magnetic Field

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a multiphase gas, including the warm neutral medium (WNM), the unstable neutral medium (UNM), and the cold neutral medium (CNM). While significant attention has been devoted to understanding the WNM and CNM, the formation of a substantial fraction of the UNM, with temperatures ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand Kelvin, remains less well understood. In this study, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations of turbulent multiphase ISM to investigate the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in regulating the multiphase ISM. Our results confirm that turbulence is crucial in redistributing energy and producing the UNM. The turbulent mixing effect smooths the phase diagram, flattens the pressure-density relationship, and increases the fraction of gas in the UNM. We find that magnetic fields not only contribute to sustaining the UNM but also influence the dynamics and distribution of gas across all phases. Magnetic fields introduce anisotropy to the turbulent cascade, reducing the efficiency of turbulent mixing in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. We find the anisotropy results in a less flat phase diagram compared to hydrodynamical cases. Furthermore, the inclusion of magnetic fields shallowens the second-order velocity structure functions across multiple ISM phases, suggesting that more small-scale fluctuations are driven. These fluctuations contribute to the formation of the UNM by altering the energy cascade and thermodynamic properties of the gas. Our findings suggest that the combined effects of turbulence and magnetic fields are important in regulating the multiphase ISM.
#### Rapid formation of a very massive star >50000 $M_\odot$ and subsequently an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$. Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster. Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement. Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH. Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of extra-terrestrial life is one of the ultimate goals for future exoplanet-seeking missions, with one major challenge being the presence of 'exozodiacal' dust near target stars or within their habitable zone. Therefore, it is critical to identify which stars possess exozodiacal dust and quantify their emission levels. In this study, we conducted a search for exozodi candidates within 10 parsecs using the Reyl'e sample. We performed proper motion calculations and cross-matched the sample with the WISE and 2MASS database, resulting in 339 preliminary target samples. We further analysed the infrared radiation characteristics of these targets, using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to predict photometric flux levels in the infrared and searching for 3sigma excesses in the WISE W3 band. During further selection processes, we applied various analysis methods to perform rigorous validation. We identified five exozodi candidates all of which are brown dwarfs (BDs). Given the clustering in candidate spectral types, we expect that these are not true exozodi candidates, rather the apparent excess arises from the inability of the BD photosphere models to accurately represent the SEDs of objects at the L-T transition. Indeed, for the object DENIS J025503.3-470049, excess is likely due to silicate clouds in the BD atmosphere. We suggest that a more stringent 5sigma excess is required to infer excess for this spectral type. The detection rate (0/339) in our sample shows that less than 1% M stars have exozodi above 21% excess levels. This is consistent with the rate of exozodi at similar level towards FGK stars in the Kennedy & Wyatt sample (25/24,174). We provide upper limits on the 12 micron exozodi emission for the sample, which is typically at 21% relative to the star. For most stars, in particular the low mass M stars, this is the first such upper limit in the literature.
#### The Effect of Luminosity Outbursts on the Abundance of Pebbles and Their Ice Mantles in Protoplanetary Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Centimeter-sized dust grains-pebbles-are necessary for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability, they play an important role in forming protoplanetary cores and giant planets, as well as enriching their atmospheres with chemical elements. This work investigates the effect of luminosity outbursts on the abundance of pebbles and their ice mantles in protoplanetary disks. We perform global simulations of formation and evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disk using the 2D hydrodynamic thin-disk FEOSAD code, which self-consistently reproduces luminosity outbursts. The model includes thermal balance, dust evolution and its interaction with gas, development of magnetorotational instability, adsorption and desorption of four volatile compounds (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO), and the feedback of ice mantles on dust fragmentation properties. We show that luminosity outbursts have a stronger effect on the positions of CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO snowlines compared to the water snowline. This is because the H$_2$O snowline falls within the viscous heating dominated region during early disk evolution stages, while snowlines of other molecules are located in regions dominated by stellar irradiation heating and are thus more sensitive to temperature changes during outbursts. Nevertheless, luminosity outbursts reduce the total amount of pebbles in the disk by half due to destruction of dust aggregates into monomers following the loss of water ice that binds the aggregates together. Pebble recovery occurs over several thousand years after the outburst ends due to collisional coagulation, with recovery timescales significantly exceeding water freeze-out times. Ice mantle desorption occurs in a complex non-axisymmetric 2D region of the disk, associated with spiral substructure formation during early evolution of gravitationally unstable disks.
#### Clouds can enhance direct imaging detection of O2 and O3 on terrestrial exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Clouds are often considered a highly uncertain barrier for detecting biosignatures on exoplanets, especially given intuition gained from transit surveys. However, for direct imaging reflected light observations, clouds could increase the observational signal by increasing reflected light. Here we constrain the impact of clouds on the detection of O2 and O3 by a direct imaging telescope such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) using observations simulated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We first perform sensitivity tests to show that low clouds enhance O2 and O3 detectability while high clouds diminish it, and the effect is greater when cloud particles are smaller. We next apply clouds produced by the cloud microphysics model CARMA with varied planetary parameters and clouds drawn from observations of different types of clouds on Earth to PSG. We find that clouds are likely to increase the SNR of O2 and O3 for terrestrial exoplanets under a wide range of scenarios. This work provides important constraints on the impact of clouds on observations by telescopes including HWO.
#### Gravitationally Bound Gas Determines Star Formation in the Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form from molecular gas under complex conditions influenced by multiple competing physical mechanisms, such as gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. However, accurately identifying the fraction of gas actively involved in star formation remains challenging. Using dust continuum observations from the Herschel Space Observatory, we derived column density maps and their associated probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). Assuming the power-law component in the N-PDFs corresponds to gravitationally bound (and thus star-forming) gas, we analyzed a diverse sample of molecular clouds spanning a wide range of mass and turbulence conditions. This sample included 21 molecular clouds from the solar neighborhood ($d<$500 pc) and 16 high-mass star-forming molecular clouds. For these two groups, we employed the counts of young stellar objects (YSOs) and mid-/far-infrared luminosities as proxies for star formation rates (SFR), respectively. Both groups revealed a tight linear correlation between the mass of gravitationally bound gas and the SFR, suggesting a universally constant star formation efficiency in the gravitationally bound gas phase. The star-forming gas mass derived from threshold column densities ($N_{\mbox {threshold}}$) varies from cloud to cloud and is widely distributed over the range of $\sim$1--17$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on N-PDF analysis. But in solar neighborhood clouds, it is in rough consistency with the traditional approach using $A_{\rm V}$ $\ge$ 8 mag. In contrast, in high turbulent regions (e.g., the Central Molecular Zone) where the classical approach fails, the gravitationally bound gas mass and SFR still follow the same correlation as other high-mass star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Our findings also strongly support the interpretation that gas in the power-law component of the N-PDF is undergoing self-gravitational collapse to form stars.
#### Why is the Star Formation Rate Proportional to Dense Gas Mass?

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most profound empirical laws of star formation is the Gao-Solomon relation, a linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense molecular gas mass. It is puzzling how the complicated physics in star-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using archival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Observations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and high-mass star-forming regions. We discovered a significant correlation $\log(M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}/M_{\odot}) = 0.506 \log(M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}/M_{\odot})-0.32$. Our discovered $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$-$M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon relation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ are tightly related through $\log({\rm SFR}/(M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \log(m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})-5.80$. Intriguingly, both requirements have been suggested by previous theoretical studies (c.f. Yan et al. 2017). Based on this result, we hypothesize that the Gao-Solomon relation is a consequence of combining the following three non-trivial relations (i) SFR vs. $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$, (ii) $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ vs. $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$, and (iii) $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ vs. $M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$. This finding may open a new possibility to understand the Gao-Solomon relation in an analytic sense.
