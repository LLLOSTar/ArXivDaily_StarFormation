 - **Abstract**
 Supersonic isothermal turbulence is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. This work presents high-resolution AREPO hydrodynamical simulations of isolated shocks moving through supersonic turbulence to study the development and evolution of turbulence in the pre- and post-shock regions. We find that shocks can amplify turbulent energy in the post-shock region while inducing a preferential orientation for the vorticity. This results in the creation of anisotropic turbulence in the post-shock region. Turbulent energy and dissipation are also strongly enhanced near the shock front. By applying typical scalings from the cold neutral medium to simulations, we find that shocks moving into turbulence on the scale of superbubbles can generate compressive flows on the order of $10^{3} M_{\odot}$/Myr. Our results also show good agreement with related studies on turbulent fluctuations generated by shocks in pure fluid mechanics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is one of four science instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which began routine operations in July 2022. As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant targets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science goals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the simultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the field of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000 individually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters. The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce unwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting valuable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the affected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to prevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces NIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of masking while reliably suppressing the short's effects. More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical procedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This experience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected rows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of multiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost. As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain relevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation operations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning, and describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued science productivity from this unique payload.
#### Hyperactive Magnetar Eruptions: Giant Flares, Baryon Ejections, and FRBs

 - **Abstract**
 Young neutron stars born with magnetic fields $B\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G become hyperactive as the field inside the star evolves through ambipolar diffusion on a timescale $\sim 10^9$ s. We simulate this process numerically and find that it can eject magnetic loops from the star. The internal magnetic field first diffuses to the crust surrounding the liquid core and then erupts from the surface, taking a significant amount of crustal material with it. The eruption involves magnetic reconnection, generating a giant gamma-ray flare. A significant fraction of the eruption energy is carried by the neutron-rich crustal material, which must go through a phase of decompression and nuclear heating. The massive ejecta should produce additional emission components after the giant flare, including radioactively powered gamma-rays, optical emission, and much later a radio afterglow. The predicted eruptions may rarely happen in observed magnetars in our galaxy, which are relatively old and rarely produce giant flares. The model can, however, explain the extremely powerful flare from SGR 1806-20 in December 2004, its ejecta mass, and afterglow. More active, younger magnetars may produce frequent crustal eruptions and form unusual nebulae. Such hyperactive magnetars are candidates for the central engines of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). We argue that each eruption launches an ultrarelativistic magnetosonic pulse leading the ejecta and steepening into a relativistic shock capable of emitting an FRB.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{0}$) and jet half-opening angle ($\theta_{\rm jet}$) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are critical physical parameters for understanding the dynamical evolution of relativistic jets and the true energy release of GRBs. We compile a sample of 89 GRBs that exhibit an onset bump feature in their early optical or GeV light curves, 42 of which also display a jet break feature, and derive their $\Gamma_{0}$ and $\theta_{\rm jet}$ values. Using this sample, we re-eaxmine the correlations between $\Gamma_{0}$ and the prompt emission parameters (isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso}$, peak luminosity $L_{\rm iso}$, and peak energy $E_{\rm p}$). Our results confirm the previously reported $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$), $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$, and $E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$)$-$$E_{\rm p}$$-$$\Gamma_{0}$ relations for both homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) and wind density profiles (Wind). Notably, we find that the short GRB 090510 complies with the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ relation, but significantly deviates from the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$L_{\rm iso}$ and $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$ relations. We systematically investigate the influence of $\theta_{\rm jet}$ on $\Gamma_{0}$ and find a weak dependence. Additionally, we report, for the first time, three new three-parameter correlations, i.e., $E_{\rm iso}$ (or $L_{\rm iso}$, $E_{\rm p,z}$)$-$$\Gamma_{0}$$-$$\theta_{\rm jet}$ correlations. In addition, we further explore the relations between the initial Lorentz factor and the jet-corrected energy. We also find that the jet-corrected correlations remain significant, suggesting that these relations are intrinsic to the physical nature of GRBs. However, the increased dispersion after correction implies that underlying differences persist among individual GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 $\gamma$-ray pulsar halos, formed by inverse Compton scattering of electrons and positrons propagating in the pulsar-surrounding interstellar medium with background photons, serve as an ideal probe for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation on small scales (typically tens of parsecs). While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as normal diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond normal diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous coefficients. PHECT is ready for the increasingly precise observational data and the rapidly growing sample of pulsar halos.

 - **Abstract**
 Color ratios derived from molecular hydrogen emissions provide valuable diagnostics for the energy of precipitating electrons and the structure of the auroral atmosphere. We aim to characterize the horizontal and vertical variability of hydrocarbon absorption in Jupiter's auroral atmosphere using ultraviolet data from the Juno-UVS spectrograph and to investigate potential departures from the expected structure. We constructed color ratio maps sensitive to CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions for perijoves (PJs) 6 and 10, two of Juno's close approaches to Jupiter, by integrating auroral H$_2$ emission over hydrocarbon-sensitive spectral intervals. For CH$_4$, we redefined the absorbed spectral band, replacing the traditionally used 125-130 nm interval with 135-140 nm, in order to mitigate higher-order calibration issues. In regions of intense auroral brightness, we developed a correction method to account for spectral distortion due to detector non-linearities at high fluxes. CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions generally follow the expected vertical distribution, with the CH$_4$ density extending to higher altitudes than C$_2$H$_2$. However, several localized regions show unexpected spatial distribution of the absorption. In PJ6, such anomalies are attributed to instrumental non-linearities. After correction, the CR distributions become consistent with standard hydrocarbon vertical distributions. In PJ10, however, some anomalous patterns persist despite correction. Spectral modeling indicates that these can be explained by modifying the relative abundances of CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$, suggesting horizontal compositional variability and possible deviations in homopause altitude between species. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for local atmospheric composition when interpreting ultraviolet auroral spectra and retrieving electron energy distributions.
#### The Hidden Role of Anisotropies in Shaping Structure Formation in Cosmological N-Body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically generated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a correlated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the Zel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point statistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces subtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These anisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through directional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances. Analyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial redshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but are amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that persist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our findings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging from the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice -- not genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model. These results underscore the importance of critically reassessing how initial conditions are constructed, particularly when probing the large-scale, quasi-linear regime of structure formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed spectrophotometric study of nova LMCN 2009-05a, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Photometric observations reveal a dust dip in the optical light curve, classifying it as a D-class nova. Light curve analysis yields t2 and t3 decline times of approximately 46 and 80 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of moderately fast novae. Spectroscopic observations cover multiple phases, including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are initially dominated by hydrogen Balmer and Fe II lines with P-Cygni profiles, which later transition into pure emission. During the optical minimum, a discrete absorption feature was observed in the H{\alpha} and [O I] line profiles. The physical and chemical properties during the early decline and nebular phases were analyzed using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Dust temperature, mass, and grain size were estimated through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to the WISE data. On day 395 post-outburst, we estimate the dust temperature to be approximately 700 K. Additionally, we examined the correlation between dust condensation time (tcond ) and t2 for LMC novae, finding a trend consistent with previous studies of Galactic novae.

 - **Abstract**
 Methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been hypothesised to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM) through their 3.4 and 6.9 $\mu$m absorption bands. To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs, the simplest, toluene ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This demonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards atomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter its chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction between H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene leads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane ($\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of H-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further hydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of cyclohexane ($\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may be fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a smaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This likely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low flexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization. The removal of the methyl group at high H-atom fluences provides a top down formation route to smaller molecules with the possibility of the formation of a radical cyclohexane combining with other species in an interstellar environment to form prebiotic molecules.
