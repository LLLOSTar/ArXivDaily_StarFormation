#### Jupiter Evolutionary Models Incorporating Stably Stratified Regions

 - **Abstract**
 We address the issue of which broad set of initial conditions for the planet Jupiter best matches the current presence of a ``fuzzy core" of heavy elements, while at the same time comporting with measured parameters such as its effective temperature, atmospheric helium abundance, radius, and atmospheric metallicity. Our focus is on the class of fuzzy cores that can survive convective mixing to the present day and on the unique challenges of an inhomogeneous Jupiter with stably-stratified regions now demanded by the \textit{Juno} gravity data. Hence, using the new code \texttt{APPLE}, we attempt to put a non-adiabatic Jupiter into an evolutionary context. This requires not only a mass density model, the major relevant byproduct of the \textit{Juno} data, but a thermal model that is subject to interior heat transport, a realistic atmospheric flux boundary, a helium rain algorithm, and the latest equation of state. The result is a good fit to most major thermal, compositional, and structural constraints that still preserve a fuzzy core and that should inform future more detailed models of the current Jupiter in the context of its evolution from birth.

 - **Abstract**
 We deploy the new Arkenstone galactic wind model in cosmological simulations for the first time, allowing us to robustly resolve the evolution and impact of high specific energy winds. In a (25$\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc)$^3$ box we perform a set of numerical experiments that systematically vary the mass and energy loadings of such winds, finding that their energy content is the key parameter controlling the stellar to dark matter mass ratio. Increasing the mass loading, at fixed energy, actually results in mildly enhanced star formation, counter to prevailing wisdom but in agreement with recent analytic models. Of the simple parametrisations that we test, we find that an energy loading that scales inversely with halo mass best matches a wide range of observations, and can do so with mass loadings drastically lower than those in most previous cosmological simulations. In this scenario, much less material is ejected from the interstellar medium. Instead, winds both heat gas in the circumgalactic medium, slowing infall onto the galaxy, and also drive shocks beyond the virial radius, preventing accretion onto the halo in the first place. We have not yet tied the mass and energy loadings to high-resolution simulations (a key goal of the Learning the Universe collaboration); however, we can already report that a much lower fraction of the available supernova energy is needed in preventative galaxy regulation than required by ejective wind feedback models such as IllustrisTNG.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The duration of star formation (SF) in globular clusters (GCs) is an essential aspect for understanding their formation. Contrary to previous presumptions that all stars above 8 M explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), recent evidence suggests a more complex scenario. Aims. We analyse iron spread observations from 55 GCs to estimate the number of CCSNe explosions before SF termination, thereby determining the SF duration. This work for the first time takes the possibility of failed CCSNe into account, when estimating the SF duration. Methods. Two scenarios are considered: one where all stars explode as CCSNe and another where only stars below 20 M lead to CCSNe, as most CCSN models predict that no failed CCSNe happen below 20 M . Results. This establishes a lower ($\approx$ 3.5 Myr) and an upper ($\approx$ 10.5 Myr) limit for the duration of SF. Extending the findings of our previous paper, this study indicates a significant difference in SF duration based on CCSN outcomes, with failed CCSNe extending SF by up to a factor of three. Additionally, a new code is introduced to compute the SF duration for a given CCSN model. Conclusions. The extended SF has important implications on GC formation, including enhanced pollution from stellar winds and increased binary star encounters. These results underscore the need for a refined understanding of CCSNe in estimating SF durations and the formation of multiple stellar populations in GCs.
#### The influence of the cloud virial parameter on the initial mass function

 - **Abstract**
 Crucial for star formation is the interplay between gravity and turbulence. The observed cloud virial parameter, $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$, which is the ratio of twice the turbulent kinetic energy to the gravitational energy, is found to vary significantly in different environments, where the scatter among individual star-forming clouds can exceed an order of magnitude. Therefore, a strong dependence of the initial mass function (IMF) on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ may challenge the notion of a universal IMF. To determine the role of $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ on the IMF, we compare the star-particle mass functions obtained in high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations including jet and heating feedback, with $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}=0.0625$, $0.125$, and $0.5$. We find that varying $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ from $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}\sim0.5$ to $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}<0.1$ shifts the peak of the IMF to lower masses by a factor of $\sim2$ and increases the star formation rate by a similar factor. The dependence of the IMF and star formation rate on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is non-linear, with the dependence subsiding at $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}<0.1$. Our study shows a systematic dependence of the IMF on $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$. Yet, it may not be measurable easily in observations, considering the uncertainties, and the relatively weak dependence found in this study.
#### Bridging Scales: Coupling the galactic nucleus to the larger cosmic environment

 - **Abstract**
 Coupling black hole (BH) feeding and feedback involves interactions across vast spatial and temporal scales that is computationally challenging. Tracking gas inflows and outflows from kilo-parsec scales to the event horizon for non-spinning BHs in the presence of strong magnetic fields, Cho et al. (2023, 2024) report strong suppression of accretion on horizon scales and low (2%) feedback efficiency. In this letter, we explore the impact of these findings for the supermassive BHs M87* and Sgr A*, using high-resolution, non-cosmological, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) model. With no feedback, we find rapid BH growth due to "cooling flows," and for 2% efficiency feedback, while accretion is suppressed, the rates still remain higher than constraints from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. 2021, 2022) for M87* and Sgr A*. To match EHT observations of M87*, a feedback efficiency greater than 15% is required, suggesting the need to include enhanced feedback from BH spin. Similarly, a feedback efficiency of $>15\%$ is needed for Sgr A* to match the estimated observed star formation rate of $\lesssim 2 {\rm M_\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. However, even with 100% feedback efficiency, the accretion rate onto Sgr A* matches with EHT data only on rare occasions in the simulations, suggesting that Sgr A* is likely in a temporary quiescent phase currently. Bridging accretion and feedback across scales, we conclude that higher feedback efficiency, possibly due to non-zero BH spin, is necessary to suppress "cooling flows" and match observed accretion and star formation rates in M87* and Sgr A*.
#### The cloud cover and meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site on the Tibetan Plateau

 - **Abstract**
 The cloud cover and meteorological parameters serve as fundamental criteria for the qualification of an astronomical observatory working in optical and infrared wavelengths. In this paper, we present a systematic assessment of key meteorological parameters at the Lenghu site. The datasets adopted in this study includes the meteorological parameters collected at the local weather stations at the site and in the Lenghu Town, the sky brightness at the local zenith acquired by the Sky Quality Meters and night sky all-sky images from a digital camera, the ERA5 reanalysis database and global climate monitoring data. From 2019 to 2023, the fractional observable time of photometric condition is 69.70%, 74.97%, 70.26%, 74.27% and 65.12%, respectively. The fractional observing time is inversely correlated with surface air temperature, relative humidity, precipitable water vapor, and dew temperature, demonstrating that the observing conditions are influenced by these meteorological parameters. Large-scale air-sea interactions affect the climate at Lenghu site, which in fact delivers a clue to understand the irregularity of 2023. Specifically, precipitable water vapor at Lenghu site is correlated to both the westerly wind index and the summer North Atlantic Oscillation index, the yearly average temperature of Lenghu site is observed to increase significantly during the occurrence of a strong El Niño event and the relative humidity anomaly at Lenghu site is correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index. The decrease of fractional observing time in 2023 was due to the ongoing strong El Niño event and relevant global climate change. We underscore the substantial role of global climate change in regulating astronomical observing conditions and the necessity for long-term continuous monitoring of the astronomical meteorological parameters at Lenghu site.
#### Applying the Velocity Gradient Technique in NGC 1333: Comparison with Dust Polarization Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields (B-fields) are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM), and they play an essential role in the formation of molecular clouds and subsequent star formation. However, B-fields in interstellar environments remain challenging to measure, and their properties typically need to be inferred from dust polarization observations over multiple physical scales. In this work, we seek to use a recently proposed approach called the Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) to study B-fields in star-forming regions and compare the results with dust polarization observations in different wavelengths. The VGT is based on the anisotropic properties of eddies in magnetized turbulence to derive B-field properties in the ISM. We investigate that this technique is synergistic with dust polarimetry when applied to a turbulent diffused medium for the purpose of measuring its magnetization. Specifically, we use the VGT on molecular line data toward the NGC~1333 star-forming region ($\rm ^{12}CO$, $\rm ^{13}CO$, $\rm C^{18}O$, and $\rm N_{2}H^{+}$), and we compare the derived B-field properties with those inferred from 214 and 850~$\mu$m dust polarization observations of the region using SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/POL-2, respectively. We estimate both the inclination angle and the 3D Alfvénic Mach Number $M_A$ from the molecular line gradients. Crucially, testing this technique on gravitationally bound, dynamic, and turbulent regions, and comparing the results with those obtained from polarization observations at different wavelength, such as the plane-of-the-sky field orientation, is an important test on the applicability of the VGT in various density regimes of the ISM.
#### Exploring the supernova remnant contribution to the first LHAASO source catalog via passively illuminated interstellar clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) are considered as the most promising source class to account for the bulk of the Galactic cosmic-ray flux. Yet amongst the population of ultra-high energy (UHE) sources that has recently emerged, due to high-altitude particle detector experiments such as LHAASO and HAWC, remarkably few are associated with known SNRs. These observations might well indicate that the highest energy particles would escape the remnant early during the shock evolution as a result of its reduced confinement capabilities. This flux of escaping particles may then encounter dense targets (gas and dust) for hadronic interactions in the form of both atomic and molecular material such as interstellar clouds, thereby generating a UHE gamma-ray flux. We explore such a scenario here, considering known SNRs in a physically driven model for particle escape, and as coupled to molecular clouds in the Galaxy. Our analysis allows the investigation of SNR-illuminated clouds in coincidence with sources detected in the first LHAASO catalogue. Indeed, the illuminated interstellar clouds may contribute to the total gamma-ray flux from several unidentified sources, as we discuss here. Yet we nevertheless find that further detailed studies will be necessary to verify or refute this scenario of passive UHE gamma-ray sources in future.
#### Multiple collisions in N59 bubble: Sequential cloud-cloud collisions
 - **Authors:** En Chen, Xi Chen, Xuepeng Chen, Min Fang, Qianru He

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13742

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13742

 - **Abstract**
 We report that the gas components in the N59 bubble suffered from sequential multiple cloud-cloud collision (CCC) processes. The molecular gas in the N59 bubble can be decomposed into four velocity components, namely Cloud A [95, 108] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud B [86, 95] km s$^{-1}$, Cloud C [79, 86] km s$^{-1}$ and Cloud D [65, 79] km s$^{-1}$. Four CCC processes occurred among these four velocity components, i.e., Cloud A vs. Cloud B, Cloud A vs. Cloud C, Cloud C vs. Cloud D, and Cloud A vs. Cloud D. Using Spitzer MIR and UKIDSS NIR photometric point source catalogs, we identified 514 YSO candidates clustered in 13 YSO groups, and most of them (~60$\%$) were located at the colliding interfaces, indicating that they were mainly triggered by these four CCC processes. We also found that these four collisions occurred in a time sequential order: the earliest and most violent collision occurred between Cloud A and Cloud D about 2 Myr ago, then Cloud B collided with Cloud A about 1 Myr ago, and finally, Cloud C collided with Clouds A and D simultaneously about 0.4 Myr ago.
#### On the crystallization onset in white dwarfs

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13745

 - **Abstract**
 Thermal evolution of the central region of a $0.9 \, M_\odot$ C/O white dwarf at the initial stage of the ion mixture crystallization is studied by numerically solving the heat equation on a fine spatial and temporal grid and by including a detailed treatment of the latent heat release. Formation of two spherical shells is observed. The outer one surrounds a region where crystallization has begun. The inner one bounds a fully solidified core which has exhausted its latent heat. The region between the shells is partially liquid and partially solid. It gradually emits the latent heat of crystallization and also it releases light elements (carbon) in the process of element redistribution, accompanying the mixture solidification. Assuming that all released light elements cross the outer shell, we have estimated their flux induced by the mixture crystallization. The resulting flux is not divergent and is much smaller than an estimate derived from the growth rate of the fully crystallized core.
