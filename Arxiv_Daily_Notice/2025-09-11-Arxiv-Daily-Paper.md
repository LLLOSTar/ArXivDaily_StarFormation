#### X-ray Transmission Through Photoionized Gas with Moderate Thomson Optical Depth

 - **Abstract**
 We model the absorption of X-rays by gas obscuring the source and photoionized by it. We consider a broad range of column densities, including both Thomson-thin and Thomson-thick media. For the Thomson thin regime, we derive a simple criterion, based on the source luminosity and spectrum and the medium radius and column density, that distinguish between the following cases: (i) The absorption can be modeled well by a neutral medium; (ii) The radiation ionizes its way through the medium and no absorption is expected; and (iii) A detailed model is required because the column density inferred from modeling the absorption with a neutral gas is much lower than the actual column density, or because the absorption features cannot be fitted by a neutral absorber. We derive the criterion analytically using a toy model of hydrogen and oxygen, and calibrate it for realistic compositions with metallicities in the range $Z/Z_{\odot}=0.01-50$, using CLOUDY. We generalize the model to the Thomson-thick regime, where we consider, alongside photoabsorption, electron scattering, Compton heating, Comptonization, and photon degradation. In this case, the emergent spectrum depends on the boundary condition experienced by photons scattered back towards the source. We discuss the effect of a reflective boundary and a reprocessing boundary. We provide simple criteria for the expected absorption state, and discuss additional effects that alter the spectrum. The main motivation of our modeling is X-ray emission from supernovae interacting with circumstellar medium; however, we expect it to be useful to many other applications.
#### Toward a 2D H I Map of the Local Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 Obtaining a complete census of gas in the local interstellar medium (<100 pc) is challenging given the limited available tracers of the warm, partially-ionized medium. Medium-to-high resolution UV absorption spectroscopy toward individual nearby stars is the primary method used, and incomplete spatial sampling of this complex medium makes a global map of the material difficult. Using H I column density measurements derived from H I Lyman alpha spectroscopy toward 164 stars inside 100 pc, we have generated 2D spatially-interpolated N(HI) maps for different distance shells. Based on the area-weighted sky averages, we find that sightlines inside 10 pc typically have log N(HI) ~ 17.9. For greater distance shells, log N(HI) increases to 18.3 (10-20 pc), then to 18.4 (20-70 pc), and finally increasing to 18.6 (70-100 pc). This last increase is likely associated with the detection of the Local Bubble boundary, thus making the plateau of column density from 20-70 pc notable and suggestive of the rarity of warm LISM material beyond ~10-20 pc. We estimate that the uncertainties associated with N(HI) values inferred from the interpolated sky maps are approximately inversely correlated with the number of samples in each distance shell and are in the range of 0.20-0.48 dex, compared to 0.01-0.30 dex typically determined from direct Lyman alpha observations. We discuss the impact of these uncertainties on ISM corrections of EUV and Lyman alpha observations for nearby stars. Denser spatial sampling of the sky via UV absorption spectroscopy of nearby stars is required to improve the accuracy of these N(HI) estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 In the multiverse hypothesis, a range of universes exist with differing values of our physical constants. Here, we investigate how the probabilities of observing our values of these constants depend on the assumptions made about the theories governing particle physics and cosmology, along with habitability. The particle physics effects we consider include constraints on the Higgs vacuum expectation value from big bang nucleosynthesis and supernovae, grand unified theories (GUTs), and standard model stability. Cosmology effects we consider are different theories of dark matter and baryogenesis, and for galactic habitability effects we include star formation efficiency, stellar encounters, supernova explosions, and active galactic nuclei. We find the following to be disfavored in the multiverse scenario: flexible GUTs, pessimistic galactic disruption rates, some origin of life theories, and freeze-out dark matter with high energy baryogenesis. These predictions can be tested in future experiments to either confirm or rule out the multiverse.
#### Volcanic Satellites Tidally Venting Na, K, SO2 in Optical & Infrared Light

 - **Abstract**
 Recent infrared spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spurred analyses of common volcanic gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), alongside alkali metals sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) surrounding the hot Saturn WASP-39 b. We report more than an order-of-magnitude of variability in the density of neutral Na, K, and SO2 between ground-based measurements and JWST, at distinct epochs, hinting at exogenic physical processes similar to those sourcing Io's extended atmosphere and torus. Tidally-heated volcanic satellite simulations sputtering gas into a cloud or toroid orbiting the planet, are able to reproduce the probed line-of-sight column density variations. The estimated SO2 flux is consistent with tidal gravitation predictions, with a Na/SO2 ratio far smaller than Io's. Although stable satellite orbits at this system are known to be < 15.3 hours, several high-resolution alkali Doppler shift observations are required to constrain a putative orbit. Due to the Roche limit interior to the planetary photosphere at ~ 8 hours, atmosphere-exosphere interactions are expected to be especially important at this system.
#### Gamma radiation from cosmic rays escaping a young supernova remnant: The case of Cas A

 - **Abstract**
 The escape of accelerated particles from supernova remnants remains one of the central and yet least understood aspects of the origin of cosmic rays. Here we use the results of the recent LHAASO observation of gamma rays from a region of $\sim 2$ degrees around the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant to constrain the process of particle escape from this remnant. We dedicate special attention to discuss the impact of shock evolution and particle propagation in the near source region on the gamma ray emission. This is very important to assess the possibility that very high-energy protons may have been accelerated in past activity of Cas A. Given the core collapse nature of Cas A and its young age ($\sim 340$ years), the non detection of $\gtrsim 100$ TeV gamma rays from this remnant allows us to draw some conclusions on the role of supernova explosions for the origin of cosmic rays at the knee. In particular we calculate the spectrum of cosmic rays that may have escaped this remnant to make a clear distinction between the instantaneous maximum energy and the one that appears as a flux suppression in the time integrated spectrum from an individual supernova. LHAASO observation of the region around Cas A as well as gamma ray observations of the remnant itself confirm that this remnant is not operating as a PeVatron and that, although in the early stages the maximum energy may have reached $\sim$Peta-electronVolt, the number of such particles in the surroundings of Cas A is exceedingly small.
#### Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}_\odot$.
#### Formation of chromospheric Fe I lines in the near ultraviolet in 1D atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 In the near ultraviolet (NUV) part of the solar spectrum, there are several Fe I lines with very broad profiles, typical of chromospheric lines. These lines are largely unexplored due to the lack of high-resolution data in this region. This changed with the successful Sunrise III flight in 2024, when spectro-polarimetric data were recorded with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution covering a large variety of solar targets. The aim of this work is to investigate the formation of the lines and lay the groundwork for further studies. We compute the spectrum of the lines at 358.12 nm, 371.99 nm, 406.36 nm, and 407.17 nm emerging from the standard 1D FAL-atmospheres using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer code RH. We find that the lines are affected by overionization in the wings, but have line cores strongly affected by scattering. The line cores form well into the chromosphere in the tested atmosphere models except the colder FALX model where the line core forms in the temperature minimum (which lies at traditional chromospheric heights). In the presence of a vertical magnetic field, the Stokes $V$ signal is multi-lobed. The profile can be decomposed into two broad photospheric lobes and two sharper lobes forming in the flanks of the chromospheric line core. We have investigated the properties of four lines of Fe I that form in the lower chromosphere. The results provide a basic understanding of the formation of the lines, which will be useful for later analysis of formation in 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and an eventual investigation into their diagnostic potential.
#### Constraining Brown Dwarf Desert Formation Mechanisms Through Statistical Comparison of Observed and Simulated Orbital Distributions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of brown dwarf companions to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed "brown dwarf desert", the notable paucity of brown dwarf companions, at orbital separations between 0.1 and 5 AU. Using a sample of 108 confirmed brown dwarf companions from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with masses between 13-80 Jupiter masses and orbital semi-major axes between 0.1-5.0 AU, we employ Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical (KS) tests to compare observed orbital distributions with three proposed formation scenarios: (A) disk migration with stellar infall, (B) core accretion with mass-dependent survival probability, and (C) formation bias through dynamical migration. Our systematic grid-search analysis spans 27 parameter combinations for disk migration, 9 for core accretion, and 3 for formation bias models. The disk migration model provides the best statistical fit to observations (KS statistic = 0.100, p-value = 0.216), with optimal parameters {\mu}_rate = 0.5, {\sigma}_rate = 0.5, and t-myr = 0.5. The formation bias model achieves intermediate performance (KS = 0.173, p-value = 0.005) with optimal migration fraction p_move = 0.05, while the core accretion scenario shows the poorest fit (KS = 0.417, p-value = 3.5{\times}10^-17) despite its theoretical appeal. Our results suggest that brown dwarfs primarily form at wide separations and undergo limited inward migration, challenging scenarios that invoke in-situ formation through core accretion processes at close orbital separations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a systematic search for transiting short-period Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars (GEMS; $P < 10$ days, $R_p \gtrsim 8~R_\oplus$) within a distance-limited 100\,pc sample of 149,316 M-dwarfs using TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) data. This search led to the discovery of one new candidate GEM, following spectroscopic vetting of 12 additional candidates to eliminate astrophysical false positives and refine our occurrence rate estimates. We describe the development and application of the \texttt{TESS-miner} package and associated vetting procedures used in this analysis. To assess detection completeness, we conducted $\sim$ 72 million injection-recovery tests across $\sim$ 26,000 stars with an average of $\sim$3 sectors of data per star, subdivided into early-type (M0--M2.5), mid-type (M2.5--M4), and late-type (M4 or later) M-dwarfs. Our pipeline demonstrates high sensitivity across all M-dwarf subtypes within the injection bounds. We estimate the occurrence rates of short-period GEMS as a function of stellar mass, and combine our measured occurrence rates with those derived for FGK stars and fit an exponential trend with stellar mass, consistent with core-accretion theory predictions. We find GEMS occurrence rates of $0.067\% \pm 0.047\%$ for early-type M-dwarfs, $0.139\% \pm 0.069\%$ for mid-type, and $0.032\% \pm 0.032\%$ for late-type M-dwarfs, with a mean rate of $0.065^{+0.025}_{-0.027}\%$ across the full M-dwarf sample. We note that while our search spanned $1.0~\mathrm{days} < P < 10.0$ days, these occurrence rates were calculated using planets orbiting with $1.0~\mathrm{days} < P < 5.0$ days. This work lays the foundation for future occurrence rate investigations for GEMS.
#### Probing accretion and stellar properties in the Orion Nebula with VLT/X-Shooter

 - **Abstract**
 Multiple photometric studies have reported the presence of seemingly older accreting pre-main sequence stars (PMS) in optical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We investigate this phenomenon in the Orion Nebula, which harbors a subset of stars that show infrared excess detected by Spitzer and Halpha excess emission, yet display significantly older isochronal ages (>10 Myr) compared to the bulk population (~1-3 Myr) in the r, (r-i) CMD. We perform a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 40 Orion Nebula stars using VLT/X-Shooter, covering CMD-based isochronal ages from 1 to over 30 Myr. We derive extinction values, stellar properties, and accretion parameters by modeling the ultraviolet excess emission through a multicomponent fitting procedure. The sample spans spectral types from M4.5 up to K6, and masses in the range ~0.1-0.8 Msun. We demonstrate that, when extinction and, most importantly, accretion effects are accurately constrained, the stellar luminosity and effective temperature of the majority of the seemingly old stars become consistent with a younger population (~1-5 Myr). This is supported by strong lithium absorption, which corroborates their youth, and by the accretion-to-stellar luminosity ratios typical for young, accreting stars. Three of these sources, however, remain old even after our analysis, despite showing signatures consistent with ongoing accretion from a protoplanetary disc. More generally, our analysis indicates that excess continuum emission from accretion shocks affects the placement of PMS stars in the CMD, displacing sources towards bluer optical colours. This study highlights the critical role of accretion in shaping the stellar properties estimates (including age) derived from optical CMDs and emphasizes the need to carefully account for accretion effects when interpreting age distributions in star-forming regions.
