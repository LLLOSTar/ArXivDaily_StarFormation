#### How Does a Protostar Form by Magnetized Gravitational Collapse?

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation through the dynamical magnetized collapse remains an active area of astrophysical research. We carry out a comprehensive exploration on the magnetized gravitational collapse of a non-rotating self-gravitating initially spherically symmetric prestellar cloud core using two-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations incorporating ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation. Our study encompasses a broader range of equations of state (EOSs) in the form of $P(\rho) \propto \rho^{\Gamma}$, with the aim of constraining the choice of EOSs for allowing star formation. Our results reveal that the collapse with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than $4/3$, complemented by magnetized virial theorem, allows the dynamical contraction of the prestellar core to happen continuously where a central point mass forms and steadily builds up its mass from the infalling envelope, with a mass accretion rate of a scale of the order of $c_{\rm s}^3/G$. The choice of an isothermal EOS most naturally facilitates the collapse as a magnetic analog of the inside-out collapse. In addition to that, our study exhibits that the nonisothermal magnetized collapse models with a $\Gamma$ no stiffer than 4/3 qualitatively demonstrate similar infall features to those of an isothermal EOS. Furthermore, the collapse models with a $\Gamma$ stiffer than $4/3$ fail to ensure the sufficient cooling to allow the direct mass growth of the central point mass, thus delaying the infall. Our work can offer deeper insights in understanding the significance of EOSs on the magnetized gravitational collapse, enabling star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Massive contact binaries are both stellar merger and gravitational wave progenitors, but their evolution is still uncertain. An open problem in the population synthesis of massive contact binaries is the predicted mass ratio distribution. Current simulations evolve quickly to mass ratios close to unity, which is not supported by the sample of observed systems. It has been shown that modifying the near core mixing properties of massive stars can alter the evolution of contact binaries, but it has not been tested on a whole population. Aims. We implement a prescription of the convective core overshooting based on the molecular gradient. The goal of the implementation is to limit the rejuvenation efficiency of the accretor. We aim to investigate the effects of the reduced rejuvenation on the mass ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Methods. We calculate a grid of 4896 models with the binary-evolution code MESA with our convective overshoot formulation, and we compare the simulations with the known observations of massive contact binaries. Results. We find that by limiting the core rejuvenation through the convective core overshoot, the predicted mass-ratio distribution shifts significantly to values away from unity. This improves the theoretical predictions of the mass ratios of massive contact binaries. Conclusions. The core rejuvenation of the components in massive contact binaries is a key parameter for their predicted mass ratio distribution. Establishing the rejuvenation efficiency with the contact binary population should therefore be possible. The sample size and uncertainties associated to the characterization of contact binaries however prevents us from doing so, and other methods like asteroseismology can place constraints on the rejuvenation process.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and their associated planets originate from the same cloud of gas and dust, making a star's elemental composition a valuable indicator for indirectly studying planetary compositions. While the connection between a star's iron (Fe) abundance and the presence of giant exoplanets is established (e.g. Gonzalez 1997; Fischer & Valenti 2005), the relationship with small planets remains unclear. The elements Mg, Si, and Fe are important in forming small planets. Employing machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, trained on the abundances (e.g., the Hypatia Catalog, Hinkel et al. 2014) of known exoplanet-hosting stars (NASA Exoplanet Archive), allows us to determine significant "features" (abundances or molar ratios) that may indicate the presence of small planets. We test on three groups of exoplanets: (a) all small, R$_{P}$ $<$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, (b) sub-Neptunes, 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $<$ R$_{P}$ $<$ 3.5 $R_{\oplus}$, and (c) super-Earths, 1.0 $R_{\oplus}$ $<$ R$_{P}$ $<$ 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$ -- each subdivided into 7 ensembles to test different combinations of features. We created a list of stars with $\geq90\%$ probability of hosting small planets across all ensembles and experiments ("overlap stars"). We found abundance trends for stars hosting small planets, possibly indicating star-planet chemical interplay during formation. We also found that Na and V are key features regardless of planetary radii. We expect our results to underscore the importance of elements in exoplanet formation and machine learning's role in target selection for future NASA missions: e.g., the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) -- all of which are aimed at small planet detection.
#### Where do High-Velocity Dark Matter Particles come from in the Milky Way?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17565

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity particles ( $v>v_\mathrm{esc}$) in the Milky Way are rare but nonetheless important to characterize due to their impact on dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments. We select halos similar in mass to the Milky Way in a large-volume dark matter simulation and measure the incidence of high-velocity particles, finding that an average fraction $\sim 1.3\times 10^{-5}$ of the DM particles have $\Delta v > 600$ km/s within 5-11 kpc of the halo centers. However, some systems have dramatically higher fractions. Milky Way-like systems with high-speed satellites can have high-velocity DM fractions of order $\sim 100\times$ higher than average. The environment also affects high-velocity DM fractions; massive nearby halos ( $>10^{13} M_{\odot}$) can boost high-velocity DM density by $\sim 10\times$, although there is little effect for nearby Andromeda-like systems. We confirm previous predictions from zoom-in simulations that the high-velocity particles in the Milky Way with heliocentric speeds $>700$ km/s primarily originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and provide a table of expected high-velocity DM densities at different heliocentric velocity thresholds.
#### Effects of spacetime geometry on neutrino oscillation inside a Core-Collapse Supernova

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17570

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are excellent probes of the inner structures of supernovas. However, an understanding of their dynamics remains incomplete, which is crucial for properly interpreting the detector data. The huge matter density inside a core-collapse supernova affects the self-coupling of the neutrinos through a geometrical four-fermion interaction induced by spacetime torsion generated by the fermions themselves. For normal mass hierarchy, the effect is negligible; for inverted mass hierarchy however, we find that the gravitational coupling can significantly alter the flavor dynamics. The possibility of constraining the said interactions through the relative abundance of different flavors of the neutrinos is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The "super-puffs" are a population of planets that have masses comparable to that of Neptune but radii similar to Jupiter, leading to extremely low bulk densities ($\rho_p \lesssim 0.2\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) that are not easily explained by standard core accretion models. Interestingly, several of these super-puffs are found in orbits significantly misaligned with their host stars' spin axes, indicating past dynamical excitation that may be connected to their low densities. Here, we present new Magellan/PFS RV measurements of WASP-193, a late F star hosting one of the least dense transiting planets known to date ($M_p = 0.112^{+0.029}_{-0.034}\,M_J$, $R_p = 1.319^{+0.056}_{-0.048}\,R_J$, $\rho_p = 0.060\pm0.019\,\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). We refine the bulk properties of WASP-193 b and use interior structure models to determine that the planet can be explained if it consists of roughly equal amounts of metals and H/He, with a metal fraction of $Z = 0.42$. The planet is likely substantially re-inflated due to its host star's evolution, and expected to be actively undergoing mass loss. We also measure the projected stellar obliquity using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, finding that WASP-193 b is on an orbit well-aligned with the stellar equator, with $\lambda = 17^{+17}_{-16}$ degrees. WASP-193 b is the first Jupiter-sized super-puff on a relatively well-aligned orbit, suggesting a diversity of formation pathways for this population of planets.
#### Relationship between the $γ-$ray variability and the pc-scale jet in the blazar 3C 454.3

 - **Abstract**
 3C 454.3 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) known for its high variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, showing structural and flux variability in its pc-scale jet, and correlated variability among frequency bands. This study aims to identify the structure, dynamics, and radiative processes common to the innermost regions of the blazar 3C 454.3. We investigate whether any jet component can be associated with $\gamma-$ray emission and variability. We analyze the relationship between the variable $\gamma-$ray emission and pc-scale jet properties in 3C 454.3 by combining $\gamma-$ray data spanning twelve years with contemporaneous VLBA multi-epoch images at 15 and 43 GHz. Spearman rank correlation tests are conducted to determine if the flux variability of any jet component is associated with $\gamma-$ray variability. Core emission at 43 and 15 GHz strongly correlates with $\gamma-$ray emission. The 43 GHz core (Q0) contributes around 37$\%$ of the observed $\gamma-$ray variability, while the 15 GHz core (K0) accounts for 30$\%$. A quasi-stationary component at 43 GHz, at a projected distance of 4.6 pc, correlates with the $\gamma-$ray flux, accounting for 20$\%$ of its emission between 2016 and 2021. We found a mobile component (Q3 between 2010.18 and 2011.16) at 43 GHz with a projected distance between 0.8 and 2.3 pc and apparent velocity of $\beta_{app} = 9.9 \pm 1.1$ c, accounting for approximately 28% of the $\gamma-$ray emission. The observed simultaneous variability in emission regions beyond the central parsec strongly suggests synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) as the primary mechanism for $\gamma-$ray production in these regions. Our findings demonstrate the existence of multiple $\gamma-$ray emission regions within the blazar jet but also suggest that some of these regions are non-stationary over time.

 - **Abstract**
 We combined Gaia DR3 and TESS photometric light curves to estimate the internal physical properties of 2,497 gravity-mode pulsators. We relied on asteroseismic properties of Kepler $\gamma\,$Dor and SPB stars to derive the near-core rotation frequency, $f_{\rm rot}$, of the Gaia-discovered pulsators from their dominant prograde dipole gravito-inertial pulsation mode. We offer a recipe based on linear regression to deduce $f_{\rm rot}$ from the dominant gravito-inertial mode frequency. It is applicable to prograde dipole modes with an amplitude above 4mmag and occurring in the sub-inertial regime. By applying it to the 2,497 pulsators, we have increased the sample of intermediate-mass dwarfs with such an asteroseismic observable by a factor of 4. We used the estimate of $f_{\rm rot}$ to deduce spin parameters between 2 and 6, while the sample's near-core rotation rates range from 0.7% to 25% of the critical Keplerian rate. We used $f_{\rm rot}$, along with the Gaia effective temperature and luminosity to deduce the (convective core) mass, radius, and evolutionary stage from grid modelling based on rotating stellar models. We derived a decline of $f_{\rm rot}$ with a factor of 2 during the main-sequence evolution for this population of field stars, which covers a mass range from 1.3M$_\odot$ to 7M$_\odot$. We found observational evidence for an increase in the radial order of excited gravity modes as the stars evolve. For 307 pulsators, we derived an upper limit of the radial differential rotation between the convective core boundary and the surface from Gaia's vbroad measurement and found values up to 5.4. Our recipe for the near-core rotation frequency from the dominant gravito-inertial mode detected in the independent Gaia and TESS light curves is easy to use, facilitates applications to large samples, and allows to map their angular momentum and evolutionary stage in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia DR3, released in June 2022, included low-resolution XP spectra that have been used for the classification of various types of emission-line objects through machine-learning techniques. The Gaia Extended Stellar Parametrizer for Emission-Line Stars (ESP-ELS) algorithm identified 565 sources as potential Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Over half of them were already known as WR stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. This study aimed to utilize Gaia DR3 data to identify new Galactic WR stars. We extracted all sources classified as WC or WN type stars by the ESP-ELS algorithm from the Gaia catalog. By applying judicious 2MASS color selection criteria, leveraging Gaia H$\alpha$ measurements, and filtering out objects already cataloged in various databases, we selected 37 bright candidates ($G \leq $ 16 mag) and 22 faint candidates ($G > $ 16 mag). Spectroscopic follow-up observations of these candidates were conducted using the 2SPOT facilities in Chile and France, as well as 1-m C2PU's Epsilon telescope at the Calern Observatory. This paper focuses on the brighter sample. Among the 37 targets, we confirmed 17 and 16 new Galactic WC and WN type WR stars, respectively. Three of them were recently reported as new WR stars in an independent study. The Gaia mission provides a valuable resource for uncovering WR stars missed in earlier surveys. While this work concentrated on a relatively small starting sample provided by the ESP-ELS algorithm, our findings highlight the potential for refining selection criteria to identify additional candidates not included in the outputs of the algorithm. Furthermore, the observation program underscores the utility of small telescopes in acquiring initial spectral data for sources with magnitudes up to $G \sim 16$ mag.

 - **Abstract**
 The light curves of old G-dwarfs obtained in the visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges are highly irregular. This significantly complicates the detectability of the rotation periods of stars similar to the Sun in large photometric surveys, such as Kepler and TESS. In this study, we show that light curves collected in the ultraviolet wavelength range are much more suitable for measuring rotation periods. Motivated by the observation that the Sun's rotational period is clearly discernible in the UV part of the spectrum, we study the wavelength dependence of the rotational period detectability. We employ the Spectral and Total Solar Irradiance Reconstructions model, SATIRE-S, to characterize the detectability of the solar rotation period across various wavelengths using the autocorrelation technique. We find that at wavelengths above 400 nm, the probability of detecting the rotation period of the Sun observed at a random phase of its activity cycle is approximately 20\%. The probability increases to 80\% at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. These findings underscore the importance of ultraviolet stellar photometry.
#### Erosion of a dense molecular core by a strong outflow from a massive protostar

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 3 observations of N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) and CH$_3$CN (5-4), as well as Band 7 observations of the H$_2$CO molecular line emissions from the protostellar system GGD 27-MM2(E). Through position-velocity diagrams along and across the outflow axis, we study the kinematics and structure of the outflow. We also fit extracted spectra of the CH$_3$CN emission to obtain the physical conditions of the gas. We use the results to discuss the impact of the outflow on its surroundings. We find that N$_2$H$^+$ emission traces a dense molecular cloud surrounding GGD 27-MM2(E). We estimate that the mass of this cloud is $\sim$13.3-26.5 M$_\odot$. The molecular cloud contains an internal cavity aligned with the H$_2$CO-traced molecular outflow. The outflow, also traced by $\mathrm{CH_3 CN}$, shows evidence of a collision with a molecular core (MC), as indicated by the distinctive increases in the distinct physical properties of the gas such as excitation temperature, column density, line width, and velocity. This collision results in an X-shape structure in the northern part of the outflow around the position of the MC, which produces spray-shocked material downstream in the north of MC as observed in position-velocity diagrams both along and across of the outflow axis. The outflow has a mass of 1.7-2.1 M$_\odot$, a momentum of 7.8-10.1 M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$, a kinetic energy of 5.0-6.6$\times 10^{44}$ erg, and a mass loss rate of 4.9--6.0$\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The molecular outflow from GGD 27-MM2(E) significantly perturbs and erodes its parent cloud, compressing the gas of sources such as MC and ALMA 12. The feedback from this powerful protostellar outflow contributes to maintain the turbulence in the surrounding area.
#### Radial dependence of ion fluences in the 2023 July 17 SEP event from Parker Solar Probe to STEREO and ACE

 - **Abstract**
 In the latter moments of 17 July 2023, the solar active region 13363, near the southwestern face of the Sun, was undergoing considerable evolution, which resulted in a significant solar energetic particle (SEP) event measured by Parker Solar Probe's Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) and near-Earth spacecraft. Remote observations from GOES and CHASE captured two M5.0+ solar flares that peaked at 23:34 and 00:06 UT from the source region. In tandem, STEREO COR2 first recorded a small, narrow coronal mass ejection (CME) emerging at 22:54 UT and then saw a major halo CME emerge at 23:43 UT with a bright, rapidly expanding core and CME-driven magnetic shock with an estimated speed of $\sim$1400 $kms^{-1}$. Parker Solar Probe was positioned at 0.65 au, near-perfectly on the nominal Parker spiral magnetic field line which connected Earth and the active region for a 537 $kms^{-1}$ ambient solar wind speed at L1. This fortuitous alignment provided the opportunity to examine how the SEP velocity dispersion, energy spectra, elemental composition, and fluence varied from 0.65 to 1 au along a shared magnetic connection to the Sun. We find a strong radial gradient, which is best characterized for H and He as $r^{-4.0}$ and most surprisingly is stronger for O and Fe which is better described by $r^{-5.7}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The aromatic molecule benzene is considered the essential building block for larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in space. Despite benzene's importance in the formation of PAHs, the formation mechanisms of interstellar benzene are not well understood. A single ion-molecule reaction sequence is considered when modeling the formation of benzene in the interstellar medium, beginning with the protonation of acetylene. Although this process has been used to model the initial steps for formation of PAHs, it has not been experimentally measured. To explore this reaction mechanism, we have carried out the first experimental study of sequential ion-molecule reactions beginning with protonation of acetylene at single-collision conditions. Surprisingly, we find that the reaction sequence does not result in benzene and instead terminates at C6H5+, which is unreactive toward both acetylene and hydrogen. This result disproves the previously proposed mechanism for interstellar benzene formation, critically altering our understanding of interstellar PAH formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 In previous works, we have shown that stars in the Orion and the Lagoon Nebula Clusters, and simulations of collapsing clouds, exhibit constant velocity dispersion as a function of mass, a result described by Lynden-Bell 50 years ago as an effect of a violent relaxation mechanism. In contrast, numerical simulations of turbulent clouds show that newborn massive stars experience stronger dynamical heating than low-mass stars. We analyzed turbulent numerical simulations and found that this effect arises from the fact that, in clouds that are globally turbulence-supported against collapse, massive stars are formed within more massive and denser clumps and in more crowded environments compared to low-mass stars. This allows them to accrete more mass and interact with other stars simultaneously. As they become more massive, their orbits tighten, increasing their velocity dispersion. In contrast, low-mass stars are formed in the periphery of such cores, more separated, and at lower densities. Thus, their velocity dispersion remains lower because they do not accrete as vigorously as massive stars and tend to be more isolated. We call this mechanism "accretion-induced orbital tightening." Our results and previous findings about violent relaxation provide a key observational diagnostic of how to distinguish the dynamic state of star-forming molecular clouds through the kinematics of their newborn stars.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the dramatic improvement in the spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres demands a corresponding leap forward in our ability to analyze them: atmospheric retrievals need to be performed on thousands of spectra, applying to each large ensembles of models (that explore atmospheric chemistry, thermal profiles and cloud models) to identify the best one(s). In this limit, traditional Bayesian inference methods such as nested sampling become prohibitively expensive. We introduce FASTER (Fast Amortized Simulation-based Transiting Exoplanet Retrieval), a neural-network based method for performing atmospheric retrieval and Bayesian model comparison at a fraction of the computational cost of classical techniques. We demonstrate that the marginal posterior distributions of all parameters within a model as well as the posterior probabilities of the models we consider match those computed using nested sampling both on mock spectra, and for the real NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of WASP-39b. The true power of the FASTER framework comes from its amortized nature, which allows the trained networks to perform practically instantaneous Bayesian inference and model comparison over ensembles of spectra -- real or simulated -- at minimal additional computational cost. This offers valuable insight into the expected results of model comparison (e.g., distinguishing cloudy from cloud-free and isothermal from non-isothermal models), as well as their dependence on the underlying parameters, which is computationally unfeasible with nested sampling. This approach will constitute as large a leap in spectral analysis as the original retrieval methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo have proven to be.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysing extended emission in photometric observations of star-forming regions requires maps free from compact foreground, embedded, and background sources, which can interfere with various techniques used to characterise the interstellar medium. Within the framework of the NEMESIS project, we apply machine learning techniques to improve our understanding of the star formation timescales, which involves the unbiased analysis of the extended emission in these regions. We present a deep learning-based method for separating the signals of compact sources and extended emission in photometric observations made by the Herschel Space Observatory, facilitating the analysis of extended emission and improving the photometry of compact sources. Central to our approach is a modified U-Net architecture with partial convolutional layers. This method enables effective source removal and background estimation across various flux densities, using a series of partial convolutional layers, batch normalisation, and ReLU activation layers within blocks. Our training process utilised simulated sources injected into Herschel images, with controlled flux densities against known backgrounds. A dynamic, signal-to-noise ratio-based adaptive masking system was implemented to assess how prominently a compact source stands out from the surrounding background. The results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the photometric accuracy in the presence of highly fluctuating backgrounds. Moreover, the approach can preserve all characteristics of the images, including the noise properties. The presented approach allows users to analyse extended emission without the interference of disturbing point sources or perform more precise photometry of sources located in complex environments. We also provide a Python tool with tutorials and examples to help the community effectively utilise this method.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun and are considered the main driver of adverse space weather events. Hence, undrstanding its formation process, particularly the magnetic topology, is critical for accurate space weather prediction. Here, based on imaging observations and three-dimensional (3D) data-constrained thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation in spherical coordinates, we exhibit the birth of a CME with intricate magnetic structure from multiple active regions (ARs) due to 3D magnetic reconnection. It is observed as a coronal jet between active regions, accompanied by the back-flowing of filament materials along the jet spine after the passage of the eruptive filament. This jet connects two dimming regions within different active regions. This is an observational proxy of 3D magnetic reconnection between the CME flux rope and the null-point magnetic field lines crossing active regions. Hereafter, the thermodynamic data-constrained MHD simulation successfully reproduces the observed jet and the reconnection process that flux ropes partake in, leading to a CME flux rope with a complex magnetic structure distinct from its progenitor. The generality of this scenario is then validated by data-inspired MHD simulations in a simple multipolar magnetic configuration. This work demonstrates the role of multiple active regions in forming CMEs with intricate magnetic structures. On the one hand, a non-coherent flux rope where not all twisted magnetic field lines wind around one common axis is naturally formed. On the other hand, our findings suggest that the topology of a real CME flux rope may not be solely determined by a single active region, particularly during periods of solar maximum.

 - **Abstract**
 Using results of numerical simulations and astrophysical observations (mainly in the WMAP and Planck frequency bands) it is shown that Galactic foreground emission becomes more sensitive to the mean magnetic field with the frequency, that results in the appearance of two levels of its randomization due to chaotic/turbulent dynamics of magnetized interstellar medium dominated by the magnetic helicity. The galactic foreground emission is more randomized at higher frequencies. The Galactic synchrotron and polarized dust emissions have been studied in detail. It is shown that the magnetic field imposes its level of randomization on the synchrotron and dust emission. The main method for the theoretical consideration used in this study is the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology in the frames of distributed chaos notion. Despite the vast differences in the values of physical parameters and spatio-temporal scales between the numerical simulations and the astrophysical observations, there is a quantitative agreement between the results of the astrophysical observations and the numerical simulations in the frames of the distributed chaos notion.
