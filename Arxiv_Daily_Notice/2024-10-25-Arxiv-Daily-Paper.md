#### POSEIDON: A Multidimensional Atmospheric Retrieval Code for Exoplanet Spectra
 - **Authors:** Ryan J. MacDonald

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal the chemical composition, temperature, cloud properties, and (potentially) the habitability of these distant worlds. The inference of such properties is generally enabled by Bayesian atmospheric retrieval algorithms. However, until recently, many retrieval codes have not been publicly available. Here, we describe the open source release of the POSEIDON exoplanet radiative transfer and retrieval code. POSEIDON is a Python package for the 1D, 2D, or 3D modelling and analysis of exoplanet spectra, which is frequently used to interpret Hubble and JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheres. We provide extensive tutorials on both forward modelling and retrievals in POSEIDON's online documentation, which we hope will serve as a helpful resource for the exoplanet atmosphere community.
#### The origin and evolution of the [CII]-deficit in HII regions and star-forming molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse synthetic maps of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and FIR continuum of simulated molecular clouds (MCs) within the SILCC-Zoom project to study the origin of the [CII]-deficit, i.e., the drop of the [CII]/FIR intensity ratio. All simulations include stellar radiative feedback and account for further ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ inside HII regions. For individual HII regions, $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ is initially high in the vicinity of young stars, and then moderately decreases as the gas is compressed into shells. In contrast, $I_\mathrm{CII}$ drops strongly over time, to which the second ionisation of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ contributes. This leads to a strong drop of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}/I_\mathrm{FIR}$ inside HII regions, decreasing from 10$^{-3}$-10$^{-2}$ at scales above 10 pc to 10$^{-6}$-10$^{-4}$ at scales below 2pc. However, projection effects can affect the radial profile of $I_\mathrm{[CII]}$ and $I_\mathrm{FIR}$ and create apparent HII regions without any stars. On MC scales, $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ decreases from values $\gtrsim$10$^{-2}$ in MCs without star formation to values around $\sim10^{-3}$ in MCs with star formation. We attribute this and the origin of the [CII]-deficit to two main contributors: (i) the saturation of the [CII] line and (ii) the conversion of C$^+$ into C$^{2+}$ by stellar radiation. The drop of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ can be divided into two phases: (i) early on, the saturation of [CII] and the further ionisation of C$^+$ limit the increase of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}$, while $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ increases rapidly, leading to the initial decline of $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$. (ii) In more evolved HII regions, $L_\mathrm{CII}$ stagnates and partially even drops due to the aforementioned reasons. $L_\mathrm{FIR}$ stagnates as the gas gets pushed into the cooler shells keeping $L_\mathrm{[CII]}/L_\mathrm{FIR}$ at low values of $\sim10^{-3}$.
#### Exploring the physical origins of halo assembly bias from early times

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale linear halo bias encodes the relation between the clustering of dark-matter (DM) halos and that of the underlying matter density field. Although the primary dependence of bias on halo mass is well understood in the context of structure formation, the physical origins of the multiple additional relations at fixed halo mass, commonly known as secondary halo bias, have not been fully elucidated. Of particular relevance is the secondary dependence on halo assembly history, known as halo assembly bias. Our goal is to determine whether the properties of the initial regions from which $z=0$ halos originate produce any secondary bias at $z=0$. By analyzing these initial dependencies in connection with halo assembly bias, we intend to provide insight on the physical origins of the effect. To this end, we select halos at $z=0$ in the IllustrisTNG DM-only simulation and trace back the positions and velocities of their DM particles to $z=12$. The resulting initial regions are characterized according to several shape-related and kinematic properties. The secondary bias signal produced by these properties at $z=0$ is measured using an object-by-object bias estimator, which offers significant analytical advantages. We show that, when split by the properties of their initial DM clouds, $z=0$ halos display significant secondary bias, clearly exceeding the amplitude of the well-known halo assembly bias signal produced by concentration and age. The maximum bias segregation is measured for cloud velocity dispersion and radial velocity, followed by cloud concentration, sphericity, ellipticity and triaxiality. We further show that both velocity dispersion and radial velocity are also the properties of the initial clouds that most strongly correlate with halo age and concentration at fixed halo mass. Our results highlight the importance of linear effects in shaping halo assembly bias.
#### Narrow [O III] emission lines as a potential proxy for the evolutionary stage of quasars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18401

 - **Abstract**
 Radio spectral shape of quasars can provide insight into the ages of quasars. We have compiled data for 1804 quasars with $z\lesssim1$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, these quasars were also mapped by the Low-Frequency Array at 144 MHz and the Very Large Array Sky Survey at 3000 MHz. The radio spectral index, designated as $\alpha^{\rm 144}_{\rm 3000}$ (with $S(\nu)\propto\nu^\alpha$), is analyzed between 144 MHz and 3000 MHz as a proxy for the ages of quasars. We measure the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line in the SDSS spectra. A strong correlation was found between the equivalent width of the core component of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line and $\alpha^{\rm 144}_{\rm 3000}$. This relationship suggests that the core component of the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission line could potentially serve as a surrogate for the evolutionary stage of a quasar. The quasars at an early stage of evolutions tend to show weaker [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission, while older quasars exhibit stronger [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The existing flare prediction primarily relies on photospheric magnetic field parameters from the entire active region (AR), such as Space-Weather HMI Activity Region Patches (SHARP) parameters. However, these parameters may not capture the details the AR evolution preceding flares. The magnetic structure within the core area of an AR is essential for predicting large solar flares. This paper utilizes the area of high photospheric free energy density (HED region) as a proxy for the AR core region. We construct two datasets: SHARP and HED datasets. The ARs contained in both datasets are identical. Furthermore, the start and end times for the same AR in both datasets are identical. We develop six models for 24-hour solar flare forecasting, utilizing SHARP and HED datasets. We then compare their categorical and probabilistic forecasting performance. Additionally, we conduct an analysis of parameter importance. The main results are as follows: (1) Among the six solar flare prediction models, the models using HED parameters outperform those using SHARP parameters in both categorical and probabilistic prediction, indicating the important role of the HED region in the flare initiation process. (2) The Transformer flare prediction model stands out significantly in True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Brier Skill Score (BSS), surpassing the other models. (3) In parameter importance analysis, the total photospheric free magnetic energy density ($\mathrm {E_{free}}$) within the HED parameters excels in both categorical and probabilistic forecasting. Similarly, among the SHARP parameters, the R_VALUE stands out as the most effective parameter for both categorical and probabilistic forecasting.
#### XMM-Newton observations of the peculiar Be X-ray binary A0538-66

 - **Abstract**
 A0538-66 is a neutron star/Be X-ray binary located in the Large Magellanic Cloud and, since its discovery in the seventies, it showed a peculiar behavior which makes it a unique object in the high-mass X-ray binaries scene: the extremely eccentric orbit (e=0.72), the short spin period of the neutron star (P=69 ms), the episodes of super-Eddington accretion. These characteristics contribute to a remarkable bursting activity that lasts from minutes to hours and increases the flux by a factor 10^3-10^4. In 2018, A0538-66 was observed by XMM-Newton in a particularly active state, characterized by a forest of short bursts lasting 0.7-50 seconds each. In this contribution we present a reanalysis of these observations. The timing analysis allowed us to distinguish between the epochs of direct accretion and propeller state, that do not correlate with the orbital position of the neutron star. The spectral analysis revealed that during the accretion regime three components (a soft one, a hard one, and a ~6.4-keV emission line) equally contribute to the overall emission, while the propeller regime is characterized by a single soft component. We discuss these findings in the context of spherical and disk accretion regimes, highlighting the similarities and the differences with other X-ray binary systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) allow for the possibility of precise characterization of its stellar components. They offer a unique opportunity to derive their physical parameters in a near-model-independent way for a number of systems consisting of late-type giant stars. Here we aim to expand the sample of low-metallicity late-type giant stars with precise parameters determined. We aim to determine the fundamental parameters like the mass, radius, or effective temperature for three long-period late-type eclipsing binaries from the Large Magellanic Cloud: OGLE-LMC-ECL-25304, OGLE-LMC-ECL-28283, and OGLE-IV LMC554.19.81. Subsequently we aim to determine the evolutionary stages of the this http URL fit the light curves from the OGLE project and radial velocity curves from high resolution spectrographs using the Wilson-Devinney code. The spectral analysis was performed with the GSSP code and resulted in the determination of atmospheric parameters such as effective temperatures and metallicities. We used isochrones provided by the MIST models based on the MESA code to derive evolutionary status of the stars. We present the first analysis of three DEBs composed of similar He-burning late-type stars passing through the blue loop. Estimated masses for OGLE-LMC-ECL-29293 (G4III + G4III) are $M_1=2.898\pm0.031$ and $M_2=3.153\pm0.038$ $M_\odot$, stellar radii are $R_1=19.43\pm0.31$ and $R_2=19.30\pm0.31$ $R_\odot$. OGLE-LMC-ECL-25304 (G4III + G5III) has stellar masses of $M_1=3.267\pm0.028$ and $M_2=3.229\pm0.029$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_1=23.62\pm0.42$ and $R_2=25.10\pm0.43$ $R_\odot$. OGLE-IV LMC554.19.81 (G2III + G2III) have masses of $M_1=3.165\pm0.020$ and $M_2=3.184\pm0.020$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_1=18.86\pm0.26$ and $R_2=19.64\pm0.26$ $R_\odot$. All masses were determined with a precision better than 2\% and radii better than 1.5\%. The ages of the stars are in the range of 270-341 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) is among the most suitable candidates to replace WIMPs and to resolve the puzzling mystery of dark matter. A galactic dark matter halo made of these ultralight bosonic particles leads to the formation of a solitonic core surrounded by quantum interference patterns that, on average, reproduce a Navarro-Frenk-White-like mass density profile in the outskirts of the halo. The structure of such a core is determined once the boson mass and the total mass of the halo are set. We investigated the capability of future astrometric Theia-like missions to detect the properties of such a halo within the FDM model, namely the boson mass and the core radius. To this aim, we built mock catalogs containing three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars within a target dwarf galaxy. We exploited these catalogs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and found that measuring the proper motion of at least 2000 stars within the target galaxy, with uncertainty $\sigma_v \leq 3$ km/s on the velocity components, will constrain the boson mass and the core radius with 3\% accuracy. Furthermore, the transition between the solitonic core and the outermost NFW-like density profile could be detected with an uncertainty of 7\%. Such results would not only help to confirm the existence of FDM, but they would also be useful for alleviating the current tension between galactic and cosmological estimations of the boson mass, or demonstrating the need for multiple particles with a broad mass spectrum as naturally arise String Axiverse.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Transmission spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding exoplanet atmospheres. At optical wavelengths, it makes it possible to infer the composition and the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. However, unocculted stellar activity can result in contamination of atmospheric transmission spectra by introducing spurious slopes and molecular signals. Aims: We aim to characterise the atmosphere of the transiting exoplanet WASP-69b, a hot Jupiter orbiting an active K star, and characterise the host star's activity levels. Methods: We obtained three nights of spectrophotometric data with the FORS2 instrument on the VLT, covering a wavelength range of 340-1100 nm. We performed retrievals on the full spectrum with combined stellar activity and planet atmosphere models. Results: We directly detect a facula in the form of a hot spot crossing event in one of the transits and indirectly detect unocculted faculae through an apparently decreasing radius towards the blue end of the transmission spectrum. We determine a facula temperature of $\Delta T=+644^{+427}_{-263}$ K for the former and a stellar coverage fraction of around 30% with a temperature of $\Delta T=+231\pm72$ K for the latter. The planetary atmosphere is best fit with a high-altitude cloud deck at 1.4 mbar that mutes atomic and molecular features. We find indications of water and ammonia with $log(H_2O)=-2.01^{+0.54}_{-0.86}$ and $log(NH_3)=-3.4^{+0.96}_{-5.20} respectively and place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on TiO ($10^{-7.65}$) and K ($10^{-7}$). Conclusions. The simultaneous multi-wavelength observations allow us to break the size-contrast degeneracy for facula-crossings, meaning we can obtain temperatures for both the directly and indirectly detected faculae, which are consistent with each other.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of massive binary systems has steadily progressed over the past decades, with increasing focus on their evolution, interactions and mergers, driven by improvements in computational modelling and observational techniques. In particular, when a binary system involves a massive giant and a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) that go through common envelope evolution (CEE), it might results in the merger of the compact object with the core of its giant companion, giving rise to various high energy astrophysical phenomena. We review the different evolutionary channels that lead to compact objects-core mergers, key physical processes with emphasis on the role of accretion physics, feasibility of r-process nucleosynthesis, expected observable electromagnetic, neutrinos and gravitational-waves (GWs) signatures, as well as potential correlation with detected core collapse supernovae (CCSNe), luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and low luminosity long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). After presenting our current understanding of these mergers, we conclude discussing prospects for future advancements.
#### A Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in 30 Dor as seen by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are responsible for strong mid-IR emission features near star-forming regions. It is well known that low-metallicity environments exhibit weaker PAH emission, but it is not clear how the metallicity affects the properties of the emitting PAH population. We present a detailed study of the PAH emission in the low-metallicity regime represented by 30 Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and we compare it to the PAH emission in the Orion Bar to investigate the characteristics of the PAH population and how the environments affects the resulting IR emission. We analyze JWST observations of 30 Dor that include imaging (NIRCam, MIRI) and spectroscopy (NIRSpec/IFU, MIRI/MRS). We extracted NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS spectra from 18 apertures that cover the morphological structures of 30 Dor. We characterize the profiles and relative intensities of PAH emission in these apertures. The detailed profiles of the PAH emission bands in 30 Dor are all very similar, and compare well to those from one of the dissociation fronts (DF2) in the Orion Bar. The relative band ratios on the other hand show a much larger range than in the Orion Bar. The PAH emission in 30 Dor originates from a population with a higher ionization fraction than in the Orion Bar, and a size distribution that has more smaller PAHs. Since smaller PAHs typically photo-fragment before larger PAHs, our findings support the hypothesis that the lower PAH emission for lower metallicities is the result of inhibition of growth toward larger PAHs rather than photo-fragmentation.
#### Twins in Diversity: Understanding circumstellar disk evolution in the twin clusters of W5 complex

 - **Abstract**
 Young star-forming regions in massive environments are ideal test beds to study the influence of surroundings on the evolution of disks around low-mass stars. We explore two distant young clusters, IC 1848-East and West located in the massive W5 complex. These clusters are unique due to their similar (distance, age, and extinction) yet distinct (stellar density and FUV radiation fields) physical properties. We use deep multi-band photometry in optical, near-IR, and mid-IR wavelengths complete down to the substellar limit in at least five bands. We trace the spectral energy distribution of the sources to identify the young pre-main sequence members in the region and derive their physical parameters. The disk fraction for the East and West clusters down to 0.1 M$_\odot$ was found to be $\sim$27$\pm$2% (N$_{disk}$=184, N$_{diskless}$=492) and $\sim$17$\pm$1% (N$_{disk}$=173, N$_{diskless}$=814), respectively. While no spatial variation in the disk fraction is observed, these values are lower than those in other nearby young clusters. Investigating the cause of this decrease, we find a correlation with the intense feedback from massive stars throughout the cluster area. We also identified the disk sources undergoing accretion and observed the mass accretion rates to exhibit a positive linear relationship with the stellar host mass and an inverse relationship with stellar age. Our findings suggest that the environment significantly influences the dissipation of disks in both clusters. These distant clusters, characterized by their unique attributes, can serve as templates for future studies in outer galaxy regions, offering insights into the influence of feedback mechanisms on star and planetary formation.
#### PRODIGE -- envelope to disk with NOEMA. IV. An infalling gas bridge surrounding two Class 0/I systems in L1448N

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.

 - **Abstract**
 This chapter provides an overview of the basic concepts foundational to atmospheric physics and chemistry. We discuss the retention of atmospheres against thermal evaporation and the global energy balance of planets. We present simple derivations of the vertical profile of an atmosphere, which may be shaped by convective and radiative transport. We then briefly touch upon the three-dimensional atmospheric structure, as shaped by circulation patterns. We describe how the abundances of chemical species in the atmosphere are determined, starting with the assumption of chemical equilibrium and then expanding to various disequilibrium effects. We introduce the particles that can be important components of atmospheres (clouds and hazes) and sketch out some of their complexity. Finally, we review some of the differences between atmospheres of terrestrial and gaseous worlds.
