 - **Abstract**
 The third Gaia Data Release has provided the astronomical community with astrometric data of more than 1.8 billion sources, and low resolution spectra for 220 million. Such a large amount of data is difficult to handle by means of visual inspection. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of the Gaia white dwarf population up to 500 pc from the Sun based on artificial intelligence algorithms to classify the sample into their main spectral types and subtypes. In order to classify the sample, which consists of 78 920 white dwarfs with available Gaia spectra, we have applied a Random Forest algorithm to the Gaia spectral coefficients. We used the Montreal White Dwarf Database of already labeled objects as our training sample. The classified sample is compared with other already published catalogs and with our own higher resolution Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra, enabling the construction of a golden sample of well-classified objects. The Random Forest spectral classification of the 500-pc white dwarf population achieves an excellent global accuracy of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.88 for the DA versus non-DA classification. In addition, we obtain a very high accuracy of 0.76 and a global F1-score of 0.62 for the non-DA subtype classification. In particular, our classification shows an excellent recall for DAs, DBs and DCs and a very good precision for DQs, DZs and DOs. The use of machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, has enabled us to spectrally classify 78,920 white dwarfs with reasonable accuracy. Having an estimate of the spectral type for the vast majority of white dwarfs up to 500 pc provides the possibility of making better estimates of cooling ages, star formation rates, and stellar evolution processes, among other fundamental aspects for the study of the white dwarf population.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are typically thought to result from the collapse of massive stars. Nonetheless, recent observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 211211A and 230307A, coupled with the low-redshift excess of LGRB event rates relative to star formation rates, present significant challenges to the prevailing model. We reexamine the selection criteria for higher redshift complete GRB samples and identify 280 Swift GRBs with peak flux over $2.6 ph cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. Assuming all LGRBs with $z \geq 2$ originate from collapsars, we construct the GRB luminosity functions(LFs) in three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results indicate that a strong redshift evolution in luminosity $\delta = 1.87^{+0.27}_{-0.31}$ or in density $\delta = 1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ is necessary. The luminosity/density evolution model predicts 72.67/57.28 collapsar GRBs at $z < 2$, which can account for 67.29%/ 53.04% of the observed LGRBs. This suggests that a substantial portion of LGRBs at $z< 2$ may not be collapsar GRBs, which would challenge the universality of empirical GRB relations and affect their reliability in cosmological applications.
#### The structure and evolution of a high-mass stellar merger in the Hertzsprung gap

 - **Abstract**
 Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.
#### Non-purely transverse Magnus force in superconducting neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 The force acting on a proton vortex in extreme type-II superconducting neutron star matter is studied in the limit of vanishing temperature. A detailed analysis is presented on how momentum is transferred from length scales on the order of the London penetration depth to the vortex core. To examine the momentum flux, expressions for proton and electron currents are derived for arbitrary distances from the vortex line. It is shown that, in the regime of a large electron mean free path, the only force acting directly on the vortex core is the Magnus force. Notably, the correction to the proton current near the vortex core generates a component of the Magnus force aligned with the incident current measured far from the vortex. This contribution, responsible for longitudinal force, is usually overlooked in the literature. The results obtained in this work for a relatively simple problem concerning the force on a vortex in cold matter of neutron stars may also be relevant to other superconducting systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars. We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of 12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$, but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons. However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet formation.
#### Spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star candidates

 - **Abstract**
 Dark Stars, i.e. early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter, could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift Dark Matter halos. In 2023 three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a followup analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z-13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a Dark Star interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic Dark Star candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z-14-1, with the former being the most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify a feature in its spectrum indicative of the smoking gun signature of Dark Stars: the He II$\lambda$1640 absorption line. In view ALMA's recent identification of a probable OIII nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated Dark Star is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations it would imply a Dark Star embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of Dark Stars, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.
