#### Evolution of a Long-Lived Deep-Seated Main-Sequence Magnetic Field During White Dwarf Cooling
 - **Authors:** Matias Castro-Tapia, Maria Camisassa, Shu Zhang

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields that originate from core-convective dynamos during the main-sequence. Using stellar evolution and WD cooling models combined with magnetic field diffusion calculations, we demonstrate that a surviving field from the main-sequence can account for various features observed in magnetic WDs. In particular, the earlier emergence of stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less massive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is because the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less massive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic field due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that many of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can be reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is comparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the main-sequence dynamo. Additionally, our predictions for surface magnetic fields vary by a factor of 2 to 4 when higher-order modes of poloidal magnetic field expansion and turbulent diffusion driven by crystallization-induced convection are included. These effects should therefore be considered when investigating the origin of magnetic fields in individual WDs.
#### Discovery of synchronized periodic variability of methanol maser features in G26.598-0.024

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We report the discovery of periodic maser variability of an unusual pattern in the high-mass young stellar object G26.598-0.024. Methods. A ten-year monitoring of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser was carried out with the Torun 32 m radio telescope. The archival data collected so far were also used to characterize the target with high angular resolution and examine its infrared variability. Results. We found anticorrelated flux variations of the opposite blueshifted and redshifted emission features with a period of 70.1 (2.2) d and the relative amplitude of 1.3 and 0.6, respectively. The light curves are best fit with a sinusoidal function modulated by mild changes in the average flux density on 3-5 yr timescales. The emission of the middle parts of the spectrum shows only long-term variability. High-angular-resolution data indicate that the maser is associated with one of the two 1.3 mm dust emission cores, while the periodic comes from two extended regions ~1500 au apart. We discuss several possible causes of the peculiar variability.
#### Balmer series fluxes from Pop. III Stars: A-SLOTH Predictions for JWST Observability
 - **Authors:** Veronika Lipatova, Simon C.O.Glover, Ralf S. Klessen, Boyuan Liu

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting Population III (Pop. III) stars remains a major observational challenge. Their Balmer series recombination line emission, redshifted into the infrared at $z \sim 5-11$, is a potential tracer. JWST/NIRSpec offers the first opportunity to detect such lines, provided fluxes exceed instrumental sensitivity. This study aims to model the expected luminosities of the first four Balmer series transitions from Pop. III star-forming halos and assess their detectability with JWST/NIRSpec across $5 \leq z \leq 11$. We use the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH with merger trees constructed from the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism and cosmological N-body simulations targeting Milky Way-like halos and the halo population in a 8~Mpc$/h$ box. Predicted fluxes are compared to JWST detection limits derived from the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC) assuming a 10,000 s NIRSpec exposure at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For our default model parameters, Pop. III H$\alpha$ fluxes peak at $\sim10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, 2-3 orders of magnitude below the JWST detection threshold ($\sim6 \times 10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). The fluxes in the other Balmer series lines are weaker than H$\alpha$ and hence are also not detectable. Among the model parameters that we explore, the ionizing photon escape fraction $f_{\mathrm{esc,III}}$ has the strongest effect on Pop. III Balmer series fluxes when changed: reducing $f_\mathrm{esc,III}$ from 0.9 to 0.1 increases the fluxes by $\gtrsim$1 order of magnitude. However, even in this case, the lines remain undetectable. Balmer series lines powered by emission from Pop. III stars will be undetectable by JWST without strong lensing ($\mu \gtrsim 10$). A-SLOTH provides a useful tool to predict emission strengths and assess the detectability of Pop. III stars across cosmic history.
#### Impact of thermal effects on prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 The fate of the remnant following the merger of two neutron stars initially on quasicircular orbits depends primarily on the mass of the initial neutron stars, the mass ratio, and the still-uncertain dense-matter equation of state (EoS). Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature EoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the characteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place either with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse scenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering the threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the uncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the threshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs, combined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS, we find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the thermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal properties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass, i.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the bounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at supranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest differences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk mass as a result.
#### Complex Ionization and Velocity Structures in GX 340+0 X-ray Binary Revealed by XRISM

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-resolution XRISM spectrum of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 340+0, revealing unprecedented detail in its emission and absorption features. The spectrum reveals a rich and complex Fe XXV He$\alpha$ line profile and a P-Cygni profile from Ca XX. We use the state-of-the-art spectral synthesis code Cloudy to model the emission and absorption features in detail. Our analysis reveals multi-ionization and multi-velocity structures, where the combination of broad ($\sim$ 800 km/s) and narrow ($\sim$ 360 km/s) line components, along with rest-frame and blueshifted emission and absorption lines, accounts for the observed line profile complexity. We identify a modest $\sim$ 2735 km/s accretion disk wind exhibiting both absorption and emission features. We also detect a relativistic reflection feature in the spectrum, which we model using relxillNS - specifically designed to characterize X-ray reprocessing in accretion disks around neutron stars. Furthermore, we examine the detailed physics of the Fe XXV He$\alpha$ complex, focusing on the forbidden-to-resonance line ratio under the influence of continuum pumping and optical depth effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Within the molecular clouds of the Camelopardis OB1 association exists a region previously noted as one subgroup. However, bulk clustering from Gaia astrometry has recently shown three distinctive kinematically coherent groups, all found in a similar location in the sky ($137 \lessapprox l\lessapprox145$ and $-2\lessapprox b \lessapprox5$) and at a similar distance ($\sim$1kpc). In this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time, examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available SDSS-V radial velocities, we find the clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous location, based on present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct region and exhibited no influence on each other's formation. Two of the clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association, with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus arm, in the direction of the Per OB1 or Cas 0B6 associations. Overall, this work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel through the Galaxy.
#### Dynamos driven by top-heavy double-diffusive convection in the strong-field regime

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic fields of terrestrial planets are generated in their liquid cores through dynamo action driven by thermal and compositional convection. The coexistence of these two buoyancy sources gives rise to double-diffusive convection (DDC) due to the contrast between thermal and compositional diffusivities. However, most dynamo simulations adopt the co-density model, where the two diffusivities are assumed to be equal. In this study, we performed both hydrodynamic and dynamo simulations of top-heavy DDC in a rotating spherical shell with the Lewis number $Le=100$, and compared them with corresponding co-density models. In the hydrodynamic regime, the convective flow morphology is strongly influenced by the nature of the buoyancy sources. However, our dynamo simulations in the strong-field regime demonstrate that the co-density and DDC models yield qualitatively similar magnetic fields at comparable magnetic Reynolds numbers, albeit with some differences in detail. These numerical models further justify the use of the co-density model in planetary dynamo simulations. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamo models based on DDC and co-density produce similar magnetic fields and secular variations at the core-mantle boundary. This suggests that it may not be possible to distinguish the buoyancy sources responsible for planetary dynamos based solely on magnetic field observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver using directive-based programming with OpenMP target offloading. The solver is integrated into the DISPATCH framework, which organises the computational domain into a collection of asynchronously updated patches. To reduce GPU kernel launch overhead, patches are grouped into "bunches" that are updated collectively. While porting the particular solver required a complete code refactoring, it yielded performance gains on both GPU and CPU. A stand-alone mini-app achieved a 7.3x speed-up compared to a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to seven AMD 7F72 Rome CPU cores. Within the full DISPATCH framework, the GPU-accelerated MHD Bunch solver showed excellent agreement with the CPU-based reference implementation on standard test problems such as the Sod shock tube and Orszag-Tang vortex. In large-scale 3D tests, the GPU implementation achieved a 9.8x overall speedup, comparing one GPU to 12 CPU cores, with the core MHD update routine being two orders of magnitude faster on the GPU than on a single CPU core. These results demonstrate that OpenMP offloading can provide substantial performance improvements for astrophysical codes while maintaining portability and accuracy. The work also demonstrates how new codes should be structured to allow simple and efficient directive-based GPU offloading.
#### Linking planet formation to exoplanet characteristics: C/O as a diagnostic of planet formation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09587

 - **Abstract**
 Gas-giant exoplanets are test cases for theories of planet formation as their atmospheres are proposed to carry signatures of their formation within the protoplanetary disk. The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to distinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines), and mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can now probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in gas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far, ALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and O-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like stars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting gas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with formation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is emerging an arguably "conventional" picture of gas-giant planet formation for transiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising 3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\% accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\% accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.
#### Linear Polarization in a Black Hole, 4U~1957+115 and its X-ray Spectral Analysis

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09692

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new spectro-polarimetric method for estimation of the inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by Sunyaev \& Titarchuk (1985, ST85). The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed that the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\tau_0$, in particular for $\tau_0 >$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\sim 2\%$ was found (Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\tau_0$ and then to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ and the plasma temperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using data from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with $\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\Gamma$ with the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at $\Gamma\sim3$ for high $\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: $M_{1957}=4.8 \pm 1.8~M_{\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.
#### The cosmological lithium problem

 - **Abstract**
 The discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance in Spite plateau stars has been attributed either to a challenge to the standard model of nucleosynthesis or to stellar processes occurring after the stars formed. To understand the origin of this discrepancy, it is crucial to link the cosmic star formation rate with a chemical enrichment model that incorporates the yields of both Population (Pop) III and II stars. It is within this framework that the evolution of lithium can be determined. The primary goal is to demonstrate that there is no discrepancy between the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the observed lithium abundance. By combining a standard chemical evolution model with the hierarchical structure formation scenario, it is possible to determine the lithium abundance as a function of $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]$. The model's results are compared with observational data, including two extremely iron-poor stars: J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708. The Spite plateau is naturally established in the range $-8.0 \lesssim [\mathrm{Fe/H}] \lesssim -2.0$ with $^{7}\mathrm{Li/H}$ $\sim 1.81 \times 10^{-10}$. We find that J0023+0307 could have formed $\sim 4.4 \times 10^{5} - 1.3 \times 10^{6}$ years after the explosion of the first Pop III star in the Universe, whereas for SMSS J0313-6708 this event would have occurred $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{5} - 4.4 \times 10^{5}$ years later. The Spite plateau serves as an observational signature of the formation of Pop III stars. The abundances observed in J0023+0307 and SMSS J0313-6708 are consistent with Pop III progenitor stars in the mass range $10-100 M_{\odot}$. However, if some high-redshift star formation occurs within subhalo-like structures, the contribution of stars in the mass range $140-260 M_{\odot}$ to the formation of the extended Spite plateau cannot be ruled out.
#### Supermassive Neutron Stars in Starobinsky Gravity with Causal Hybrid Stellar Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stellar structure of neutron stars in the framework of Starobinsky gravity, characterized by a quadratic correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$. In order to {\em preserve causality throughout\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for the stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark matter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of hadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20, and BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with static spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of state. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar remains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond 50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid equations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from the extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which also contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM mass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface. Nevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density and mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically. Notably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with the Starobinsky parameter $\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model supporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \, M_\odot$ for $\alpha = 10\,r_g^2$. This theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating configuration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \, M_\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by approximately 20--25\%.
