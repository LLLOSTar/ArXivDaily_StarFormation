#### What's kickin' in partial tidal disruption events?

 - **Abstract**
 Stars partially destroyed by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) can be ejected from the SMBH. Previous investigations attributed this positive-energy/velocity kick to asymmetries in the mass lost by the star near pericenter. We propose that asymmetric mass loss is not predominantly responsible for "kicking" the star, and that these kicks instead arise from the combination of a) the reformation of the core following an initial phase of quasi-ballistic motion, and b) the differential shear between the unbound and marginally bound (to the SMBH) material during this phase. We predict that the kick speed $v_{\rm kick}$ is weakly dependent on the stellar properties, and for SMBH masses $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, $v_{\rm kick}$ is independent of SMBH mass, is not limited to the stellar escape speed $v_{\rm esc}$, and is related to the surviving core mass $M_{\rm c}$ approximately as $v_{\rm kick} \simeq 0.45 \left(M_{\rm c}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/3}$, where $M_{\star}$ is the original stellar mass. For $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$, we find that the maximum-attainable kick speed depends on SMBH mass, satisfies $v_{\rm kick, max} \simeq 0.4 \, v_{\rm esc}\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{1/6}$, and is reached for core masses that satisfy $M_{\rm c}/M_{\star} \lesssim 1.7\left(M_{\bullet}/M_{\star}\right)^{-1/2}$. This model predicts that massive stars with $M_{\star}\gtrsim few\times 10 M_{\odot}$ could be ejected at speeds $\gtrsim (1-2)\times 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$ if stripped of $\gtrsim 50\%$ of their mass.
#### Spectropolarimetry of A Nuclear Transient AT2023clx: Revealing The Geometrical Alignment between The Transient Outflow and The Nuclear Dusty Region

 - **Abstract**
 AT2023clx, which occurred in NGC3799 with a Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Region (LINER), is one of the most nearby nuclear transients classified as a tidal disruption event (TDE). We present three-epoch spectropolarimetric follow-up observations of AT2023clx. We detected two polarization components; one is a constant polarization of $\sim 1\%$ originated from an aspherical outflow associated with the transient, while the other is a blue-excess polarization up to $\sim 2\%$ originated from a nuclear dusty environment via light echoes. Between the two epochs, the polarization angle flipped by 90 degrees, indicating that the direction of the outflow was aligned perpendicular to the dust plane. Such polarization features -- the blue excess and the 90-degree flip -- have never been observed in previous TDE polarization samples, highlighting unique mechanisms behind AT2023clx. We propose possible scenarios to naturally explain the polarization features: the disruption of a star captured by a nuclear dusty cloud around the black hole or a star formed within the cloud. Given the LINER nature of NGC3799, the dusty region may possibly be linked to a torus or disk associated with a weak Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Furthermore, as a more speculative scenario, the event might have been triggered by AGN-like activity, potentially linked to changing-look AGNs or ambiguous nuclear transients.
#### The robust detection and spatial distribution of acetaldehyde in Orion KL: ALMA observations and chemical modeling

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19059

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the organic molecule inventory detected in Orion KL, acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) -- one of the most ubiquitous interstellar aldehydes -- has not been firmly identified with mm-wave interferometry. We analyze extensive ALMA archival datasets (142-355 GHz) to search for acetaldehyde, revealing two distinct acetaldehyde emission peaks and one component with more complex kinematic structures. One peak aligns with MF10/IRc2, where emissions of other O-bearing complex organic molecules are rarely reported, while the other is coincident with the ethanol peak in the hot core-SW. The MF10/IRc2 detection suggests unique chemistry, possibly influenced by repeated heating events. In contrast, co-detection with ethanol indicates an ice origin and suggests a potential chemical relationship between the two species. We determined acetaldehyde column densities and its kinetic temperatures toward these two peaks under LTE assumptions and compare its distribution with ethanol and other molecules that have an aldehyde (HCO) group, such as methyl formate, glycolaldehyde, and formic acid. Toward the ethanol peak, observed abundance ratios between HCO-containing species are analyzed using a chemical model. The model suggests two key points: 1) the destruction of ethanol to form acetaldehyde in the ice may contribute to the observed correlation between the two species, 2) a long cold-collapse timescale and a methyl formate binding energy similar to or lower than water are needed to explain the observations. The relative abundance ratios obtained from the model are highly sensitive to the assumed kinetic temperature, which accounts for the high spatial variability of the aldehyde ratios observed toward Orion KL.

 - **Abstract**
 Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is one of the most complex star clusters in the Milky Way, and likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Being the subject of debate between it hosting an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a collection of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in its center, $\omega$ Cen has been intensively studied over the past decades. Our work focuses on characterizing the properties of binary systems in $\omega$ Cen via multi-epoch MUSE spectroscopic observations spanning over eight years and covering much of its central regions (i.e. core radius). We did not detect any stellar-mass BHs candidates orbiting luminous stars, although mock samples indicate a high sensitivity of our survey to such systems. This suggests that BHs orbiting stars may be rare in $\omega$ Cen or in wide orbits around low-mass companions (where our survey is 50% complete) or that the periods of such systems are longer than expected from cluster dynamics. Additionally, we constrained the orbital properties of 19 binary systems in the cluster, with periods ranging from fractions of a day up to several hundred days. We observe an excess of binaries with P $\ge$ 10 d and find evidence that the intrinsic period distribution of binaries in $\omega$ Cen differs from those predicted by cluster evolutionary models.
#### Growing 3D clouds from 2D maps via full spherization

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19259

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19259

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a novel framework for constructing three-dimensional (3D) objects from two-dimensional (2D) maps, tailored for the analysis of complex structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). The framework extends the Abel transform and the AVIATOR algorithm. By expanding medial-axis trees along the $z$-coordinate and transforming circular components into spheres, we generate 3D objects from 2D flux slices while preserving key structural features such as filament intersections, the spatial distribution of bright cores, and filamentary twists. The framework introduces multiple expansion strategies--random, fiducial, and physical--allowing for different interpretations of the underlying 3D structures. While the column density probability density function (PDF) remains largely invariant across different construction methods, the high degree of freedom in the 3D expansion poses challenges in accurately recovering true spatial configurations in complex regions. Our work provides a flexible, extensible platform for exploring the 3D organization of ISM structures, with potential applications in star formation and molecular cloud analysis.
#### A 1.48-2.48 $\mathrmμ$m R=28000 spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the nearest pair of brown dwarfs: Luhman 16AB

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high signal-to-noise (SNR $\sim$ 450), high-dispersion ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 28\,000$) H- and K-band spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the Luhman 16AB binary (WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1AB): the closest pair of brown dwarfs, and one of the best substellar benchmarks. The spectra were combined from a 70-day spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the binary with IGRINS on Gemini South. We fit model photospheres to the combined high-quality spectra to estimate atmospheric parameters. The model is based on the Sonora model atmosphere further incorporating the effects of clouds and disequilibrium. We detect ammonia (NH3) lines in both binary components, making Luhman 16A the warmest object where individual NH3 lines were identified. We discover hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) lines in both components, following recent reports of these species in either cooler (H2, H2S in a T6 dwarf) or warmer (HF in young late-M or mid-L dwarfs) objects. Methane (CH4) shows a small contribution, with lines sensitive to the slight temperature difference spanning the L/T transition. Against model expectations, we do not detect FeH lines, implying more efficient iron rainout than incorporated in the models. We find various unidentified features in water-dominated regions, likely the result of residual inaccuracies in the water line lists. We searched for planetary-mass companions by periodogram analysis of radial velocities over 70 days but detected no significant signal. The upper limits of projected planetary mass are $M\sin{i}=$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.3 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 1 day, and 0.4 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.7 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 10 days for Luhman 16A and B, respectively.
#### Irradiated Atmospheres II: Interplay Between Scattering and Vertical-Mixing induced Energy Transport

 - **Abstract**
 The scattering is crucial for the atmospheric thermal profiles. The energy transport by the vertical mixing plays an essential role for the greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effect. This work explores the interaction between scattering and vertical mixing, specifically whether these processes enhance or mitigate each other's effects on atmospheric temperature. The interaction between mixing flux and scattering is nonlinear. Our calculations indicate that thermal scattering intensifies the greenhouse effects caused by vertical mixing in the middle atmosphere but reduces it in the lower layers. In the middle atmosphere, increased vertical mixing enhances the warming effect of the thermal scattering while diminishing the cooling effect of visible scattering. In the lower atmosphere, it enhances the anti-greenhouse effect linked to visible scattering and diminishes the greenhouse effect produced by thermal scattering. The combined influence of thermal scattering and vertical mixing on the lower atmosphere's greenhouse effect is weaker than their separate impacts, akin to $1+1<2$. It is also interesting to note that the joint effect may also influence chemistry and cloud formation, altering the thermal structure.
#### A high-resolution survey of protoplanetary disks in Lupus and the nature of compact disks

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the exoplanets discovered in our galaxy to date orbit low-mass stars, which tend to host small disks in their early stages. To better elucidate the link between planet formation and disk substructures, observational biases should be reduced through observations of these small, faint disks at the highest resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In this work, we present new high-resolution (0.03-0.04") ALMA observations at 1.3 mm of 33 disks located in the Lupus star-forming region. Combining archival data and previously published work, we provide a near-complete high resolution image library of 73 protoplanetary (Class II) disks in Lupus. This enable us to measure dust disk radii down to a limit of 0.6 au and analyze intensity profiles using visibility modeling. We show that 67% of Lupus protoplanetary disks have dust radii smaller than 30 au, with new substructures detected in 11, showing some of the shortest separation gaps. The size-luminosity relation in Lupus aligns well with a drift-dominated dust evolution scenario and, for the most compact disks (< 30 au), we found dust masses ranging from 0.3 to 26.3 Earth masses. Assuming that the detected substructures were dynamical effects of planets, we estimated the planet masses to range from 20 to 2000 Earth masses with separations between 2 to 74 au. Our results indicate that two-thirds of the protoplanetary disks in Lupus are smooth, and compact, with substructures being more prominent in the few larger disks. These compact disks are consistent with drift-dominated evolution, with their masses and optical depths suggesting that they may have already experienced some planet formation, with most of the small solids converted into planetesimals and planets. This makes them prime candidates, for explaining the formation and origin of super-Earths. [Abridged]

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way's thin and thick discs is crucial to galaxy formation studies. We derive age and metallicity distributions of the kinematic thick and thin discs using the this http URL pipeline and Gaia DR3 data within 250 pc of the Sun, covering 1 kpc in height. Our results show that the kinematic thick disc is mostly older than 10 Gyr, undergoing three main metallicity enrichment episodes: (1) over 12 Gyr ago, peaking at [M/H] $\sim$ -0.5 dex, (2) $\sim$11 Gyr ago, rapidly increasing to solar [M/H] and spanning [$\alpha$/Fe] from 0.3 to solar, and (3) just over 10 Gyr ago, reaching supersolar metallicities. Meanwhile, the kinematic thin disc began forming $\sim$10 Gyr ago, just as thick disc star formation ended, characterized by supersolar metallicities and low [$\alpha$/Fe]. This transition coincides with the Milky Way's last major merger: Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE). We also identify a subset of kinematic thin disc stars older than 10 Gyr with high/intermediate [$\alpha$/Fe], indicating a transition phase. The age-metallicity relation of the thin disc suggests overlapping star formation episodes and radial mixing in the solar neighborhood, with the greatest spread $\sim$6 Gyr ago. Additionally, we detect an isolated thick disc star formation event at solar metallicity, coinciding with Sagittarius' first pericenter passage. These findings provide precise age-metallicity distributions and star formation rates, offering key insights for chemical evolution models and cosmological simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The environments of young star clusters are shaped by the interactions of the powerful winds of massive stars, and their feedback on the cluster birth cloud. Several such clusters show diffuse gamma-ray emission on the degree scale, which hints at ongoing particle acceleration. Aims: To date, particle acceleration and transport in star-cluster environments are not well understood. A characterisation of magnetic fields and flow structures is necessary to progress toward physical models. Previous work has largely focused on 100 pc scale feedback or detailed modelling of wind interaction of just a few stars. We aim to bridge this gap. We focus in particular on compact clusters to study collective effects arising from stellar-wind interaction. Objects in this class include Westerlund 1 and R136. Methods: We perform 3D ideal-MHD simulations of compact, young, massive star clusters. Stellar winds are injected kinetically for 46 individual very massive stars (M > 40 Msun), distributed in a spherical region of radius 0.6 - 1 pc. We include a sub-population of five magnetic stars with increased dipole field strengths of 0.1 - 1 kG. We study the evolving superbubble over several 100 kyrs. Results: The bulk flow and magnetic fields show an intricate, non-uniform morphology, which is critically impacted by the relative position of individual stars. The cluster wind terminates in a strong shock, which is non-spherical and, like the flow, has non-uniform properties. The magnetic field is both composed of highly tangled sections and coherent quasi-radial field-line bundles. Steep particle spectra in the TeV domain arise naturally from the variation of magnetic field magnitude over the cluster-wind termination shock. This finding is consistent with gamma-ray observations. The scenario of PeV particle acceleration at the cluster-wind termination shock is deemed unlikely.
#### FUV to FIR SED modelling of NGC 205

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19843

 - **Abstract**
 New far ultraviolet imaging of the galaxy NGC 205 is presented, which shows the emission is significantly offset ($\sim5^{\prime\prime}$ NW) from the optical and infrared centers of the galaxy. Spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling is applied to investigate the spatial dependence of the star formation history (SFH) of NGC 205, using data from far ultraviolet to far infrared. The SED model includes young and old stellar populations, gas emission, dust emission and dust absorption. The old stellar population has a total mass of $1.1\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ whereas the young population has a much smaller total mass of 3200 M$_{\odot}$. The best forms of SFH for old and young stars are found to be exponentially declining bursts with start times $t_0$ yr ago and e-folding times $\tau$ yr. The old stellar population has uniform $t_0$=9.5 Gyr, with $\tau$ decreasing with radius from 1 Gyr to 500 Myr. The young stellar population has $t_0$=900 Myr and $\tau$=800 Myr, both uniform across NGC 205. The young and old stellar mass surface densities are exponential in radius with scale lengths of 40 and 110 pc, respectively. The dust heating has a $\sim$40\% contribution from young stars and $\sim$60\% from old stars.
