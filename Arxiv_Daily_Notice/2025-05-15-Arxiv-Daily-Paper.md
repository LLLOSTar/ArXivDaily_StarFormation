#### Black hole spectral states revealed in GRMHD simulations with texture memory accelerated cooling

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray binaries (XRBs) display spectral state transitions that are accompanied by substantial changes in the hardness, luminosity, and structure of the accretion flow. We developed a GPU-accelerated cooling toolkit for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of accreting black holes that uses texture memory for fast retrieval of pre-computed values. The toolkit incorporates bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, inverse Compton radiation and Coulomb collision processes. We implemented our toolkit into a GRMHD code and used it to simulate a magnetically arrested disk in the context of the XRB low/hard state around a Kerr black hole. We explored the mass accretion rate in the $\sim (10^{-6}-0.3) \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ range, where $\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington accretion rate. Our simulations reveal that for low accretion rates ($\dot{M} \lesssim 0.01 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the flow settles into a geometrically thick, low-density, two-temperature hot accretion flow. At higher accretion rates, the flow turns into a cold single-temperature thin disk at $r_{\rm in} \gtrsim 50 r_g$. Inside, the disk breaks up into single-temperature thin filaments embedded into a two-temperature hot thick flow. Our GPU texture memory accelerated cooling prescription is $3-5$ times faster than the standard radiation M1 closure methods, and $\sim5$ times faster than storing the lookup table in global memory.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars, create heavy elements and form black holes and neutron stars. These compact objects often receive a velocity at formation, a "kick" whose physical origin remains debated. We investigate kicks in Be X-ray binaries, containing a neutron star and a rapidly spinning companion. We identify two distinct populations: one with kicks below $10\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, much lower than theoretical predictions, and another with kicks around $100\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, that shows evidence for being aligned within 5 degrees of the progenitor's rotation axis. The distribution of progenitor masses for the two populations have medians around $2.3\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $4.9\,\rm{M}_\odot$, corresponding to stars with birth masses of about $10\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $15\,\rm{M}_\odot$. The second component matches the low-velocity mode observed in isolated pulsars. Combined with the known high-velocity component, which dominates isolated pulsars, this suggests three distinct kick modes. These results reveal previously unrecognized diversity in neutron-star formation.
#### A fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer shapes the properties of binary black hole mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Mass transfer in binary systems is the key process in the formation of various classes of objects, including merging binary black holes (BBHs) and neutron stars. Orbital evolution during mass transfer depends on how much mass is accreted and how much angular momentum is lost $-$ two of the main uncertainties in binary evolution. Here, we demonstrate that there is a fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer (SMT), that is robust against uncertainties in orbital evolution. Based on detailed evolutionary models of interacting systems with a BH accretor and a massive star companion, we show that the post-interaction orbit is always wider than $\sim10R_{\odot}$, even when extreme shrinkage due to L2 outflows is assumed. Systems evolving towards tighter orbits become dynamically unstable and result in stellar mergers. This separation limit has direct implications for the properties of BBH mergers: long delay times ($\gtrsim1 \rm Gyr$), and no high BH spins from the tidal spin-up of helium stars. At high metallicity, the SMT channel may be severely quenched due to Wolf-Rayet winds. The reason for the separation limit lies in the stellar structure, not in binary physics. If the orbit gets too narrow during mass transfer, a dynamical instability is triggered by a rapid expansion of the remaining donor envelope due to its near-flat entropy profile. The closest separations can be achieved from core-He burning ($\sim8-15R_{\odot}$) and Main Sequence donors ($\sim15-30R_{\odot}$), while Hertzsprung Gap donors lead to wider orbits ($\gtrsim30-50R_{\odot}$) and non-merging BBHs. These outcomes and mass transfer stability are determined by the entropy structures, which are governed by internal composition profiles. The formation of compact binaries is thus sensitive to chemical mixing in stars and may relate to the blue-supergiant problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Bright-rimmed, cometary-shaped star-forming globules, associated with HII regions, are remnants of compressed molecular shells exposed to ultraviolet radiation from central OB-type stars. The interplay between dense molecular gas and ionizing radiation, analysed through gas kinematics, provides significant insights into the nature and dynamic evolution of these globules. This study presents the results of a kinematic analysis of the cometary globule, Lynds Bright Nebula (LBN) 437, focusing on the first rotational transition of 12CO and C18O molecular lines observed using the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The averaged 12CO spectrum shows a slightly skewed profile, suggesting the possibility of a contracting cloud. The molecular gas kinematics reveals signatures of infalling gas in the cometary head of LBN 437, indicating the initial stages of star formation. The mean infall velocity and mass infall rate towards the cometary head of LBN 437 are 0.25 km s^-1 and 5.08 * 10^-1 Msun yr^-1 respectively, which align well with the previous studies on intermediate or high-mass star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The crust composition of rocky exoplanets with a substantial atmosphere can not be observed directly. However, recent developments start to allow the observation and characterisation of their atmospheres. Aims. We aim to establish a link between the observable spectroscopic atmospheric features and the mineralogical crust composition of exoplanets. This allows to constrain the surface composition just by observing transit spectra. Methods. We use a diverse set of total element abundances inspired by various rock compositions, Earth, Venus, and CI chondrite as a basis for our bottom-to-top atmospheric model. We assume thermal and chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the planetary surface. Based on the atmospheric models in hydrostatic and chemical equilibrium with the inclusion of element depletion due to cloud formation theoretical transit spectra are calculated. Results. The atmospheric type classification allows constraints on the surface mineralogy especially with respect to sulphur compounds, iron oxides and iron hydroxides, feldspars, silicates and carbon species. Spectral features provide the possibility to differentiate the atmospheric types and thus allow some constraints on the surface composition.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by cosmic rays via radio signals has undergone significant advancements in the last two decades. Numerous ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments routinely capture radio pulses in the MHz to GHz frequency range emitted by EAS. The Monte Carlo simulation of these radio pulses is crucial to enable an accurate reconstruction of the primary cosmic ray energy and to infer the composition of the primary particles. In this work, a comprehensive comparison of the predicted electric field in EAS simulated with CoREAS and ZHAireS was conducted to estimate the systematic uncertainties arising from the use of different simulation packages in the determination of two key shower observables namely, the electromagnetic energy of the EAS and the depth of maximum development ($X_{\rm max}$). For this comparison, input parameters and settings as similar as possible were used in both simulations, along with the same realistic atmospheric refractive index depending on altitude, which is crucial for the prediction of radio emission properties of EAS. In addition, simulated EAS with very similar values of depth of maximum development were selected. Good agreement was found between CoREAS and ZHAireS, with discrepancies in the dominant electric field components generally remaining below $10\%$ across the frequency range of a few MHz to hundreds of MHz, relevant for most radio detection experiments, translating into uncertainties in the determination of energy below $5\%$ and $\simeq 10\,\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ in $X_{\rm max}$.
#### Searching for GEMS: Confirmation of TOI-5573b, a Cool, Saturn-like Planet Orbiting An M-dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 We present the confirmation of TOI-5573b, a Saturn-sized exoplanet on an 8.79-day orbit around an early M-dwarf (3790 K, 0.59 R$\odot$, 0.61 M$\odot$, 12.30 J mag). TOI-5573b has a mass of $112^{+18}_{-19}$ M$\oplus$ (0.35$\pm$0.06 M$\mathrm{Jup}$) and a radius of $9.75\pm0.47$ R$\oplus$ (0.87$\pm$0.04 R$\mathrm{Jup}$), resulting in a density of $0.66^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ g cm$^{-3}$, akin to that of Saturn. The planet was initially discovered by TESS and confirmed using a combination of 11 transits from four TESS sectors (20, 21, 47 and 74), ground-based photometry from the Red Buttes Observatory, and high-precision radial velocity data from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID spectrographs, achieving a 5$\sigma$ precision on the planet's mass. TOI-5573b is one of the coolest Saturn-like exoplanets discovered around an M-dwarf, with an equilibrium temperature of $528\pm10$ K, making it a valuable target for atmospheric characterization. Saturn-like exoplanets around M-dwarfs likely form through core accretion, with increased disk opacity slowing gas accretion and limiting their mass. The host star's super-solar metallicity supports core accretion, but uncertainties in M-dwarf metallicity estimates complicate definitive conclusions. Compared to other GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) orbiting metal-rich stars, TOI-5573b aligns with the observed pattern that giant planets preferentially form around M-dwarfs with super-solar metallicity. Further high-resolution spectroscopic observations are needed to explore the role of stellar metallicity in shaping the formation and properties of giant exoplanets like TOI-5573b.
#### The VELOCE modulation zoo III. Detecting additional pulsation modes in optical spectra of classical Cepheids using semi-partial distance correlation periodograms

 - **Abstract**
 Known for their large amplitude radial pulsations, classical Cepheids are critical standard candles in astrophysics. However, they also exhibit various pulsational irregularities and additional signals that provide deeper insights into their structure and evolution. These signals appear in spectroscopic observations as shape deformations of the spectral lines. Using semi-partial distance correlation periodograms, we analyse high-precision spectroscopic data from the VELOCE project for four stars: $\delta$ Cep, BG Cru, X Sgr, and Polaris. For $\delta$ Cep, our control star, only the main radial mode is detected, confirming its stability and suitability as a benchmark for the method. In BG Cru, a strong additional signal at $\sim 3.01$ d is identified, likely linked to line splitting. X Sgr exhibits dominant additional signals, notably one at $\sim 12.31$ d, also associated with significant line splitting. Polaris reveals multiple low-frequency signals, with the most prominent candidate at $\sim 59.86$ d, which might be linked to the star's rotation period. We explore the semi-partial distance correlation periodograms by incorporating CCFs and their variants, such as the median-subtracted CCFs, which improves the sensitivity to variations in line shape. In particular, the latter enables the faithful detection of primary and additional signals present in the 1D spectra of fainter stars and low-amplitude pulsators. The semi-partial distance correlation periodograms demonstrate their utility for isolating signals associated with line shape variations; although, the analyses are complicated by the presence of artefact subharmonics and a visible low-frequency power increase for Polaris and BG Cru. This study underscores the method's potential for finding new and unexpected signals as well as detailed analyses of Cepheid pulsations and opens new pathways for asteroseismic investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 Angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is important for formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. The effects of magnetic fields are suppressed due to non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, which depend on the degree of ionization. Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary source of ionization in star-forming clouds, and their distribution is nonuniform as it is affected by gas density and magnetic fields. Therefore, CRs, magnetic fields, and gas interact with each other. In this work, we develop a new fully implicit cosmic ray transport module in Athena++ and perform three-dimensional simulations of disk formation from collapse of molecular cloud cores. Since CRs are strongly attenuated in the dense gas at the disk scale, distribution of magnetic fields is considerably altered compared to conventional models assuming a uniform ionization rate. While the total magnetic fluxes accreted onto the disks remain similar as the gas outside the disks remain sufficiently ionized and well coupled, the magnetic fields in the disks are less twisted due to the stronger non-ideal MHD effects. As a consequence, magnetic angular momentum transport is strongly suppressed at the disk scale, resulting in more gravitationally unstable disks with more prominent spiral arms. Our simulations demonstrate influence of non-uniform ionization resulting from CR transport and attenuation on the disk formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The well-known discrepancy in galactic rotation curves refers to the mismatch between observed rotational velocities and the velocities predicted by baryonic matter. In this study we investigate a potential pattern in the discrepancy, which may point to an underlying pattern in dark-halo distributions. By looking at rotational-velocity curves from an alternate perspective, the angular-velocity curves, it appears that the observed angular velocities and their corresponding baryonic predictions differ by a constant shift. That is, the discrepancy may be reduced to a constant angular-velocity term, independent of the radius. We test the generality of the suggested property by analysing 143 high-quality rotation curves. The property appears significant as it performs equally well (or better) than well-established dark-halo models. Compared to a Burkert profile, it is preferred in 60% of the cases, while relative to a Navarro Frenk White profile (NFW), it is superior in 73% of the cases. Next, by including the new phenomenological property within the dynamical equations, we find an explicit expression for the dark-halo profile. The new single-parameter profile is characterised by a remarkable property: it is intrinsically related to the baryonic distribution. Thus, information regarding the cuspy or cored nature of a particular dark halo, according to this profile, is encoded (and explicitly determined) by the respective baryonic behaviour.
#### Discerning internal conditions of pulsating hot subdwarf B stars. Modelling multiple trapped modes in KIC 10001893

 - **Abstract**
 The frequencies of gravity mode oscillations are determined by the chemical, thermal, and structural properties of stellar interiors, facilitating the study of internal mixing mechanisms in stars. We investigate the impact of discontinuities in the chemical composition induced by the formation of an adiabatic semiconvection region during the core helium (He)-burning phase of evolution of hot subdwarf B-type (sdB) stars. We scrutinize the asteroseismic attributes of the evolutionary stages and assess the core He-burning phase by evaluating the parameter linked to the average interval between the deep trapped modes in both sdB evolutionary models and the observations of KIC 10001893. We perform evolutionary and asteroseismic analyses of sdB stars using MESA and GYRE to examine the properties of the semiconvection region. We address the challenges of relying solely on average interval between oscillation mode periods with consecutive radial orders to identify the core He-burning stage. To enhance identification, we propose a new parameter representing the average interval between deep trapped modes during some of the stages of sdB evolutionary models. Additionally, our results show that integrating convective penetration with convective premixing improves our models and yields comparable outcomes without the need for additional model parameters. Our results can advance the development of detailed evolutionary models for sdB stars by refining internal mixing schemes, enhancing the accuracy of pulsation predictions, and improving alignment with observational data.
#### The asymmetry of white dwarf double detonations and the observed scatter around the Phillips relation

 - **Abstract**
 Recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) simulations featuring a double detonation scenario have managed to reproduce the overall trend of the Phillips relation reasonably well. However, most, if not all, multidimensional simulations struggle to reproduce the scatter of observed SNe around this relation, exceeding it substantially. In this study, we investigate whether the excessive scatter around the Phillips relation can be caused by an off-center ignition of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core in the double detonation scenario and if this can help constrain possible SN Ia explosion channels. We simulated the detonation of three different initial CO white dwarfs of $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1\,M_\odot$, artificially ignited at systematically offset locations using the Arepo code. After nucleosynthetic postprocessing, we generated synthetic observables using the Artis code and compared these results against observational data and models of other works. We find that our simulations produce synthetic observables well within the range of the observed data in terms of viewing angle scatter. The majority of the viewing angle variability seems to be caused by line blanketing in the blue wavelengths of intermediate-mass elements and lighter iron-group elements, which are asymmetrically distributed in the outer layers of the ashes. Our results suggest that although the off-center ignition of the CO introduces substantial line of sight effects, it is not responsible for the excessive viewing angle scatter observed in other models. Instead, this effect seems to be caused by the detonation ashes from the rather massive helium (He) shells in current state-of-the-art models. Further reducing the He-shell masses of double detonation progenitors may be able to alleviate this issue and yield observables that reproduce the Phillips relation.
#### Supernova in lost common envelope and SN 2006gy

 - **Abstract**
 A mechanism is proposed for synchronizing core-collapse supernova with a recent loss of a red supergiant (RSG) envelope in the common envelope regime. A perequisite for the synchronization is a moderate RSG expansion during final decade. This scenario is based on the phenomenon of preSN~II dense shell formed at the final stage of 10-20 yr as a result of powerfull mass loss. The energy deposition into the RSG envelope that powers the enormous mass loss rate is able to expand the RSG. The moderate expansion is sufficient for the close secondary component to plunge into the common envelope with a subsequent explosion of stripped helium core. Superluminous SN~2006gy is suggested to be the outcome of this scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing at low frequencies offers a powerful tool for studying the interstellar medium. Additionally, pulsar observations in the ecliptic enables us to study the effects of the solar wind which becomes much more prominent at low radio frequencies. The Irish station of the LOw Frequency ARray (I-LOFAR) is a sensitive low-frequency radio telescope, capable of delivering high-precision data for pulsar studies. We present a comprehensive dataset of times-of-arrival, timing solutions and dispersion measure (DM) time series for seven ecliptic pulsars observed over two-to-three years with I-LOFAR. The primary objectives are to investigate time-dependent dispersion effects and provide high-precision timing data for pulsar timing experiments. We measure DM variations through pulsar timing and analysed these across different ecliptic latitudes to assess the impact of the solar wind on each pulsar. We model the intrinsic pulse-profile variability as a function of frequency. The high-precision DM time series for all seven pulsars exhibit clear variations dependent on their ecliptic latitudes, revealing the impact of the solar wind. Some pulsars show significant changes in their pulse widths across the frequency band, while others remain stable. We examine and quantify the pulse-nulling present in PSR J0826+2637, we report evidence for DM chromaticity in PSR J1645-0317, and we describe how PSR J2145-0750's DM precision is such that it could resolve the ionospheric DM contribution. This makes it a target of interest for telescopes in areas of the globe where the ionospheric electron density is higher, e.g. the Murchison Radio Observatory in Australia. This data release underscores the potential of I-LOFAR, or any standalone international LOFAR station, for advancing low-frequency pulsar studies, particularly in analyses of dispersion in the interstellar medium, the solar wind and the ionosphere.
