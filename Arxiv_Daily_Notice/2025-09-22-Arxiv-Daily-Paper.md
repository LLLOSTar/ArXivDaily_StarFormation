#### Kinematics of Stellar Streams from Globular Clusters Depend on Black Hole Retention and Star Mass: A Selection Effect for Dark Matter Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\,M_\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm, ultralight, or self-interacting DM.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars form in clusters from the gravitational collapse of giant molecular clouds, which is opposed by a variety of physical processes, including stellar feedback. The interplay between these processes determines the star formation rate of the clouds. To study how feedback controls star formation, we use a numerical framework that is optimized to simulate star cluster formation and evolution. This framework, called Torch, combines the magnetohydrodynamical code FLASH with N-body and stellar evolution codes in the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Torch includes stellar feedback from ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae, but, until now, did not include protostellar jets. We present our implementation of protostellar jet feedback within the Torch framework and describe its free parameters. We then demonstrate our new module by comparing cluster formation simulations with and without jets. We find that the inclusion of protostellar jets slows star formation, even in clouds of up to M $= 2 \times 10^4$ M$_{\odot}$. We also find that the star formation rate of our lower mass clouds (M $= 5 \times 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) is strongly affected by both the inclusion of protostellar jets and the chosen jet parameters, including the jet lifetime and injection velocity. We follow the energy budget for each simulation and find that the inclusion of jets systematically increases the kinetic energy of the gas at early times. The implementation of protostellar jet feedback in Torch opens new areas of investigation regarding the role of feedback in star cluster formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we investigate an infrared eruptive source, identified from the decade-long VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV). We named this target after a group of variable sources discovered by VVV, as VVV-WIT-13, with WIT standing for "What Is This?", due to its unique photometric variation behaviour and the mysterious origin of the outburst. This target exhibited an outburst with a 5.7 mag amplitude in the Ks-band, remained on its brightness plateau for 3.5 years, and then rapidly faded to its pre-eruptive brightness afterwards. We aim to reveal the variable nature and outburst origin of VVV-WIT-13 by presenting our follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations along with theoretical models. We gathered photometric time series in both near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We obtained near-infrared spectra during the outburst and decaying stages on XSHOOTER/VLT and FIRE/Magellan, and then fitted the detected molecular absorption features using models from ExoMol. We applied 2D numerical simulations to re-create the observables of the eruptive phenomenon. We observe deep AlO absorption bands in the infrared spectra of VVV-WIT-13, during the outburst stage, along with other more common absorption bands (e.g. CO). Our best-fit model suggests a 600 K temperature of the AlO absorption band. In the decaying stage, the AlO bands disappeared, whilst broad blue-shifted H2 lines arose, a common indicator of stellar wind and outflow. The observational evidence suggests that the CO and TiO features originate from an outflow or a wind environment. We find that VVV-WIT-13 is an eruptive young star with instability occurring in the accretion disk. One favoured theoretical explanation of this event is a disrupted gas clump at a distance of 3 au from the source. If confirmed, this would be the first such event observed in real time.
#### Abundance anomalies in low mass field mergers as evidence of a merger origin for the second generation stars in globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 The canonical formation of second-generation (G2) stars in globular clusters (GCs) from gas enriched and ejected by G1 (primordial) polluters faces substantial challenges, i.e. (i) a mass-budget problem and (ii) uncertainty in the source(s) of the abundance anomaly of light elements (AALE) in G2 stars. The merger of G1 low-mass main-sequence (MS) binaries can overcome (i), but its ability to result in AALE is omitted. We provide evidence of the merger process to explain AALE by relying on highly probable merger remnants in the Galactic disk. We focus on carbon-deficient red-clump giants with low mass of 1.0 M_{\sun} < M $\lesssim$ 2.0 M_{\sun} and hot He-intermediate subdwarfs of supersolar metallicity, both manifesting G2-like AALE incompatible with GC origin. The origin of such rare core He-burning stars as the mergers of [MS star (MSS)]+[helium white dwarf (HeWD)] binaries, evolved from low-mass high-mass ratio (MSS+MSS) ones, is supported by models evolving to either horizontal branch (HB) stars or He subdwarfs via the red giant branch (RGB). Such binaries in the GC NGC 362 contain very young ($\sim$ 4 Myr) extremely low-mass HeWDs, in contrast to much older ($\sim 100$ times) counterparts in open clusters. This agrees with the impact of GC environment on the lifetime of hard binaries: (MSS+HeWD) systems merge there soon after arising from (MSS+MSS) binaries that underwent the common-envelope stage of evolution. From the number and lifetime of the (MSS+HeWD) binaries uncovered in NGC 362, the expected fraction of their progeny RGB G2 stars is estimated to be $\lesssim$10\%. The field merger remnants with G2-like AALE support the merger nature of at least a fraction of G2 stars in GCs. The specific channel [(MSS+MSS) - (MSS+HeWD) - merger product] supported by observations and models is tentatively identified as the channel of formation of the extreme G2 RGB component in GCs.
#### Understanding post-RGB binaries through stable mass transfer

 - **Abstract**
 Post-RGB and post-AGB binaries consist of a primary star that has recently evolved off either the RGB or AGB after losing most of its envelope, and a main-sequence companion. They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive models of rotating very massive stellar cores with mass $\approx 10^2$--$10^4M_\odot$ which are marginally stable to the pair-unstable collapse, assuming that the core is isentropic and composed primarily of oxygen. It is shown that the cores with mass $\lesssim 10^3M_\odot$ can form a massive disk with the mass more than 10% of the core mass around the formed black hole if the core is rotating with more than 30% of the Keplerian limit. We also indicate that the formation of rapidly spinning massive black holes such as the black holes of GW231123 naturally accompanies the massive disk formation. By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope. The detection of such gravitational waves will provide us with important information about a formation process of intermediate mass black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong shocks occurring in supernova remnants (SNRs), and their interaction with an often anisotropic surrounding medium, make SNRs ideal laboratories for studying the production and acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Due to their complex morphology and phenomenology, different CR populations are expected to exist throughout the remnants, each characterized by its own energy spectrum. A comprehensive understanding of particle acceleration mechanisms and energetics in SNRs requires spatially resolved spectral and morphological studies. We want to highlight the crucial role of high-resolution radio images at high frequencies (> 10 GHz) for studying the spectral properties of different remnant regions and better constraining the models that describe their non-thermal emission from radio to $\gamma$-ray wavelengths. We studied the integrated radio spectrum of the SNR Kes 73 using single-dish observations performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) between 6.9 and 24.8 GHz, complemented by published data. The high-resolution map at 24.8 GHz was used to search for spatial variations in the spectral index across the remnant. We present the SRT images of Kes 73, providing the highest-frequency morphological and spectral characterization ever obtained for this source. By combining our 18.7 and 24.8 GHz maps with previously published interferometric images at 1.4 and 5 GHz, we identify a flatter spectrum in the western bright region compared to the rest of the shell. In the same region, we detect overlapping $^12$CO molecular emission and $\gamma$-ray radiation, providing strong evidence of SNR-molecular cloud interaction and enhanced CR production. We modelled the non-thermal radio to $\gamma$-ray emission from this region, favouring a lepto-hadronic scenario with a maximum electron energy of 1.1 TeV and a magnetic field strength of 25 $\mu$G.

 - **Abstract**
 CORSIKA 8 is a modern, flexible framework for simulating particle cascades in air and dense media, allowing for fully customizable shower simulations. The radio module autonomously handles electric field calculations and propagation to observer locations. It supports simultaneous simulations with both the ``Endpoint formalism'' as implemented in CoREAS and the ``ZHS'' algorithm from ZHAireS. In this contribution, we validate the radio module by comparing air-shower simulations in CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7, and ZHAireS. We investigate the impact of simulation parameters, such as the step size of particle tracks, on the resulting radio signals and perform a detailed comparison of the ``Endpoints'' and ``ZHS'' formalisms. For the same underlying showers simulated with CORSIKA 8 with optimized step sizes, both formalisms converge to the same radiation energy within 2%. For CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7, agreement on the radiation energy is better than 10% in the 30-80 MHz band and improves to better than 2% for 50-350 MHz. This consistency provides further confirmation of the accuracy of microscopic air-shower radio emission simulations which is crucial for precise energy scale estimations using radio detection.
#### The GECKOS Survey: revealing the formation history of a barred galaxy via structural decomposition and resolved spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Disentangling the (co-)evolution of individual galaxy structural components remains a difficult task owing to the inability to cleanly isolate light from spatially overlapping components. In this pilot study of PGC 044931, observed as part of the GECKOS survey, we utilise VIRCAM $H$-band imaging to decompose the galaxy into five photometric components, three of which contribute $>50\%$ of light in given regions: a main disc, a boxy/peanut bulge, and a nuclear disc. When the photometric decompositions are mapped onto MUSE observations, we find remarkably good separation in stellar kinematic space. All three structures occupy unique locations in the parameter space of the ratio of stellar line-of-sight velocity ($\rm{V}_{\star}$) and dispersion, ($\sigma_{\star}$), and high order stellar skew, ($h_{3}$). These clear and distinct kinematic signatures give us confidence to make inferences about the formation history of the individual components from observations of the mean light-weighted stellar age and metallicity of the three components. A clear story emerges: one in which an extended galactic disc hosted continued star formation, possibly with the addition of accreted pristine gas. Within the disc, a bar formed and buckled early, building a nuclear disc that continued to enrich via multiple generations of star formation. These results exemplify how careful photometric decompositions, combined with well-resolved stellar kinematic information, can help separate out age-metallicity relations of different components and therefore disentangle the formation history of the galaxy. The results of this pilot survey are applicable to modern, well-resolved spectroscopic galaxy surveys.
#### Revising core powered mass loss: A critical assessment of the "energy limited" argument

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme conditions in the early stages of planetary evolution are thought to shape its subsequent development. High internal temperatures from giant impacts can provide sufficient energy to drive extreme volatile loss, with hydrogen being most readily lost. However, the conditions required for maintaining a primordial atmosphere over geological timescales remain enigmatic. This paper revisits the core powered mass loss model for hydrogen removal from planetary atmospheres. One popular approach is to combine mass continuity at the sonic point with an energy-based constraint. We demonstrate that the so-called ``energy limited'' component of this model is unnecessary because atmospheric loss following giant impacts is governed solely by conditions at the sonic point. By simulating a broad range of synthetic exoplanets, varying in planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and temperature, we find that the ``energy limited'' model can underestimate the mass loss rates by up to eight orders of magnitude. Our findings suggest that, for sufficiently hot post-impact surface conditions, hydrogen rich atmospheres can be removed on dynamical timescales that are far shorter than one million years.
#### JWST-TST DREAMS: Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere of the Neptune-mass planet HAT-P-26 b from NIRSpec G395H transmission spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-26 b (18.6 Earth masses, 6.33 Earth radii), based on a single transit observed with the JWST NIRSpec G395H grating. We detect water vapor (ln B = 4.1), carbon dioxide (ln B = 85.6), and sulfur dioxide (ln B = 13.5) with high confidence, along with marginal indications for hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide (ln B < 0.5). The detection of SO2 in a warm super-Neptune sized exoplanet (radius about 6 Earth radii) bridges the gap between previous detections in hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, highlighting the role of disequilibrium photochemistry across a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres, including those cooler than 1000 K. Our precise measurements of carbon, oxygen, and sulfur indicate an atmospheric metallicity of about 10 times solar and a sub-solar C/O ratio. Retrieved molecular abundances are consistent within 2 sigma with predictions from self-consistent models including photochemistry. The elevated CO2 abundance and possible H2S signal may also reflect sensitivities to the thermal structure, cloud properties, or additional disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing. We compare the SO2 abundance in HAT-P-26 b with that of ten other JWST-observed giant exoplanets, and find a correlation with atmospheric metallicity. The trend is consistent with the prediction from Crossfield (2023), showing a steep rise in SO2 abundance at low metallicities, and a more gradual increase beyond 30 times solar. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).
#### The GUAPOS project. VI: the chemical inventory of shocked gas

 - **Abstract**
 The study of the chemical composition of star-forming regions is key to understand the chemical ingredients available during the formation of planetary systems. Given that the chemical inventory on interstellar dust grains in the prestellar phases might be altered due to the prostostellar warm-up, an alternative to infer the chemical composition on the grains could be to observe regions affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. Such shocks can desorb the molecules, and might produce less chemical processing due to shorter timescales. We present here a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using GUAPOS data (G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey). We report here the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologues). We performed a comparison of the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived towards the hot core of G31.41+0.31, finding that they are poorly correlated, excepting N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios due to thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the icy mantle composition. The similarity of molecular ratios between the N-bearing species in the G31.41 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are desorbed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, we have found that the abundances in the G31.41 shock show better correlations with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a Galactic Center molecular cloud). This suggests a negligible gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains, and that the ice-mantle composition is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce SpectraPyle, a versatile spectral stacking pipeline developed for the Euclid mission's NISP spectroscopic surveys, aimed at extracting faint emission lines and spectral features from large galaxy samples in the Wide and Deep Surveys. Designed for computational efficiency and flexible configuration, SpectraPyle supports the processing of extensive datasets critical to Euclid's non-cosmological science goals. We validate the pipeline using simulated spectra processed to match Euclid's expected final data quality. Stacking enables robust recovery of key emission lines, including Halpha, Hbeta, [O III], and [N II], below individual detection limits. However, the measurement of galaxy properties such as star formation rate, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicity are biased at stellar mass below log10(M*/Msol) ~ 9 due to the flux-limited nature of Euclid spectroscopic samples, which cannot be overcome by stacking. The SFR-stellar mass relation of the parent sample is recovered reliably only in the Deep survey for log10(M*/Msol) > 10, whereas the metallicity-mass relation is recovered more accurately over a wider mass range. These limitations are caused by the increased fraction of redshift measurement errors at lower masses and fluxes. We examine the impact of residual redshift contaminants that arises from misidentified emission lines and noise spikes, on stacked spectra. Even after stringent quality selections, low-level contamination (< 6%) has minimal impact on line fluxes due to the systematically weaker emission of contaminants. Percentile-based analysis of stacked spectra provides a sensitive diagnostic for detecting contamination via coherent spurious features at characteristic wavelengths. While our simulations include most instrumental effects, real Euclid data will require further refinement of contamination mitigation strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the {\it James-Webb Space Telescope} ({\it JWST}). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of $\sim 100\,M_{\odot}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the ``Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system ($z = 2.381$) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of $\sim 60$ transients per pointing in {\it JWST} observations with a $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim 29\,m_{AB}$. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of $\sim46.5\,$mag at $z \approx 2.4$ can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of the Cosmic Horseshoe with would allow one to better probe the nature of Dark Matter and the star formation properties, such as the initial mass function at the cosmic noon, via lensed star transients.
