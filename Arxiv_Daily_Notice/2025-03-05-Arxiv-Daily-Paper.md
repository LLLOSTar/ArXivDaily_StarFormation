#### Nuclear Neural Networks: Emulating Late Burning Stages in Core Collapse Supernova Progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 One of the main challenges in modeling massive stars to the onset of core collapse is the computational bottleneck of nucleosynthesis during advanced burning stages. The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\:\%$ and the nuclear energy generation by $250-750\:\%$, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of neutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from $100-10^{6}\:\%$. While further work is needed to enhance their accuracy and applicability to different stellar conditions, integrating NNN trained models into stellar evolution codes is promising for facilitating large-scale generation of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors with higher physical fidelity.

 - **Abstract**
 The difference between the total neutrino mass estimates ($\sum m_\nu$) derived from cosmological data within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and those obtained from terrestrial particle physics experiments underscores the need to explore alternative scenarios. Recent analyses have shown that a dynamic dark energy modeled by the CPL parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS) can ease the constraints on $\sum m_\nu$, thus alleviating this tension. This study investigates the robustness of this discrepancy by assessing the extent to which the CPL assumption influences the results. We examine how other EoS parameterizations, such as the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP) parameterizations, affect $\sum m_\nu$ estimates. We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis combining the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, which includes information on temperature, polarization, and lensing, as well as the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae observations. While both the BA and JBP parameterizations can also resolve the tension, our results show a correlation between the dark energy EoS and the constraints on neutrino mass.

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Recent JWST observations have revealed an intricate filamentary network of unshocked ejecta in the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A (Cas A), offering new insights into supernova (SN) explosions and ejecta evolution. We investigate the origin and evolution of this structure by (i) characterizing its 3D morphology and kinematics and (ii) identifying the physical mechanisms driving its formation. Using high-resolution hydrodynamic (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we model the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from explosion to a remnant age of 1000 years. The initial conditions, set just after shock breakout, are based on a 3D neutrino-driven SN model matching Cas A's basic properties. We find that magnetic fields have little impact on unshocked ejecta evolution, so we focus on HD simulations. A web-like filamentary structure, consistent with JWST observations (down to $\sim 0.01$ pc), naturally forms during the explosion. These filaments arise from early post-collapse processes, including neutrino-heated bubble expansion, hydrodynamic instabilities during blast propagation, and the Ni-bubble effect after shock breakout. The reverse shock later disrupts the filaments via hydrodynamic instabilities, rendering them unobservable by $\sim 700$ years. Our models suggest that JWST-detected filaments in Cas A preserve a 'memory' of early explosion conditions, tracing processes active during and immediately after the SN event. Notably, a filamentary network akin to Cas A's emerges naturally from a neutrino-driven SN explosion.
#### Thermal Phase Curves in Hot Gas Giant Exoplanets Exhibit a Complex Dependence on Planetary Properties

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of uniformly processed 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m band exoplanet thermal phase curves based on Infrared Array Camera observations obtained from the Spitzer Heritage Archive. The catalog includes phase curve measurements for 34 planets, 16 of which contain full orbit coverage and have detectable secondary eclipses in both channels. The data are processed in the EXCALIBUR pipeline using a uniform analysis consisting of aperture photometry and modeling of instrument effects along with the exoplanet signal. Nearest-neighbors regression with a Gaussian kernel is used to correct for instrumental systematics correlated to the star's centroid position and shape in conjunction with a novel test to avoid overfitting. These methods may have utility in addressing sub-pixel gain variations present in modern infrared detectors. We analyze the 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m phase curve properties and find a strong wavelength-dependent difference in how the properties correlate with physical parameters as well as evidence that the phase curve properties are determined by multiple physical parameters. We suggest that differences between the 3.6-$\mu$m and 4.5-$\mu$m phase curve properties are due to 3.6~$\mu$m observations probing regions of the atmosphere which could include a cloud layer. Taken together, the observed phase curve behavior suggests that different physical processes are responsible for establishing the thermal phase curve at different pressures, which are probed by different wavelengths, and that further 3D GCM modeling is required to investigate the reason for this complex dependence on planetary properties.
#### Their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action. I: Fundamental limits to orbit reconstruction due to non-conservation of stellar actions

 - **Abstract**
 The conservation of stellar actions is a fundamental assumption in orbit reconstruction studies in the Milky Way. However, the disc is highly dynamic, with time-dependent, non-axisymmetric features like transient spiral arms and giant molecular clouds (GMCs) driving local fluctuations in the gravitational potential on top of the near-axisymmetric background. Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and star formation, we quantify the rate at which these effects drive non-conservation of the actions of young stars from Myr to Gyr timescales. We find that action evolution is well described as a logarithmic random walk, with vertical action evolving more rapidly than radial action; the diffusion rate associated with this random walk is weakly dependent on the stellar birth environment and scales approximately linearly with the galactic orbital frequency at a star's position. The diffusion rates we measure imply a fundamental limit of $\sim 100$ Myr as the timescale over which stellar orbits can be reliably reconstructed using methods that assume action conservation. By comparing diffusion rates for younger stars to those measured for an older and more vertically-extended control population, we conclude that radial action evolution is driven primarily by transient spiral arms, while vertical action evolution is driven by gravitational scattering off gaseous structures. Our results have significant implications for galactic archaeology and disc dynamics studies, necessitating a closer look at the timescales over which actions are assumed to be conserved in the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids are not only excellent standard candles, but also invaluable tools to test stellar evolution and pulsation theories. Rates of their pulsation period change, quantified usually through $O-C$ diagrams, can be confronted with predictions of stellar evolution theory. On the other hand, period changes on much shorter time scales ($\sim$10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$days), attributed to non-evolutionary effects are often detected and lack detailed explanation. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. We analysed part of the OGLE data for classical Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs; from both Large Magellanic Cloud, LMC, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC) using the modified Hertzsprung $O-C$ technique. A sample of 3658 stars, with the best quality data and void of additional low-amplitude periodicities (e.g. due to non-radial pulsations), that could impact the results, was selected for analysis. Based on $O-C$ shapes, stars were classified into three categories: no period change (class 1), linear period change (class 2), and irregular change (class 3). In our investigation, $33.5\pm0.7$\% of analysed stars show irregular period changes. Considering the pulsation mode, irregular period changes were detected in $16.5\pm0.7$\% of the analysed fundamental mode stars and in $68.1\pm1.2$\% of the first overtone stars. The amplitude of variability in the $O-C$ diagrams increases with the pulsation period, and at a given pulsation period, it is larger for first overtone stars. While the increase is linear for first overtone stars, for fundamental mode stars it becomes steeper as the pulsation period increases.

 - **Abstract**
 A unique galaxy at z = 2.2, zC406690, has a striking clumpy large-scale ring structure that persists from rest UV to near-infrared, yet has an ordered rotation and lies on the star-formation main sequence. We combine new JWST/NIRCam and ALMA band 4 observations, together with previous VLT/SINFONI integral field spectroscopy and HST imaging to re-examine its nature. The high-resolution H$\alpha$ kinematics are best fitted if the mass is distributed within a ring with total mass $M_{\rm{ring}} = 2 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ and radius $R_{ring}$ = 4.6 kpc, together with a central undetected mass component (e.g., a "bulge") with a dynamical mass of $M_{bulge} = 8 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$. We also consider a purely flux emitting ring superposed over a faint exponential disk, or a highly "cuspy" dark matter halo, both disfavored against a massive ring model. The low-resolution CO(4-3) line and 142GHz continuum emission imply a total molecular and dust gas masses of $M_{mol,gas} = 7.1 \times 10^{10}M_\odot$ and $M_{dust} = 3 \times 10^8 M_\odot$ over the entire galaxy, giving a dust-to-mass ratio of 0.7%. We estimate that roughly half the gas and dust mass lie inside the ring, and that $\sim 10\%$ of the total dust is in a foreground screen that attenuates the stellar light of the bulge in the rest-UV to near-infrared. Sensitive high-resolution ALMA observations will be essential to confirm this scenario and study the gas and dust distribution.
#### Subclustering and Star Formation Efficiency in Three Protoclusters in the Central Molecular Zone

 - **Abstract**
 We present so far the highest resolution ($\sim$0.04") ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of three massive star-forming clumps in the Central Molecular Zone, namely 20 km s$^{-1}$ C1, 20 km $^{-1}$ C4, and Sgr C C4, which reveal prevalent compact millimeter emission. We extract the compact emission with $\textit{astrodendro}$ and identify a total of 199 fragments with a typical size of $\sim$370 AU, which represent the first sample of candidates of protostellar envelopes and disks and kernels of prestellar cores in these clumps that are likely forming star clusters. Compared with the protoclusters in the Galactic disk, the three protoclusters display a higher level of hierarchical clustering, likely a result of the stronger turbulence in the CMZ clumps. Compared with the mini-starbursts in the CMZ, Sgr B2 M and N, the three protoclusters also show stronger subclustering in conjunction with a lack of massive fragments. The efficiency of high-mass star formation of the three protoclusters is on average one order of magnitude lower than that of Sgr B2 M and N, despite a similar overall efficiency of converting gas into stars. The lower efficiency of high-mass star formation in the three protoclusters is likely attributed to hierarchical cluster formation.
#### The highly magnetic Wolf-Rayet binary HD 45166 resolved with VLTI/GRAVITY

 - **Abstract**
 HD 45166 was recently reported to be a long-period binary comprising a B7V star and a highly magnetic ($\langle B \rangle = 43.0\pm0.5\,$kG) hot Wolf-Rayet-like component, dubbed as a quasi Wolf-Rayet (qWR) star in literature. While originally proposed to be a short-period binary, long-term spectroscopic monitoring suggested a 22.5 yr orbital period. With a derived dynamical mass of $2.03\pm0.44\,M_\odot$, the qWR component is the most strongly magnetized non-degenerate object ever detected and a potential magnetar progenitor. However, the long period renders the spectroscopic orbital solution and dynamical mass estimates uncertain, casting doubts on whether the qWR component is massive enough to undergo core-collapse. Here, we spatially resolve the HD 45166 binary using newly acquired interferometric data obtained with the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Due to the calibrator star being a binary as well, we implement a new approach for visibility calibration and test it thoroughly using archival GRAVITY data. The newly calibrated HD 45166 data reveal the unmistakable presence of a companion to the qWR component with an angular separation of $10.9\pm0.1$ mas (which translates to a projected physical separation of $10.8\pm0.4$ au), consistent with the long-period orbit. We obtain a model-independent qWR mass $M_{\rm qWR} = 1.96^{+0.74}_{-0.54}\,M_\odot$ using interferometric and spectroscopic data together. This observation robustly confirms that HD 45166 is truly a long-period binary, and provides an anchor point for accurate mass determination of the qWR component with further observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability is a promising mechanism for planetesimal formation. The instability can rapidly form dense clumps that collapse self-gravitationally, which is efficient for large dust grains with the Stokes number on the order of 0.1. However, dust growth models predict that collisional fragmentation prevents dust grains from growing to such sizes. We perform local simulations of the streaming instability and measure characteristic collision velocities and collision rates of dust grains based on their trajectories in moderate clumping. The collision velocities are on the order of 0.1 percent of the sound speed or lower, implying that dust grains can overcome the fragmentation barrier via the clumping. We also find that the collision rates are appreciably high regardless of the low collision velocities. Corresponding timescales are on the order of ten Keplerian periods or shorter, suggesting that dust grains can overcome the drift barrier as well. This streaming-instability-assisted (SI-assisted) coagulation greatly relaxes the conditions for planetesimal formation as recently implied.
#### Quantified Estimation of Molecular Detections across Different Classes of Neptunian Atmospheres Using Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy: Prospects for Future Extremely Large Telescopes with High-Resolution Spectrographs

 - **Abstract**
 Neptune-size exoplanets are less studied as characterizing their atmospheres presents challenges due to their relatively small radius and atmospheric scale height. As the most common outcome of planet formation, these planets are crucial for understanding planetary formation, migration theories, atmospheric composition, and potential habitability. Their diverse atmospheres, influenced by equilibrium temperature, composition, and cloud presence, offer unique opportunities to study atmospheric dynamics and chemistry. While low-resolution spectroscopy struggles with atmospheric characterization due to clouds, high-resolution observations provide detailed analysis of the atmospheres by detecting molecular lines beyond the cloud deck. This study investigates four subclasses of Neptune atmospheres: HAT-P-11 b (warm Neptune), HD 63433 c (warm sub-Neptune), K2-25 b (temperate Neptune), and TOI-270 d (temperate sub-Neptune), using six ground-based spectrographs: GIANO-B, CARMENES, IGRINS, HISPEC, MODHIS, and ANDES over one and three transits. Our simulation integrates the chemical kinetics model, VULCAN with the 1-D line-by-line radiative transfer model, petitRADTRANS, and estimates detection significance using the ground-based noise simulator, SPECTR. We aim to predict how future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) such as TMT (MODHIS) and E-ELT (ANDES) can utilize their higher resolving powers and larger collecting areas to surpass current observatories in detecting molecular bands. We highlight the importance of photochemistry in these atmospheres and demonstrate how ELTs will help further in constraining nitrogen and sulfur chemistry. Finally, we present a comprehensive picture of cloud presence in the atmospheres and its impact on molecular detectability in Neptune-class atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon in physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations have shown that the probability density functions (PDFs) of gas densities in supersonic systems tend to be skewed, exhibiting low-density exponential tails on the $s = \ln{\rho}$ scale. In this work, we argue that these exponential tails originate from the convolution of PDF kernels with skewed tails, which can appear at both ends of the PDF. We introduce two density-fraction strategies -- the mass-fraction and volume-fraction approaches -- to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. The PDF kernels constructed in this work satisfy the relation that its structural entropy equals the PDF variance, as we proposed in Paper I. These two types of PDF kernels define two spaces of skewed PDFs, which are dual to each other and possess highly symmetric mathematical structures. We thus speculate that the high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be related to the power-law tails of the column-density PDFs (on the $\rho$ scale) of molecular clouds, which are shaped by both turbulence and gravity. Inspired by this, we further construct a form of an `isothermal' turbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.
#### Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos from dense environments are unique laboratories for astrophysics, particle physics and many-body physics. They tell us about the last stages of the gravitational core-collapse and the explosion of massive stars. These elusive particles are also tightly linked to heavy elements synthesis in gravitational core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, or play a pivotal role at the MeV epoch during the Universe expansion. We highlight theoretical and observational aspects of this interesting domain, in particular for the future measurement of neutrinos from the next core-collapse supernova, and of the diffuse supernova background, whose discovery might lie in the forthcoming future.

 - **Abstract**
 The spiral structure of the Milky Way is not conclusive, even for the disc regions in the solar neighbourhood. Especially, the arm-like structures uncovered from the over-density maps of evolved stars are inconsistent with the commonly adopted spiral arm models based on young objects. We aim to re-examine the arm segments traced by young objects and better understand the nearby spiral structure. We identify the exciting stars of 459 hii regions and calculate their parallax-based distances according to the Gaia DR3. Together with other hii regions with spectrophotometric or parallax-based distances in literature, the largest ever sample of 572 hii regions with accurate distances is used to reveal the features shown in their distributions projected onto the Galactic disc. The results are then compared to the features traced by other young objects (high-mass star-forming region masers, O-type stars, and young open clusters) and evolved stars. The structures outlined by different kinds of young objects do not exhibit significant deviation from each other. The distributions of young objects are in agreement with three arm-like features emerging in the over-density map of evolved stars. Especially, the Local Arm outlined by young objects follows an arm-like feature delineated by evolved stars and probably spirals outwards towards the direction of $\ell \sim 240^\circ$ in the third Galactic quadrant. We conclude that the arm segments traced by young objects and evolved stars are consistent with each other at least in the solar neighbourhood. In particular, the Local Arm delineated by young objects is reinterpreted as an arm segment with a large pitch angle of $25.2^\circ \pm 2.0^\circ$, whose inner edge is in good agreement with the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave.

 - **Abstract**
 SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova that exploded in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 at a distance of approximately 7 Mpc, making it one of the closest supernovae of the decade. This SN shows clear signs of interaction with a dense circumstellar material, and several studies have investigated the properties of its possible progenitor star using pre-explosion data. In this work we aim to constrain the progenitor properties of SN 2024ggi by performing hydrodynamical modeling of its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024ggi obtained in the Complejo Astronómico El Leoncito, in Las Campanas Observatory, and in Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, spanning from 2 to 106 days after explosion. We constructed its bolometric light curve and we characterize it by calculating its morphological parameters. Then, we computed a grid of one dimensional explosion models for evolved stars with varying masses and estimated the properties of the progenitor star of SN 2024ggi by comparing the models to the observations. The observed bolometric luminosity and expansion velocities are well-matched by a model involving the explosion of a star in the presence of a close circumstellar material (CSM), with a zero-age main sequence mass of $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}$ = 15 $M_{\odot}$, a pre-SN mass and radius of 14.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 517 $R_{\odot}$, respectively, an explosion energy of $1.3\times10^{51}$ erg, and a nickel mass below 0.035 $M_{\odot}$. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor suffered a mass-loss rate of $4 \times 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, confined to a distance of 3000 $R_{\odot}$. The CSM distribution is likely a two-component structure that consists of a compact core and an extended tail. This analysis represents the first hydrodynamical model of SN 2024ggi with a complete coverage of the plateau phase.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction between gas and dust in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) plays a crucial role in setting the stage of planet formation. In particular, the streaming instability (SI) is well recognized as the mechanism for planetesimal formation out of this interaction. The outer region of PPDs is likely subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), representing a major source of disk turbulence characterized by vertical corrugation that leads to strong dust stirring. In the meantime, the VSI turbulence in 3D generates vortices through the Rossby wave instability (RWI), which can trap dust and thereby promote dust concentration. In this study, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to conduct 2D axisymmetric global simulations of PPDs with mesh refinement and 3D global simulations with modest resolution. In 2D, the VSI corrugation mode is weakened by dust back-reaction, while the SI can still survive regardless of initial conditions. Dust clumping occurs and is seeded by VSI-induced zonal flows. In 3D, dust can settle even more with increased dusty buoyancy, suppressing the VSI corrugation mode. Meanwhile, dust back-reaction enhances dust concentration in RWI vortices, though higher resolution is needed to assess dust clumping.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is one of the most important interstellar molecules. While it is considered that it forms on the surface of interstellar dust grains, the exact contribution of different chemical mechanisms is still poorly constrained. Traditionally it is deemed that the CO + OH reaction occurring on top of ices is the main reaction path for its formation. Recent investigations showed that in reality the reaction presents a more complex mechanism, requiring an additional H-abstraction step. Building on our previous works, we carried out a detailed investigation of such H abstraction reactions with the hydrogen atom as a reactant for the abstraction reaction. We found an unconventional chemistry for this reaction, markedly depending on the isomeric form of the HOCO radical prior to reaction. The favored reactions are t-HOCO + H -> CO + H$_2$O, c-HOCO + H -> CO$_2$ + H$_2$ and t/c-HOCO + H -> c/t-HCOOH. We estimate bounds for the rate constants of the less favored reaction channels, t-HOCO + H -> CO$_2$ + H and c-HOCO + H -> CO + H$_2$O, to be approximately 10$^{4-6}$ s$^{-1}$. However, these estimates should be interpreted cautiously due to the significant role of quantum tunneling in these reactions and the complex electronic structure of the involved molecules, which complicates their study. Our findings underscore the need for detailed investigation into the chemistry of interstellar CO$_2$ and pave the way for a reevaluation of its primary formation mechanisms in the interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the survey for organics in the southern hemisphere by observing two cores in the Chamaeleon complex using NASA's Deep Space Network 70-m antenna in Canberra, Australia, over the frequency range of 18 to 25 GHz. We surveyed the class 0 protostar Cha-MMS1 and the prestellar core Cha-C2, which represent two stages in the evolution of dense cores. We detect several molecules including HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_4$H, CCS, C$_3$S, NH$_3$, and c-C$_3$H$_2$. A longer cyanopolyyne, HC$_7$N, is detected with high confidence via spectral stacking analysis. While molecular column densities in the two Chamaeleon cores are typically an order of magnitude lower compared to the cynaopolyyne peak in TMC-1, the molecular abundance ratios are in general agreement with the TMC-1 values. The two exceptions are c-C$_3$H$_2$, which is enhanced by a factor of \about 25 with respect to cyanopolyynes in the Chamaeleon cores, and ammonia, which is enhanced by a factor of ~ 125. The deuterated species c-C$_3$HD is detected in both cores, with a high D/H ratio of ~0.23 in c-C$_3$H$_2$. A rare isotopologue of ammonia, $^{15}$NH$_3$, is also detected in Cha-MMS1 suggesting a high $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of ~ 690 in ammonia. However, this ratio may be artificially enhanced due to the high optical depth of the $^{14}$NH$_3$ (1,1) line, which increases the effective source size. We use the detections of ammonia, cyanopolyynes, and far-infrared dust continuum to characterize the density and temperature in the Chamaeleon cores and calculate the molecular column densities and their relative ratios. The ring molecule benzonitrile is not detected in either Chamaeleon core. The $3 \sigma$ upper limits for its column density are a factor of 2 higher than the value derived for TMC-1 and the upper limits for its relative abundance with respect to HC$_5$N are a factor of 3 higher than the TMC-1 value.
