 - **Abstract**
 The Roman Space Telescope, equipped with a 2.4 meter primary mirror and optical--NIR wide-field camera, promises to revolutionize our understanding of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. One of the Roman Core Community Surveys is the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS), which will measure more than 10,000 SN Ia light curves but obtain a fraction of this number with spectra. The remaining SNe will have to be photometrically classified to achieve the full potential of the Roman HLTDS. To investigate transient yields and classifications, Rose et al. (in prep.) updated the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) framework (originally developed for the Vera Rubin Observatory) for the Roman HLTDS. This study leverages this Roman Hourglass dataset to train and evaluate the ParSNIP (Parameterized Supernova Identification Pipeline) model. We employ this model to classify various transient types from photometric data, paying particular attention to the types most represented in the dataset: normal SNe Ia, 91bg-like SNe Ia, SNe Iax, and CC SNe. The ParSNIP model performance is assessed through confusion matrices and ROC curves across different redshift ranges. Our analysis reveals that while the model performs robustly at higher redshifts (with the AUC for classification varying between 0.9 and 0.95 in the range 0.5 < z < 2), its accuracy dips at the lowest redshifts of the survey, likely due to limited training data. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring adequate representation of classes in the training set. This work underscores the value of machine learning models for next-generation surveys, paving the way for future studies with the Roman Space Telescope for survey optimization, cosmological forecasts, and synergies with other surveys.
#### Tracing cosmic gas in filaments and halos: Low-redshift insights from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we leverage CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and LSS data from the imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to study the distribution of gas around galaxy groups at low redshift, $z \approx 0.3$, via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. In particular, we perform velocity-weighted stacking on the photometric Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) to isolate the monopole and quadrupole of the kSZ signal, orienting the stacked images along 2D filaments identified using the Hessian of the projected gravitational potential. We find a 7.2$\sigma$ detection in the monopole of the signal (i.e., the gas density profile) and a 4$\sigma$ detection in the quadrupole ($m = 2$), constituting the first measurement of the alignment between gas distribution and the cosmic web through the kSZ effect. As it is a linear probe of the local gas density, the kSZ has heightened sensitivity to the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is believed to house the majority of the ``missing baryons.'' Mapping out the gas density at low redshifts, as enabled by our measurements, is crucial for weak lensing surveys, for which the impact of baryons on small scales is a major impediment. We compare the anisotropic signal against two hydrodynamical simulations, TNG300-1 and Illustris, which have very different baryonic feedback prescriptions. We find that the anisotropic signal measured in the data is comparable but slightly larger and more extended compared with the simulations. This suggests that there is excess accretion and feedback taking place through the filaments, hinting at the possible presence of spin-filament alignment of the BGS objects.

 - **Abstract**
 In the Interstellar Medium (ISM), gas and dust evolve under magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. This produces dense, non-linear structures that then seed star formation. Observationally and theoretically, turbulence is quantified by summary statistics such as the 2-Point Correlation Function (2PCF) or its Fourier-space analog the power spectrum. These cannot capture the non-Gaussian correlations coming from turbulence's highly non-linear nature. We here for the first time apply the 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) to turbulence, measuring it on a large suite of MHD simulations that mirror, as well as currently possible, the conditions expected in the ISM. The 4PCF captures the dependence of correlations between quadruplets of density points on the geometry of the tetrahedron they form. Using a novel functionality added to the \textsc{sarabande} code specifically for this work, we isolate the purely non-Gaussian piece of the 4PCF. We then explore simulations with a range of pressures, $P$, and magnetic fields, $B$ (but without self-gravity); these are quantified by different sonic $(M_{\rm S})$ and Alfvénic $(M_{\rm A})$ Mach numbers. We show that the 4PCF has rich behavior that can in future be used as a diagnostic of ISM conditions. We also show that a large-scale coherent magnetic field leads to parity-odd modes of the 4PCF, a clean test of magnetic field coherence with observational ramifications. All our measurements of the 4PCF (10 $M_{\rm S}, M_{\rm A}$ combinations, 9 time-slices for each, 34 4PCF modes for each) are made public for the community to explore.

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic ray (CR) flux, as well as the hydrogen flux into the atmosphere of an exoplanet, can change the composition of the atmosphere. Here, we present the CR and hydrogen flux on top of the atmosphere. To do so, we have to study the 3D multifluid MHD structure of astrospheres. We discuss the shock structure of the stellar wind of LHS 1140 using four different models: HD and MHD single-fluid models, as well as multifluid models for both cases, including a neutral hydrogen flow from the interstellar medium. The CR flux in a multifluid model as well as the ionization rate in an exoplanetary atmosphere are also presented. The astrosphere is modeled using the 3D Cronos code, while the CR flux at LHS 1140 b is calculated using both a 1D and a 3D stochastic galactic CR modulation code. Finally, the atmospheric ionization and radiation dose is estimated using the AtRIS code. Results. It is shown that the 3D multifluid positions of the termination shock differ remarkably from those found in the 3D ideal-single fluid hydrodynamic case. CR fluxes computed using a 1D approach are completely different from those calculated using the 3D modulation code and show an essentially unmodulated spectrum at the exoplanet in question. Utilizing these spectra, ionization rates and radiation exposure within the atmosphere of LHS 1140 b are derived. The termination shock, astropause, and bow shock distances must be taken from the 3D multifluid MHD model to determine the CR fluxes correctly. Moreover, because of the tiny astrosphere, the exoplanet is submerged in the neutral hydrogen flow of the interstellar medium, which will influence the exoplanetary atmosphere. A 3D approach to Galactic\0 cosmic ray (GCR) modulation in astrospheres is also necessary to avoid unrealistic estimates of GCR intensities.

 - **Abstract**
 During their thermally pulsing phase, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars eject material that forms extended dusty envelopes. Visible polarimetric imaging found clumpy dust clouds within two stellar radii of several oxygen-rich stars. Inhomogeneous molecular gas has also been observed in multiple emission lines within several stellar radii of different oxygen rich stars, including W Hya and Mira. At the stellar surface level, infrared images have revealed intricate structures around the carbon semi-regular variable R Scl and in the S-type star $\pi^{\mathrm{1}}$ Gru. Infrared images have also shown clumpy dust structures within a few stellar radii of the prototypical carbon AGB star IRC+10216, and studies of the molecular gas distribution beyond the dust formation zone have also shown complex circumstellar structures. Because of the lack of sufficient spatial resolution, however, the distribution of molecular gas in the stellar atmosphere and the dust formation zone of AGB carbon stars is not known, nor is how it is subsequently expelled. Here we report observations with a resolution of one stellar radius of the recently formed dust and molecular gas in the atmosphere of IRC+10216. Lines of HCN, SiS, and SiC$_2$ appear at different radii and in different clumps, which we interpret as large convective cells in the photosphere, as seen in Betelgeuse. The convective cells coalesce with pulsation causing anisotropies that, together with companions, shape its circumstellar envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 The giant molecular cloud complex Sagittarius B2 (Sgr~B2) in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy hosts several high-mass star formation sites, with Sgr~B2(M) and Sgr~B2(N) being the main centers of activity. This analysis aims to comprehensively model each core spectrum, considering molecular lines, dust attenuation, and free-free emission interactions. We describe the molecular content analysis of each hot core and identify the chemical composition of detected sources. Using ALMA's high sensitivity, we aim to characterize the hot core population in Sgr~B2(M) and N, gaining a better understanding of the different evolutionary phases of star formation processes in this complex. We conducted an unbiased ALMA spectral line survey of 47 sources in band 6 (211-275 GHz). Chemical composition and column densities were derived using XCLASS, assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium. Quantitative descriptions for each molecule were determined, considering all emission and absorption features across the spectral range. Temperature and velocity distributions were analyzed, and derived abundances were compared with other spectral line surveys. We identified 65 isotopologs from 48 different molecules, ranging from light molecules to complex organic compounds, originating from various environments. Most sources in the Sgr~B2 complex were assigned different evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation. Sgr~B2(N) hot cores show more complex molecules such as CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, while M cores contain lighter molecules such as SO$_2$, SO, and NO. Some sulfur-bearing molecules are more abundant in N than in M. The derived molecular abundances can be used for comparison and to constrain astrochemical models. Inner sources in both regions were generally more developed than outer sources, with some exceptions.
#### The puzzling long GRB 191019A: Evidence for Kilonova Light

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 191019A was a long Gamma-ray burst (GRB) lasting about 65 s and, as such, originally thought to be linked to a core-collapse supernova. However, even though follow-up observations identified the optical counterpart close to the bright nucleus of a nearby ancient galaxy (z=0.248), no associated supernova was found. This led to the suggestion that the burst was caused by the merger of two compact stellar objects, likely in a dense circumnuclear environment. By using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on prompt emission temporal properties, we noticed that GRB 191019A falls among those long GRBs which are associated with compact mergers and with evidence of kilonova light. We thus re-analyzed unpublished GROND multi-color (g'r'i'z'JHK_s) data obtained between 0.4 and 15 days post trigger. Image subtraction confirmed the optical counterpart in all four optical bands, with GROND tracking its fading until 1.5 days post-burst. Incorporating publicly available Swift-XRT data, a joint fit of an afterglow plus a kilonova model revealed a better match than an afterglow-only scenario. The resulting kilonova properties resemble those of AT2017gfo associated with the binary neutron star merger GW170817, with a total ejected mass of about 0.06 solar mass. Contrary to previous findings inferring a high-density circumburst environment (n0=10^7-10^8 cm^-3), our analysis finds standard conditions (n0 = 1 cm^-3), suggesting the long duration of GRB 191019A was intrinsic rather than due to jet interaction with a dense external medium.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, optical observations of the nova V5584 Sgr are presented. These observations cover different phases including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II, and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, which are subsequently observed in complete emission. The presence of numerous Fe II lines and low ejecta velocity aligns with the Fe II type nova classification. From optical and NIR colors it is clear that this nova manifests dust formation in the ejecta. The dust temperature and mass were estimated from a spectral energy distribution (SED) fit to the JHK band magnitudes and the WISE data. Light curve analysis shows t$_2$ and t$_3$ values of $\sim$ 26 and $\sim$ 48 days, classifying the nova as moderately fast. The physical and chemical properties during early decline and later phases were evaluated using the photoionization code CLOUDY. The best-fit model parameters from two epochs of multiwavelength spectra are compatible with a hot white dwarf source with a roughly constant luminosity of $\sim$ (2.08 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times$ 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find an ejected mass of $\sim$ (1.59 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$. Abundance analysis indicates that the ejecta is significantly enriched relative to solar values, with O/H = 30.2, C/H = 10.8, He/H = 1.8, Mg/H = 1.68, Na/H = 1.55, and N/H = 45.5 in the early decline phase, and O/H = 4.5, Ne/H = 1.5, and N/H = 24.5 in the nebular phase.
#### Journey to the center of the common envelope evolution. Inner dynamics of the post-dynamical inspiral

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of common envelope evolution are often terminated soon after the initial dynamical plunge of the companion transitions into a long-lasting post-dynamical inspiral with slowly varying semi-major axis, $a_\text{b}$. This premature termination is often due to insufficient numerical resolution and challenges associated with the softening of the gravitational potential of the two cores. In this work, we use statically-refined 3D hydrodynamical simulations to study binaries orbiting inside a common envelope, exploring the effects of varying numerical resolution, $\delta$, gravitational potential softening prescriptions, and the associated softening lengthscale, $\epsilon$. We find that quantities such as the binary inspiral timescale or the volume-averaged shearing rate typically converge to asymptotic values only for $\epsilon \le 0.1 a_\text{b}$ and $\delta \le 6 \times 10^{-3}a_\text{b}$ with smaller $\epsilon$ requiring correspondingly smaller $\delta$. After a few tens of binary orbits, the two cores become surrounded by a corotating, nearly hydrostatic gas structure, resembling the shared envelope of a contact binary. We propose that this structure is responsible for the slowing down of the dynamical inspiral, leading to an asymptotic inspiral timescale of approximately $10^5$ orbital periods for a binary mass ratio $q=1/3$, and approximately $10^6$ orbital periods for a binary mass ratio $q=1$. By investigating kinetic helicity, we argue that the magnetic field is unlikely to organize into large-scale structures via the usual $\alpha$--effect during the post-dynamical phase. Even in the absence of magnetic fields, we observe intermittent polar outflows collimated by partially centrifugally evacuated polar funnels. (abridged)
#### Uniting the Observed Dynamical Dark Energy Preference with the Discrepancies in $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ Across Cosmological Probes

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) indicate 1) potentially discrepant measurements of the matter density $\Omega_m$ and Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in a $\Lambda$CDM model when data are analyzed individually, and 2) hints of dynamical dark energy in a $w_0w_a$CDM model when data are combined in a joint analysis. We examine whether underlying dynamical dark energy cosmologies favored by real data would result in biases in $\Omega_m$ and $ H_0 $ for each probe when analyzed individually in a $\Lambda$CDM framework. We generate mock datasets in $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies, fit the individual probes under the $\Lambda$CDM model, and find that expected biases in $\Omega_m$ are $\sim 0.03$. Notably, the $\Omega_m$ differences between probes are consistent with the values observed in the real datasets. We also observe that mock DESI BAO datasets generated in the $ w_0w_a $CDM cosmologies will lead to a biased measurement of $ H_0 $ higher by ($\sim1.2$km/s/Mpc) when fitted under $\Lambda$CDM, appearing to mildly improve the Hubble tension, but as the true underlying $H_0$ is lower, the tension is in fact worsened. We find that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancies, the high BAO $ H_0 $ relative to CMB, and the joint dynamical dark energy signal itself are all related effects that could be explained simultaneously with either new physics or new systematics. While we find it is possible to unite many of the discrepancies seen in recent analyses along a single axis, our results underscore the importance of understanding systematic differences in datasets, as they have unique impacts in different cosmological parameter spaces.
