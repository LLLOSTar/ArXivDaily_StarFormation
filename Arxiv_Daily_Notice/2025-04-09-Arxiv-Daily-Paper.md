 - **Abstract**
 Stellar rotation and magnetic activity have a complex evolution that reveals multiple regimes. One of the related transitions that is seen in the rotation distribution for main-sequence (MS) solar-like stars has been attributed to core-envelope coupling and the consequent angular-momentum transfer between a fast core and a slow envelope. This feature is known as spin-down stalling and is related to the intermediate-rotation gap seen in field stars. Beyond this rotation signature, we search for evidence of it in stellar magnetic activity. We investigated the magnetic activity of the 1 Gyr old NGC 6811, a Kepler-field cluster, and Kepler MS stars of different ages. The magnetic activity was measured through the photometric magnetic activity proxy, Sph. To characterize the evolution of the magnetic activity for the Kepler sample, we split it according to the relative rotation and computed the respective activity sequences. We found the signature of core-envelope coupling in the magnetic activity of NGC 6811 and in the Kepler MS sample. In NGC 6811, we found enhanced magnetic activity for a range of effective temperatures that remained for significant timescales. In the Kepler sample, the magnetic activity sequences pile up in two distinct regions: at high activity levels that coincide with stars near the stalling mentioned above, where a behavior inversion is observed (slowly rotating stars have higher activity levels than fast-rotating stars, which is opposite to the overall behavior); and at low activity levels corresponding to slow rotators close to the detection limit, potentially facing a weakening of the magnetic braking. These results support the recent proposition that the strong shear experienced by stars during the core-envelope coupling phase can cause enhanced activity. This study helps us to shed light on the interplay between rotation, magnetic activity, and their evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H-alpha, and possibly Pa-alpha, using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks. The physical scale of the slope change occurs at ~120 pc and ~170 pc for these two transitions, respectively. A radial dependence in the shape of the H-alpha PS also suggests that the length scale drops from ~180 pc at 5 kpc, to ~90 pc at 2 kpc, to ~25 pc in the central ~kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions. The corresponding emission measure is ~100 times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of young stars and planet-forming environments is intrinsically linked to their nascent surroundings. This is particularly evident for FU Orionis (FUor) objects$-$a class of young protostars known for dramatic outbursts resulting in significant increases in brightness. We present a case study of V960 Mon, an FUor that has recently been found to show signs of a fragmenting spiral arm, potentially connected to planet formation. Our study explores the large-scale environment ($10^3-10^4$ au) and incorporates ALMA band 3, band 4 and band 6 continuum data, molecular emissions from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SiO, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$ and DCN, alongside optical and near-infrared observations from VLT/MUSE and VLT/SPHERE. We map a region of 20" across where we find tantalizing emissions that provide a unique view of a young group of protostars, including the discovery of a class-0 protostar to the east of the FUor. The $^{12}$CO and SiO tracers suggest that this object is at the base of an outflow, potentially impacting the surrounding medium. The MUSE and SPHERE observations indicate the presence of an elongated feature towards a prominent source to the southeast that may represent interaction between V960 Mon and its surrounding. Moreover, the C$^{18}$O emission overlaps with the clumps of the detected fragmenting spiral arm. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a connection between infalling material, fragmentation, and the intensity outburst of a protostar. Our case study highlights the complex interactions between young stars and their surroundings that drive the evolution of the planet forming environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* provide a means of constraining parameters of both the black hole and its surrounding plasma. However, intrinsic variability of the emitting material introduces a major source of systematic uncertainty, complicating parameter inference. The precise origin and structure of this variability remain uncertain, and previous studies have largely relied on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to estimate its effects. Here, we fit a semi-analytic, dual-cone model of the emitting plasma to multiple years of EHT observations to empirically assess the impact of intrinsic variability and improved array coverage on key measurements including the black hole mass-to-distance ratio, spin, and viewing inclination. Despite substantial differences in the images of the two epochs, we find that the inferred mass-to-distance ratio remains stable and mutually consistent. The black hole spin is unconstrained for both observations, despite the improved baseline coverage in 2018. The inferred position angle and inclination of the black hole spin axis are discrepant between the two years, suggesting that variability and model misspecification contribute significantly to the total error budget for these quantities. Our findings highlight both the promise and challenges of multi-epoch EHT observations: while they can refine parameter constraints, they also reveal the limitations of simple parametric models in capturing the full complexity of the source. Our analysis -- the first to fit semi-analytic emission models to 2018 EHT observations -- underscores the importance of systematic uncertainty quantification from intrinsic variability in future high-resolution imaging studies of black hole environments and the role of repeated observations in quantifying these uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 A stellar mass black hole (BH) is believed to be formed as the result of the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its evolution. For a class of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it is widely believed that their centre engines are just these stellar-mass BHs, which accrete the collapsing matter in hyper-accretion mode. In such systems, a popular scenario is that the magnetic field supported in the accretion disk extracts the rotational energy of the spinning BH and launch a jet on one hand, and the accretion of the infalling matter of the collapse will increase the BH's rotational energy on the other hand. However, the detailed physical processes of the above scenario are still not well understood. Here we report that when the accretion process is dominated by a Magnetically-Arrested-Disk (MAD), the above mentioned two competing processes link to each other, so that the spin evolution of the BH can be written in a simple form. Most interestingly, when the total accreted mass is enough, the BH spin will always reach to an equilibrium value peaked at $\chi\sim0.88$. This value does not depend on the initial mass and spin of the BH, as well as the history of accretion. This model predicts that there is a population of stellar-mass BH which possess a universal spin at the end of the collapsing accretion. We test this prediction against the 3rd gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-3) and found that the distribution of the spin of the secondary BH is centred narrowly around $0.85\pm 0.05$ as predicted. Applying this model to the parameters of observed parameters in GWTC-3 and further GW catalogues, it is possible to infer the initial mass and spin distributions of the binary BHs detected with GW.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of multiple molecular spectral lines in gas infalling sources can provide the physical and chemical properties of these sources and help us estimate their evolutionary stages. We report line detections within the 3 mm band using the FTS wide-sideband mode of the IRAM 30 m telescope toward 20 gas-infalling sources. Using XCLASS, we identify the emission lines of up to 22 molecular species (including a few isotopologues) and one hydrogen radio recombination line in these sources. H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CCH lines are detected in 15 sources. We estimate the rotation temperatures and column densities of these molecular species using the LTE radiative transfer model, and compare the molecular abundances of these sources with those from nine high-mass star-forming regions reported in previous studies and with those from the chemical model. Our results suggest that G012.79-0.20, G012.87-0.22 clump A and B, and G012.96-0.23 clump A may be in the high-mass protostellar object stage, while sources with fewer detected species may be in the earlier evolutionary stage. Additionally, the CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ column densities in our sources reveal a linear correlation, with a ratio of N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) = 89.2$\pm$5.6, which is higher than the ratios reported in the literature. When considering only sources with lower column densities, this ratio decreases to 29.0$\pm$6.1, consistent with those of diffuse clouds. Furthermore, a comparison between the N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) ratio and the sources' physical parameters reveals a correlation, with sources exhibiting higher ratios tending to have higher kinetic temperatures and H$_2$ column densities.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the neutrino magnetic moment (NMM,$\mu_v$) is one of the most significant challenges in physics. The additional energy loss due to NMM can significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the MESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He core mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical $Z = 1 Z_{\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\odot}$, and $\mu_v = 3 \times 10^{-12} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\sim 5\%$, and the TRGB luminosity increases by $\sim 35\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However, contrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs earlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the additional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core, releases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the hydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass faster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak luminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and sub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency. We found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash can induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot region into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in NMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter the surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment effect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW mixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to effectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of Cyg X-1, utilizing archival high-resolution UV and optical spectra in conjunction with sophisticated atmospheric models. Notably, this is the first investigation to simultaneously analyze UV and optical spectra of Cyg X-1 along with incorporating X-rays to constrain the stellar and wind parameters. Our analysis yields notably lower masses for both the donor (29$\,M_\odot$) and the black hole (12.7 to 17.8$\,M_\odot$, depending on inclination), and confirms that the donor's radius is close to reaching the inner Lagrangian point. We find super-solar Fe, Si, and Mg abundances (1.3-1.8 times solar) at the surface of the donor star, while the total CNO abundance remains solar despite evidence of CNO processing (N enrichment, O depletion) and He enrichment. This abundance pattern is distinct from the surrounding Cyg OB3 association. We observe a clear difference in wind parameters between X-ray states: $v_\infty \approx 1200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M} \approx 3\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the high/soft state, increasing to $v_\infty\lesssim 1800\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $\dot{M}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the low/hard state. The observed X-ray luminosity is consistent with wind-fed accretion. Evolutionary models show that Cyg X-1 will undergo Roche lobe overflow in the near future. Under a fully conservative mass accretion scenario, our models predict a future binary black hole merger for Cyg X-1 within $\sim5$ Gyr. Our comprehensive analysis provides refined stellar and wind parameters of the donor star in Cyg X-1, highlighting the importance of using advanced atmospheric models and considering X-ray ionization and wind clumping. The observed abundances suggest a complex formation history involving a high initial metallicity.
#### Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs). XXIII. The powering mechanisms of the Ly$α$ haloes around high-$z$ quasars probed by slit spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present the analysis of Ly$\alpha$ haloes around faint quasars at $z\sim4$ and $z\sim6$. We use 20 and 162 quasars at $z\sim4$ and $z\sim6$, taken by slit spectroscopy, and detect Ly$\alpha$ haloes around 12 and 26 of these quasars, respectively. The average absolute magnitudes of the detected quasars are $\langle M_{1450} \rangle = -23.84$ mag at $z\sim4$ and $\langle M_{1450} \rangle = -23.68$ mag at $z\sim6$, which are comparable at $z\sim4$ and 3 mag fainter at $z\sim6$ than those of previous studies. The median surface brightness profiles are found to be consistent with an exponential curve, showing a hint of flattening within a radius of 5 kpc. The Ly$\alpha$ haloes around these faint quasars are systematically fainter than those around bright quasars in the previous studies. We confirm the previous results that the Ly$\alpha$ halo luminosity depends on both the ionizing and Ly$\alpha$ peak luminosities of quasars at $z\sim4$, and also find that a similar correlation holds even at $z\sim6$. While the observed Ly$\alpha$ halo luminosity is overall attributed to recombination emission from the optically thin gas clouds in the CGM, its luminosity dependences can be consistently explained by the partial contributions of recombination radiation from the optically thick clouds, which is thought to originate from the CGM centre, and the scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons, which is resonantly trapped at the CGM centre and escaping outside of the haloes.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the form of prebiotic molecules are potentially building blocks of life. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations in spectral scanning mode, we carried out a deep search for COMs within the disk of V883 Ori, covering frequency ranges of $\sim$ 348 - 366 GHz. V883 Ori is an FUor object currently undergoing an accretion burst, which increases its luminosity and consequently increases the temperature of the surrounding protoplanetary disk, facilitating the detection of COMs in the gas phase. We identified 26 molecules, including 14 COMs and 12 other molecules, with first detection in this source of the molecules: CH3OD, H2C17O, and H213CO. We searched for multiple nitrogen-bearing COMs, as CH3CN had been the only nitrogen-bearing COM that has been identified so far in this source. We also detected CH3CN, and tentatively detect CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3OCN, CH3NCO, and NH2CHO. We compared the abundances relative to CH3OH with those in the handful of objects with previous detections of these species: the Class 0 protostars IRAS 16293-2422 A, IRAS 16293-2422 B and B1-c, the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (North), the Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the protoplanetary disk of Oph-IRS 48. We report $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher abundances compared to Class 0 protostars and $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower abundances compared to the protoplanetary disk, Sagittarius B2 (North), and 67P/C-G. These results indicate that the protoplanetary disk phase could contribute to build up of COMs.
#### Investigating an Erupting Metric-decimetric Radio Depression and its Physical Origin

 - **Abstract**
 We present direct metric-decimetric radio imaging observations of a fascinating quiescent filament eruption on 2024 March 17 using data from the DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART), with a combination of the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Chinese Ha Solar Explorer. At the radio band, even though the filament is difficult to identify in its early phase, it rapidly became distinct and formed a continuous loop-like dark structure during the eruption, i.e., so-called radio depression. Compared with the fragmentation of the erupting filament observed at the Ha and EUV bands, the radio depression appeared more coherently. Based on synthetic radio images from a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of a flux-rope-filament eruption, it is suggested that the radio depression originates from the absorption of cold and dense materials within the erupting flux rope to the background emission. The absorption seems to be stronger than that at the Ha and EUV bands, thus leading to their apparent discrepancies. Moreover, the radio depression is also found to occupy the lower part but not the whole body of the flux rope.
#### Investigating Embedded Structures and Gas Kinematics in the IRDC Hosting Bubble N59-North

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength study of an extended area hosting the bubble N59-North to explore the physical processes driving massive star formation (MSF). The Spitzer 8 $\mu$m image reveals an elongated/filamentary infrared-dark cloud (length $\sim$28 pc) associated with N59-North, which contains several protostars and seven ATLASGAL dust clumps at the same distance. The existence of this filament is confirmed through $^{13}$CO and NH$_3$ molecular line data in a velocity range of [95, 106] km s$^{-1}$. All dust clumps satisfy Kauffmann & Pillai's condition for MSF. Using Spitzer 8 $\mu$m image, a new embedded hub-filament system candidate (C-HFS) is investigated toward the ATLASGAL clump, located near the filament's central region. MeerKAT 1.3 GHz continuum emission, detected for the first time toward C-HFS, reveals an ultracompact HII region driven by a B2-type star, suggesting an early stage of HFS with minimal feedback from the young massive star. The comparison of the position-velocity (PV) and position-position-velocity (PPV) diagrams with existing theoretical models suggests that rotation, central collapse, and end-dominated collapse are not responsible for the observed gas motion in the filament. The PPV diagram indicates the expansion of N59-North by revealing blue- and red-shifted gas velocities at the edge of the bubble. Based on comparisons with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, this study suggests that cloud-cloud collision (CCC) led to the formation of the filament, likely giving it a conical structure with gas converging toward its central region, where C-HFS is located. Overall, the study supports multi-scale filamentary mass accretion for MSF, likely triggered by CCC.
#### SOFIA/upGREAT imaging spectroscopy of the [C II] 158 um fine structure line toward the Sgr A region in the Galactic center

 - **Abstract**
 We present SOFIA/upGREAT velocity-resolved spectral imaging and analysis of the 158 um [C II] spectral line toward the central 80 by 43\,pc region of the Central Molecular Zone of the Galaxy. The field we imaged with 14" (0.6 pc) spatial and 1 km/s spectral resolution contains the Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND) around the central black hole Sgr A*, the neighboring thermal Arched Filaments, the nonthermal filaments of the Radio Arc, and the three luminous central star clusters. [C II] traces emission from the CND's inner edge to material orbiting at a distance of approximately 6 pc. Its velocity field reveals no sign of inflowing material nor interaction with winds from the Sgr A East supernova remnant. Wide-field imaging of the Sgr A region shows multiple circular segments, including the thermal Arched Filaments, that are centered on a region that includes the Quintuplet cluster. We examine the possibility that the Arched Filaments and other large-scale arcs trace transient excitation events from supernova blast waves. Along the Arched Filaments, comparisons among far-IR fine structure lines show changes in ionization state over small scales and that high-excitation lines are systematically shifted in position from the other lines. These also point to transient fast winds that shocked on the surface of the Arches cloud to produce additional local UV radiation to excite the Arched Filaments on a cloud surface illuminated by UV from hot stars.
