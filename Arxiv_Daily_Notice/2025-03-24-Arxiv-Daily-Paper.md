 - **Abstract**
 The sub-Neptune planets have no solar system analogues, and their low bulk densities suggest thick atmospheres containing degenerate quantities of volatiles and H/He, surrounding cores of unknown sizes. Measurements of their atmospheric composition can help break these degeneracies, but many previous studies at low spectral resolution have largely been hindered by clouds or hazes, returning muted spectra. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of a short-period sub-Neptune using ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the cores of spectral lines that can extend above potential high altitude aerosol layers. We observe four CRIRES+ $\textit{K}$-band transits of the warm sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b (T$_{\text{eq}}$ = 693$\pm$18 K) which orbits an M2V host star. Despite the high quality data and sensitivity to CH$_4$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$, and H$_2$S, we detect no molecular species. Injection-recovery tests are consistent with two degenerate scenarios. First, GJ 3090 b may host a highly metal-enriched atmosphere with $>\,$150 Z$_{\odot}$ and mean molecular weight $>\,$7.1 g mol$^{-1}$, representing a volatile dominated envelope with a H/He mass fraction $x_{\text{H/He}} < 33\%$, and an unconstrained aerosol layer. Second, the data are consistent with a high altitude cloud or haze layer at pressures $<\,$3.3$\times$10$^{-5}~$bar, for any metallicity. GJ 3090 b joins the growing evidence to suggest that high metallicity atmospheres and high altitude aerosol layers are common within the warm (500$~<T_{\text{eq}}<~$800 K) sub-Neptune population. We discuss the observational challenges posed by the M-dwarf host star, and suggest observing strategies for transmission spectroscopy of challenging targets around M-dwarfs for existing and ELT instrumentation.

 - **Abstract**
 The physico-chemical properties of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 3242 are investigated in both 1D and 2D, using Integral Field Unit (IFU) data. This PN has a complex morphology with multiple shells and contains a pair of structures with a lower degree of ionization compared to the main nebular components. These structures are known as low ionization structures (LISs), and their origin is still a mystery. With the capabilities provided by IFU spectroscopy, we aim to gain a better understanding of the behavior of nebular properties in the LISs. Data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) were used in order to perform a spatially resolved physico-chemical analysis of NGC 3242 both in 2D, through the analysis of emission line maps, and in 1D, simulating long-slit spectroscopy, with pseudo-slits. Through the deeper investigation of MUSE data, we detect new structures perpendicular to the pair of LISs of NGC 3242, which are mainly seen in the light of [S III] and [N II]. In addition, two arc-like structures are revealed. Moreover, an inner jet-like structure is found through its [Fe III] emission. The interaction of the jet with the rim may be related to the formation of knots and blobs. The higher value of Te, is estimated from the [S III] diagnostic lines, followed by Te ([N II]), Te(H I) and finally Te (He I). In all cases, Te is higher at the inner nebular structures. Regarding electron density, ne, is lower at the LISs, while an increase is observed at the nebular rim. Diagnostic diagrams confirm that NGC 3242 is a highly ionized nebula. Moreover, the MUSE data unveiled for the first time in this PN, the atomic line [C I] {\lambda}8727, primarily emitted from the LISs. This finding suggests that these structures may consist of a molecular core surrounded by neutral and ionized gas

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decades, observational evidence of circumstellar disks around massive protostars has been steadily accumulating. However, there have also been cases of non-detections in high-mass star-forming regions, leaving the role and prevalence of disks around massive protostars still uncertain. We used high-resolution (0.2") NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations to study the 1.3 mm continuum and molecular line emission of five massive dense cores in the Cygnus-X cloud complex. Four cores host 2000-au-scale rotating structures previously identified as disk candidates in lower-resolution SMA observations, while the remaining core with no evidence for a disk serves as a comparison. With a resolution of 300 au, the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals varying levels of fragmentation in our sample, with fragment radii ranging from 150 to 800 AU. In this work, we confirm the existence of two small, stable disks in Keplerian-like rotation at scales of 500 au out of four previously identified disk candidates from the SMA observations at coarser resolution. The lack of evidence for Keplerian disks in other disk candidates identified from the SMA data suggests that rotational signatures observed at 2000 au scales do not necessarily imply the presence of Keplerian disks at smaller scales. Therefore, higher-resolution and higher-sensitivity observations are essential to definitively identify Keplerian disks on smaller scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Unstable states of the solar coronal magnetic field structure result in various flare behaviors. In this study, we compared the confined and eruptive flares that occurred under similar magnetic circumstances in the active region 12673, on 2017 September 6, using the twist number, decay index, and height of magnetic field lines to identify observational behaviors of the flare eruption. We investigated the parameters from the magnetic field lines involved in an initial energy release, which were identified from the positions of the core of flare ribbons, i.e., flare kernels. The magnetic field lines were derived by nonlinear force-free field modeling calculated from the photospheric vector magnetic field obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, and flare kernels were identified from the 1600 angstrom data obtained by the SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. The twist number of all the magnetic field lines in the confined flare was below 0.6; however, the twist number in seven out of twenty-four magnetic field lines in the eruptive flare was greater than 0.6. These lines were tall. It is found that the decay index is not a clear discriminator of the confined and eruptive flares. Our study suggests that some magnetic field lines in the kink instability state may be important for eruptive flares, and that taller magnetic field lines may promote flare eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 Sound speed can be an important tool in unraveling the nature of matter that exists at the cores of neutron stars. In this study, we investigate three major classes of equations of state; monotonous, non-monotonous and discontinuous depending on the nature of the sound speed in neutron stars. The monotonous EoS refers to hadronic models, the non-monotonous refers to the quarkyonic or smooth crossover models and discontinuous refers to discontinuous first-order phase transition models. We generate a large ensemble of EoS for three classes with the model agnostic speed of sound interpolation approach. Our main aim is to check which class of EoS is most favoured by present astrophysical bounds. It is seen that although non-monotonous and discontinuous is favoured thermodynamically, the usual neutron star observations like mass-radius, and f-mode oscillation fail to provide a satisfactory result. The universal relations are also seen to be futile as they show considerable spread and significant overlaps among the different classes. The Bayesian analysis shows slight bias towards the non-monotonous model but fails to provide a decisive answer.

 - **Abstract**
 Three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations are performed to investigate properties of the downstream turbulence generated by the interaction between a relativistic shock wave and multiple clumps. We analyze the properties of the downstream turbulence by performing the Helmholtz decomposition. It is shown that, in contrast to the non-relativistic shock case, the amplitude of compressive modes is comparable to that of solenoidal modes for the relativistic shock. In addition, many reflected shocks propagate in the downstream region. The strength of the compressive mode, the solenoidal mode, the reflected shock waves, and the amplified magnetic field depend on the amplitude of the upstream density fluctuations. Our simulation results suggest that the wide distribution of the ratio of the magnetic energy to the shock kinetic energy, $\epsilon_B$, in gamma-ray burst afterglows is due to the diversity of the gamma-ray burst environment. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity of density around high-energy astrophysical objects affects the spectrum of accelerated particles because the reflected shock and turbulence can inject and accelerate non-thermal particles in the shock downstream region. The probability distribution of the downstream quantities, power spectra of turbulence, and vortex generation are also analyzed and discussed in this work.
#### External tides: an important driver of velocity dispersion in molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 Using the 3D density distribution derived from the 3D dust map of the solar neighborhood, the gravitational potential is obtained by solving the Poisson equation, from which the tidal tensor is computed. In the optimal decomposition, the external tidal tensor follows the same formalism as that of a point mass. The average tidal strength of the clouds, derived from both tidal tensor analysis and pixel-by-pixel computation, shows consistent results. The equivalent velocity dispersion of the clouds, estimated from the average tidal strength, is comparable in magnitude to the velocity dispersion measured from CO (1-0) line emission. This suggests that tidal effects from surrounding material may play a significant role in driving velocity dispersion within the clouds. Future studies should carefully consider these tidal effects in star-forming regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Historically, various methods have been employed to understand the origin of the elements, including observations of elemental abundances which have been compared to Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. It is also well known that 1D Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) measurements fail to accurately capture elemental abundances. Non-LTE (NLTE) effects may play a significant role, and neglecting them leads to erroneous implications in galaxy modelling. In this paper, we calculate 3D NLTE abundances of seven key iron-peak and neutron-capture elements (Mn, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, Eu) based on carefully assembled 1D LTE literature measurements, and investigate their impact within the context of the OMEGA+ GCE model. Our findings reveal that 3D NLTE abundances are significantly higher for iron-peak elements at [Fe/H]< -3, with (for the first time ever) [Ni/Fe] and (confirming previous studies) [Co/Fe] on average reaching 0.6-0.8 dex, and [Mn/Fe] reaching -0.1 dex, which current 1D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models cannot explain. We also observe a slightly higher production of neutron-capture elements at low metallicities, with 3D NLTE abundances of Eu being higher by +0.2 dex at [Fe/H]= -3. 3D effects are most significant for iron-peak elements in the very metal-poor regime, with average differences between 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE {reaching} up to 0.15 dex. Thus, ignoring 3D NLTE effects introduces significant biases, so including {them} should be considered whenever possible.
#### Collapse of Rotating White Dwarfs and Multimessenger Signals

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of numerical relativity simulations of core collapse of rotating magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) in three dimension, aiming at discussing the explosion dynamics and associate multi-messenger signals: gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos, and electromagnetic counterparts. All WDs initiate gravitational collapse due to electron captures and then experience prompt type explosions after the proto neutron star formation. We observe the explosions dominated by a bipolar structure and the emergence of strong spiral waves in rapidly rotating models. The spiral waves facilitate to increase both the explosion energy and ejecta mass, though the final values still fall in the category of low explosion energy supernovae with small ejecta mass. The spiral waves also produce strong GWs, which may expand the horizon distance of such events against GWs up to $\sim 10$ Mpc for third-generation ground-based detectors. Additionally as an intriguing implication, we demonstrate that such accretion or merger induced collapse of WDs might be able to explain some of the rapidly evolving optical transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), as previously suggested. Based on the simulation results together with several assumptions, we confirm that the magnetar may account for the brighter side of observed FBOTs, while a combination of ejecta-envelope interaction which can be also followed by radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized along with the explosion might still explain the fainter branch even in the absence of magnetar formation.
#### Tidal Amplitudes in the Magellanic Cloud Population of Heartbeat Stars

 - **Abstract**
 Heartbeat (HB) stars exhibit pulses in their light curves once per orbit due to ellipsoidal distortions from strong tides at periapse. We analyze the population of HB stars in the Magellanic Clouds captured by the OGLE survey, and provide broadband spectral energy distribution fitting to estimate physical properties of the HB stars. The HB stars span a wide range of luminosities, radii, and effective temperatures. However, we find that they cluster near loci of strong tidal influence at periapse, indicating that in nearly all cases, strong tides are indeed responsible for their photometric variability. HB stars tend to populate regions away from the main sequence, where stellar evolution is particularly rapid. We examine the distribution of tidal amplitudes, and show that these can be interpreted through a simplified model of radius growth through stellar evolution and orbital circularization through linear tidal dissipation. When we compare rates of tidal dissipation, we find differences between the modeled modified tidal quality factor among hot ($T_{\rm eff}>6250$~K), $Q_\ast' \gtrsim 10^7$, and cool ($T_{\rm eff}<6250$~K), $Q_\ast'\sim 10^5$, stars, which is qualitatively consistent with models of efficient tidal dissipation in the convective envelopes of cool stars. We find that this model can reproduce the observed observed locations and amplitudes of HB stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The hot stars, in particular, extend to amplitudes near, but not beyond, the threshold for nonlinear tidal wave breaking on stellar surfaces, suggesting a physical saturation of tidal amplitudes at this threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 Individually identified binary systems of very massive stars define fixed points on possible evolutionary pathways that begin with extreme star formation and end in either coalescence of compact remnants or complete disruption as pair-production supernovae. The LMC star Melnick 39 in the Tarantula Nebula is revealed to be an eccentric ($e = 0.618\pm0.014$) binary system of reasonably long period from time-series analysis of Chandra T-ReX X-ray observations. Its X-ray luminosity scales with the inverse of the binary separation, as expected for colliding-wind binaries in the adiabatic regime. The inclusion of optical time-series spectroscopy from the VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey and archival HST spectroscopy confirms Melnick 39 as a double-lined O2.5If/WN6+O3V-III spectroscopic binary with orbital period near 648 days. We obtain a mass ratio of $q = 0.76 \pm 0.06$, and minimum dynamical masses of $105\pm11$ and $80\pm11$ $M_{solar}$ for the O2.5If/WN6 and O3V-III components, plus photometric evidence for an orbital inclination near 90 degrees. Disentangled spectroscopy allows the physical and wind properties of the primary to be determined, including $T_{\ast}$ = 44 kK, $\log L/L_{solar}$ = 6.2, $\log \dot{M}/M_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ = $-5.0$. Its dynamical mass agrees closely with $109 M_{solar}$ obtained from the mass-luminosity relation of very massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the first combined detections of CO$_2$, CO, XCN and water ices beyond the local Universe. We find gas-phase CO in addition to the solid phase CO. Our source, SSTXFLS J172458.3+591545, is a $z=0.494$ star-forming galaxy which also hosts a deeply obscured AGN. The profiles of its ice features are consistent with those of other Galactic and local galaxy sources and the implied ice mantle composition is similar to that of even more obscured sources. The ice features indicate the presence of a compact nucleus in our galaxy and allow us to place constraints on its density and temperature ($n>10^5$cm$^{-3}$ and $T=20-90K$). We infer the visual extinction towards this nucleus to be $A_V\approx6-7$. An observed plot of $\tau_{Si}$ vs. $\tau_{CO2}/\tau_{Si}$ can be viewed as a probe for both the total dustiness of a system as well as the clumpiness of the dust along the line of sight. This paper highlights the potential of using {\sl JWST} MIRI spectra to study the dust composition and geometric distribution of sources beyond the local Universe.
#### On the manifest link between Terzan 5 and the Galactic bulge

 - **Abstract**
 We address the chemical link between Terzan 5 (hereafter Ter5) and the Bulge, as probed by the observed distributions of [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios with varying [Fe/H] and by suitable statistical tests to evaluate their significance. We also present a comprehensive review of the kinematic and evolutionary properties of Ter5, based on all the available observational signatures and the scenarios proposed so far in the literature for the formation and evolution of Ter5, based on these observational facts and the recent modeling of its star formation and chemical enrichment history. This analysis confirms the complex nature of this massive stellar system, with robust evidences of a bulge in-situ formation and of a subsequent evolution that cannot be simply explained by a single merging/accretion event of two globulars or a globular and a giant molecular cloud, as proposed in the literature, but it requires a more complex star formation likely accompanied by some self-enrichment.
#### Chronology of our Galaxy from Gaia CMD-fitting (ChronoGal): the early formation of the Milky Way disk and the impact of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus

 - **Abstract**
 The derivation of precise stellar ages is considered the current major challenge to reconstruct the chronology of the Milky Way. Color-magnitude diagram (CMD)-fitting offers a robust alternative to individual age determinations via the derivation of dynamically evolved star formation histories (deSFH) and age-metallicity distributions (Gallart et al. 2024). Our new suite of routines, this http URL, specifically developed to analyse Gaia CMDs, produce deSFHs which are robust against sensible changes in the input parameters and extremely precise, providing an unprecedentedly detailed characterization of the successive events of star formation that, since its early evolution, have shaped the current Milky Way. Also important is the fact that, thanks to the high completeness of the Gaia photometric data, this http URL provides the actual number of stars and the mass involved in the different events of star formation. The current analysis of the deSFH for stellar populations within 100 pc of the Sun, as well as for kinematically selected stars in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo, allows us to sketch a tentative picture of Milky Way evolution. The findings indicate that star formation commenced very early in a thick disk, with a small fraction of stars having [M/H]<-0.5 forming more than 12 Gyr ago. This phase culminated in a more prominent 12 Gyr old population with [M/H]~-0.5. Approximately 11 Gyr ago, the merger with GSE triggered an intense burst of star formation, generating most of the thick disk mass and enriching its metallicity to solar levels. Subsequently, the bulk of the star formation in the thin disk started and continues with a somewhat episodic behaviour up to the present time.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field, assuming it has such relicts that were magnetized after nebula dispersal via one of two distinct pathways: i. an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid and ii. a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. Field topology and orientation may thus reveal key details of the nature and history of (16) Psyche, and our framework is broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.
#### The impact of the Galactic bar and the Large Magellanic Cloud on hypervelocity star trajectories

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected from the Galactic Center (GC) at speeds faster than the Galactic escape velocity are useful tools to provide insight into the Milky Way's dark matter halo. However, most characterizations of HVS orbits assume static models of the Milky Way's gravitational potential. In this work, we assess the influence of the Galactic bar and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on HVS trajectories, comparing them with those from an axisymmetric potential. We simulate 28,000 HVSs ejected over the last 100 Myr and find that ignoring the bar and LMC can cause their apparent ejection location to drift by up to 100 pc. Applying two standard HVS potential fitting methods to our sample shows that they are unable to perform as designed when non-axisymmetric effects are neglected. We calculate the angle between HVS Galactocentric position and velocity and find the LMC and bar can induce a deflection angle of up to several degrees. Using mock Gaia Data Release 4 observations, however, we show that this deflection is too small in magnitude to be measured in the near future without significantly improved observational uncertainties, particularly in heliocentric distance. Our results emphasize the need to account for the bar and LMC in modeling the Galactic potential using HVSs as a tracer.
