 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the X-ray emission from the Galactic Centre (GC) region, focusing on the 6.4 keV fluorescent line of neutral or weakly ionised iron, which is commonly attributed to X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. Our goal is to separate the reflection signal from other physical X-ray components. We aim to produce a clean map of the 6.4 keV emission, thus providing a better understanding of the X-ray reflection processes in the GC. We utilised a deep mosaic of all available XMM-Newton observations, encompassing the central 40 square degrees of the Galaxy. The mosaics of two narrow bands centred at 6.7 keV and 6.4 keV, and a broader continuum band at lower energies (5-6.1 keV), provided valuable spatial and spectral information on the X-ray emission. These combined with the stellar mass distribution of our Galaxy enabled us to decompose the observed signal into physically meaningful components. Our analysis shows that the cleaned 6.4 keV band map, free from the contribution of bright and unresolved point sources, is predominantly shaped by X-ray reflection from dense molecular clouds. The spatial distribution of this emission, which strongly correlates with the molecular gas distribution in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), supports the interpretation that this map provides the best estimate of the X-ray reflection signal averaged over the last two decades. The cleaned reflection map produced could serve as a tool for future studies to quantify upper limits on the reflection contribution from low-energy cosmic rays in unilluminated regions. Moreover, we estimate that, on average within the CMZ, approximately 65% of the ridge emission contributes to the observed 6.4 keV emission, a factor that should be incorporated into upcoming investigations of the GC, such as polarisation studies of the reflected X-ray continuum from molecular clouds.
#### X-ray polarization in SN 1006 southwest shows spatial variations and differences with the radio band

 - **Abstract**
 We report the detection of a spatial variation of X-ray polarization in the southwestern shell of SN 1006 (SN 1006 SW) using IXPE. The shell has an average X-ray polarization degree (PD) of $21.6\%\pm 4.5\%$ and polarization angle (PA) of $-48^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ in the 2--4 keV energy band, similar to those in the northeastern shell. The PD varies along SN 1006 SW, with a peak PD$= 40\%\pm 8\%$ in the south and a significantly lower PD $\lesssim 27\%$ (99\% upper limit) in the west where the shell has been proposed to be interacting with an interstellar cloud. The correlation between the PD, which reflects the magnetic orderliness, and the preshock density provides observational evidence that magnetic turbulence and amplification are environment-dependent. The high PD detected in the southern region of the shell constrains the magnetic turbulence scale of $\lesssim 0.1$~pc. Moreover, by comparing the IXPE X-ray and MeerKAT radio polarization measurements for SN 1006 SW, we found that magnetic fields traced by X-ray polarization are nearly radially distributed, whereas those traced by radio polarization tend to follow a direction parallel to the Galactic plane. This suggests that the X-ray polarization probes freshly amplified magnetic fields from small-scale structures in the immediate postshock region, while the radio traces more extended regions influenced by the pre-existing ambient magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at $z=1.46$. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO ($J$=5--4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 $\pm$ 6\% of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at $8~\mu$m ($L_8$) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) $L_\mathrm{IR}$, inferred from the CO ($J$=5--4) map. The spatial profiles of the $L_\mathrm{IR}$ and $L_8$ are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR ($L_8$) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the $L_8$ to $L_\mathrm{IR}$ ratio for the first time at $z>1$, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently discovered spectroscopic binary $\rho$ Oph A is a rare magnetic hot binary system composed of two early B-type stars, comprising a non-magnetic primary (Aa) and a slightly less massive magnetic secondary (Ab). Using near-IR interferometry, we aim to resolve the system's astrometric orbit. The high-spectral resolution VLTI/GRAVITY data also enables obtaining further information about the two stellar components, and about the centrifugal magnetosphere orbiting the magnetic star. We obtained a time-series of $K$-band interferometric data from VLTI/GRAVITY, and analyzed them with the geometrical model-fitting tool PMOIRED. The continuum was used to derive the relative astrometry and relative fluxes of the two components, leading to the astrometric orbital solution. Spectro-interferometry covering the Br$\gamma$ line was then used to obtain high-angular-resolution information about the dominant magnetospheric cloud in corotation with the magnetic Ab component. The combination of the astrometric orbital solution with the published radial velocities for both components led to a 3-dimensional orbital solution, dynamical masses, and a dynamical parallax, revealing a good agreement with previous estimates and confirming the previously inferred alignment of the orbital axis and the rotation axis of the Ab component, albeit at a much higher precision. Detailed analysis of the Br$\gamma$ spectrointerferometry then revealed the changing position of the magnetospheric cloud relative to the Ab component. Comparison to the location of the cloud predicted from $\rho$ Oph Ab's oblique rotator model and H$\alpha$ emission properties demonstrated excellent agreement. We are additionally able to demonstrate that the magnetic star exhibits prograde rotation. This represents the first time that the motion of a centrifugal magnetosphere has been detected in angularly resolved observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical simulations predict that clumps ($\sim$1 pc) should form stars at high efficiency to produce bound star clusters. We conducted a statistical study of 17 nearby cluster-forming clumps to examine the star formation rate and gas mass surface density relations (i.e. $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ vs. $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$) at the clump scale. Using near-infrared point sources and Herschel dust continuum analysis, we obtained the radius, age, and stellar mass for most clusters in the ranges 0.5$-$1.6 pc, 0.5$-$1.5 Myr, 40$-$500 M$_\odot$, respectively, and also found that they are associated with $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$ values ranging from 80$-$600 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. We obtained the best-fit scaling relations as $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ $\propto$ $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}^{1.46}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ $\propto$ $(\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}/t_{\rm{ff}})^{0.80}$ for the studied sample of clumps. Comparing our results with existing scaling relations at cloud and extragalactic scales, we found that while the power-law exponent obtained in this work is similar to those found at these scales, the star formation rate surface densities are relatively higher for similar gas mass surface densities. From this work, we obtained instantaneous median star formation efficiency (SFE) and efficiency per free-fall time ($\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$) of $\sim$20% and $\sim$13%, respectively, for the studied clumps. We discuss the cause of the obtained high SFE and $\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$ in the studied clumps and also discuss the results in the context of bound cluster formation within molecular clouds. We conclude that our results do not favour a universal scaling law with a constant value of $\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$ in star-forming systems across different scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding exoplanet interiors is crucial for interpreting atmospheric observations and constraining their evolution and formation. However, due to limited observational constraints, interiors structures remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how new observational constraints, such as the Love number and atmospheric metallicity, improve our ability to characterize the interiors of hot Jupiters, planets for which Love number measurements are most feasible. We assess the precision required in Love number measurements to derive interior properties using both a simple two-layer homogeneous model and a more complex dilute core model. To account for observational uncertainties, we implement a retrieval framework. Our results show that accurately constraining core mass and bulk metallicity requires a high-precision Love number measurement, better than 40% for a homogeneous model and 15% for a dilute core model, along with an atmospheric metallicity measurement. We apply our retrieval framework to five planets with observed Love numbers, of which only WASP-19Ab has both an atmospheric metallicity constraint and a highly precise Love number measurement, with a precision of 12%. For this flagship planet, both models confirm the presence of a core, although we cannot yet distinguish between a compact core or diluted core. With the homogeneous model, we find a core mass fraction of $0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, corresponding to $79^{+21}_{-18}$ $M_\mathrm{earth}$. Upcoming JWST observations are expected to provide high-precision Love number measurements and precise atmospheric data, offering new insights into the structure and composition of gas giant interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 Early-type stars are key drivers of Galactic chemical evolution, enriching the interstellar medium with alpha elements through powerful stellar winds and core-collapse supernovae, fueled by their short lifetimes and high masses. However, their spectra remain challenging to analyse due to rapid rotation, weak metal lines, and non-LTE effects. While large spectroscopic surveys provide extensive low-resolution data, extracting reliable parameters remains difficult due to methodological limitations for hot stars. Our goal is to develop a unified framework combining data-driven and synthetic spectral approaches to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for hot stars using low-resolution spectra, addressing limitations in current methodologies while retaining critical spectral information. We present a hybrid approach integrating the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) and the Payne frameworks, for low-resolution ($R\sim 1800$) spectra from LAMOST DR9. Our method preserves full spectral information including Balmer series and metal-line blends, employing neural-network interpolation for efficient parameter estimation ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, and $v\sin i$) and abundance determination for O, Mg, Si, and Fe, across 8000 - 20000 K. We derive stellar parameters and abundances for 315,822 stars with $\mathrm{SNR} \geqslant 10$ in the $r$-band. Additionally, we detect abundance trends ([$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]) that exhibit temperature-dependent systematics and a distinct $\alpha$-poor stellar population within $0.0 \leqslant \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leqslant 0.5$ dex. The radial abundance gradients are negative and consistent with that derived from Cepheids, with a slope of $-0.070\pm0.007$ in \feh in the region $6 \leqslant R_\mathrm{GC}\leqslant 15$ kpc.

 - **Abstract**
 In the context of a new systematic study of the properties of the most compact and massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), here we present the determination of the chronological age, the structural parameters, and the dynamical age of NGC 1754. We used high-resolution images taken with the WFC3/HST instrument, both in optical and near-ultraviolet filters. The high quality of the images made it possible to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, and to fit the observed profile with an appropriate King model to obtain the structural parameters (e.g. core, half-mass, and tidal radii). Our findings confirm that NGC 1754 is a very compact globular cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The analysis of the same dataset allowed us to confirm a very old age ($t=12.8\pm0.4$ Gyr) for this system, thus further consolidating the indication that the process of globular cluster formation started at the same cosmic time both in the LMC and in the Milky Way, independently of the characteristics of the host environment. We have also used the empirical method called ``dynamical clock'' to estimate the dynamical age of the system. This consists of quantifying the degree of central segregation of blue straggler stars (BSSs) using the $A^+_{rh}$ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. This method yielded a value of $A^+_{rh}=0.31\pm0.07$, which is the highest measured so far for LMC clusters, pointing to an advanced dynamical age for the cluster, possibly on the verge of core collapse. The results presented here for NGC 1754 confirm that the natural dynamical evolution of globular clusters plays a role in shaping the age-core radius distributions observed in the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and coronal jets are two of the best-studied forms of solar eruptions, with the same underlying physics. Previous studies have presented partial eruptions producing coronal jets. We report, for the first time, a detailed analysis of three partial eruptions that segmented after the eruption began and produced CMEs. We use multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory, and Solar Orbiter to reconstruct the three-dimensional evolution of the events. The magnetic field extrapolations indicated that the initial filaments were overlaid by pseudostreamer structures, and the splitting occurred after the interaction between the filament-supporting flux and external open field through their null points. The breakout mechanism seems to play a key role in both halting the system and splitting it. However, this initial evolution and consequent splitting into an erupting flux rope above the prominence segment that failed to erupt poses severe challenges to theories of solar eruptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotational evolution of stars is still an open question of stellar physics because of the numerous phenomena that can contribute to the distribution of angular momentum. This paper aims at determining the time scale over which a rotating early-type star relaxes to a steady baroclinic state or, equivalently, in which case its nuclear evolution is slow enough to let the evolution of the star be modelled by a series of quasi-steady states. We investigate the damping time scale of baroclinic and viscous eigenmodes that are potentially excited by the continuous forcing of nuclear evolution. We first investigate this problem with a spherical Boussinesq model. Since much of the dynamics is concentrated in the radiative envelope of the star, we then improve the realism of the modelling by using a polytropic model of the envelope that takes into account a realistic density profile. The polytropic model of the envelope underlines the key role of the region at the core-envelope interface. The results of evolutionary models recently obtained with two-dimensional axisymmetric ESTER models turn out to be a consequence of the slow damping of viscous modes. Using a vanishing Prandtl number appears to be too strong an approximation to explain the dynamics of the models. Baroclinic modes previously thought as good candidates of this relaxation process turn out to be too quickly damped. The dynamical response of rotating stars to the slow forcing of its nuclear evolution appears as a complex combination of non-oscillating eigenmodes. Simple Boussinesq approach are not realistic enough to explain this reality. The present work underlines the key role of layers near the core-envelope interface in an early-type star and also the key role of any angular momentum transport mechanism, here played by viscosity, for early-type stars to reach critical rotation, presumably associated with the Be phenomenon.
#### SMIET: Fast and accurate synthesis of radio pulses from extensive air shower using simulated templates

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting the data from radio detectors for extensive air showers typically relies on Monte-Carlo based simulation codes, which, despite their accuracy are computationally expensive and present bottlenecks for analyses. To address this issue we developed a novel method called template synthesis, which synthesises the radio emission from cosmic ray air showers in seconds. This hybrid approach uses a microscopically simulated, sliced shower (the origin) as an input. It rescales the emission from each slice individually to synthesise the emission from a shower with different properties (the target). In order to be able to change the arrival direction during synthesis, we adjust the phases based on the expected geometrical delays. We benchmark the method by comparing synthesised traces to CoREAS simulations over a wide frequency range of [30, 500] MHz . The synthesis quality is primarily influenced by the difference in $X_{max}$ between the origin and target shower. When $\Delta X_{max} \leq 100 g/cm^2$ , the scatter on the maximum amplitudes of the geomagnetic traces is at most 4%. For the traces from the charge-excess component this scatter is smaller than 6%. We also observe a bias with $\Delta X_{max}$ up to 5% for both components, which appears to depend on the antenna position. Since the bias is symmetrical around $\Delta X_{max} = 0 g/cm^2$, we can use an interpolation approach to correct for it. We have implemented the template synthesis algorithm in a Python package called \texttt{SMIET}, which includes all the necessary parameters. This package has been successfully tested with air showers with zenith angles up to $50^{\circ}$ and can be used with any atmosphere, observation level and magnetic field. We demonstrate that the synthesis quality remains comparable to our main benchmarks across various scenarios and discuss use cases, including machine-learning-based analyses.
