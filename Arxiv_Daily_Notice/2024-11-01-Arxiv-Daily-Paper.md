 - **Abstract**
 Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) were once largely believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes, although in some rare cases, ULXs also serve as potential candidates for (sub-Eddington) intermediate mass black holes. However, a total of eight ULXs have now been confirmed to be powered by neutron stars, thanks to observed pulsations, and may act as contaminants for radio/X-ray selection of intermediate mass black holes. Here we present the first comprehensive radio study of seven known neutron star ULXs using new and archival data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, combined with the literature. Across this sample there is only one confident radio detection, from the Galactic neutron star ULX Swift J0243.6+6124. The other six objects in our sample are extragalactic, and only one has coincident radio emission, which we conclude is most likely contamination from a background HII region. We conclude that with current facilities, neutron star ULXs do not produce significant enough radio emission to cause them to be misidentified as radio/X-ray selected intermediate mass black hole candidates. Thus, if background star formation has been properly considered, the current study indicates that a ULX with a compact radio counterpart is not likely to be a neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and non-thermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple non-trivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.
#### The SRG/eROSITA diffuse soft X-ray background. I. The local hot bubble in the western Galactic hemisphere

 - **Abstract**
 The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys (eRASSs) combine the advantages of complete sky coverage and the energy resolution provided by the charge couple device and offer the most holistic and detailed view of the diffuse soft X-ray background (SXRB) to date. The first eRASS (eRASS1) was completed at solar minimum, when solar wind charge exchange emission was minimal, providing the clearest view of the SXRB. We aim to extract spatial and spectral information from each constituent of the SXRB in the western Galactic hemisphere, focusing on the local hot bubble (LHB). We extracted and analysed eRASS1 spectra from almost all directions in the western Galactic hemisphere by dividing the sky into equal signal-to-noise bins. We fitted all bins with fixed spectral templates of known background constituents. We find the temperature of the LHB exhibits a north-south dichotomy at high latitudes ($|b|>30^{\circ}$), with the south being hotter, with a mean temperature at $kT=121.8\pm0.6\,$eV and the north at $kT=100.8\pm0.5\,$eV. At low latitudes, the LHB temperature increases towards the Galactic plane, especially towards the inner Galaxy. The LHB emission measure (${\rm EM_{LHB}}$) enhances approximately towards the Galactic poles. The ${\rm EM_{LHB}}$ map shows clear anti-correlation with the local dust column density. In particular, we found tunnels of dust cavities filled with hot plasma, potentially forming a wider network of hot interstellar medium. We also constructed a three-dimensional LHB model from ${\rm EM_{LHB}}$, assuming constant density. The average thermal pressure of the LHB is $P_{\rm thermal}/k=10100^{+1200}_{-1500}\,{\rm cm^{-3}\,K}$, a lower value than typical supernova remnants and wind-blown bubbles. This could be an indication of the LHB being open towards high Galactic latitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.
#### The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band Follow-up. I. -Carbon-Chain Chemistry of Intermediate-Mass Protostars-

 - **Abstract**
 Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} < m_* <8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.
#### Radiatively Active Clouds and Magnetic Effects Explored in a Grid of Hot Jupiter GCMs

 - **Abstract**
 Cloud formation and magnetic effects are both expected to significantly impact the structures and observable properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres. For some hot Jupiters, thermal ionization and condensation can coexist in a single atmosphere, and both processes are important. We present a grid of general circulation models across a wide range of irradiation temperatures with and without incorporating the effects of magnetism and cloud formation to investigate how these processes work in tandem. We find that clouds are present in the atmosphere at all modeled irradiation temperatures, while magnetic effects are negligible for planets with irradiation temperatures cooler than 2000 K. At and above this threshold, clouds and magnetic fields shape atmospheres together, with mutual feedback. Models that include magnetism, through their influence on the temperature structure, produce more longitudinally symmetric dayside cloud coverage and more equatorially concentrated clouds on the nightside and morning terminator. To indicate how these processes would affect observables, we generate bolometric thermal and reflected phase curves from these models. The combination of clouds and magnetic effects increases thermal phase curve amplitudes and decreases peak offsets more than either process does individually.
#### Detection of the extended $\gamma$-ray emission from the new supernova remnant G321.3-3.9 with Fermi-LAT

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23572

 - **Abstract**
 With the 15 yrs of Pass 8 data recorded by the {\em Fermi} Large Area Telescope, we report the detection of an extended gigaelectronvolt emission component with a 68\% containment radius of $0^{\circ}\!.85$, which is spatially associated with the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) G321.3-3.9. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum is best described by a log-parabola model in the energy range of 100 MeV - 1 TeV, which shows a significant spectral curvature at $\sim$ 1 GeV. Either a leptonic or a hadronic model could explain the multi-wavelength data of G321.3-3.9, while the leptonic model predicts a too low strength of magnetic field. Also considering the flat radio spectrum of G321.3-3.9 and the $\gamma$-ray upper limit in the low energy band, the hadronic model is favored. The spatial coincidence between the $\gamma$-ray morphology and the diffuse thermal X-ray emission of G321.3-3.9 and the curved gigaelectronvolt $\gamma$-ray spectrum of it make G321.3-3.9 to be similar to the typical middle-aged SNRs interacting with molecular clouds. Such characteristics provide another evidence of the potential hadronic origin for its $\gamma$-ray emission. While there is no molecular cloud detected around G321.3-3.9, which challenges the hadronic model.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar magnetic activity follows regular cycles of about 11 years with an inversion of polarity in the poles every 22 years. This changing surface magnetism impacts the properties of the acoustic modes. The acoustic mode frequency shifts are a good proxy of the magnetic cycle. In this Letter we investigate solar magnetic activity cycles 23 and 24 through the evolution of the frequency shifts of low-degree modes (l= 0, 1, and 2) in three frequency bands. These bands probe properties between 74 and 1575 km beneath the surface. The analysis was carried out using observations from the space instrument Global Oscillations at Low Frequency and the ground-based Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network and Global Oscillation Network Group. The frequency shifts of radial modes suggest that changes in the magnetic field amplitude and configuration likely occur near the Sun's surface rather than near its core. The maximum shifts of solar cycle 24 occurred earlier at mid and high latitudes (relative to the equator) and about 1550 km beneath the photosphere. At this depth but near the equator, this maximum aligns with the surface activity but has a stronger magnitude. At around 74 km deep, the behaviour near the equator mirrors the behaviour at the surface, while at higher latitudes, it matches the strength of cycle 23.
#### Deep Chandra Observations of NGC 5728. III: Probing the High-Resolution X-ray Morphology and Multiphase ISM Interactions in the Circumnuclear Region

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed imaging analysis of 260 ks of sub-arcsecond resolution Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-S) observations of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728. Our study focuses on the bright and diffuse soft X-ray emission within the galaxy's inner ~1 kpc. By comparing the X-ray emission across different energy bands, we identify localized variations in the absorbing column and emission processes. We observe more X-ray absorption in the direction perpendicular to the bicone, which is co-located with an inner warped CO disk in the galaxy. The innermost region, which shows the strongest excess of hard X-ray emission, is spatially coincident with the CO(2-1) emission from ALMA and dusty spirals observed in a Hubble Space Telescope V-H color map. We detect soft extended emission associated with the circumnuclear star-forming ring at ~1 kpc, suggestive of hot gas with kT=0.44 keV. We derive measurements for the hot gas mass, M=7.9x10^5 solar masses, pressure, p=2.0x10^-10 dyne per square cm, and cooling times, t=193.2 Myr. In the vicinity of the star-forming ring, we detect two X-ray point sources with soft X-ray spectra and 0.3-7 keV luminosities L~8x10^38 erg per second. These properties suggest X-ray binaries.
