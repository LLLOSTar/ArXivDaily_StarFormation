#### The currently observed clumps cannot be the "direct" precursors of the currently observed open clusters

 - **Abstract**
 We categorized clumps, embedded clusters, and open clusters, and conducted a comparative analysis of their physical properties. Overall, the radii of open clusters are significantly larger than those of embedded clusters and clumps. The radii of embedded clusters are larger than those of clumps, which may be due to the expansion of embedded clusters. The open clusters have significantly larger masses than embedded clusters, by about one order of magnitude. Given the current mass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way, the evolutionary sequence from a single clump evolving into an embedded cluster and subsequently into an open cluster cannot account for the observed open clusters with old ages and large masses, which is also supported by N-body simulations of individual embedded clusters. To explain the mass and radius distributions of the observed open clusters, initial embedded clusters with masses larger than 3000 M$_{\odot}$ are necessary. However, the upper limit of the embedded cluster sample is less than 1000 M$_{\odot}$. And only few ATLASGAL clumps have a mass larger than 3000 M$_{\odot}$. Thus, the currently observed clumps cannot be the "direct" precursors of the currently observed open clusters. If the Milky Way has a burst-like and time-dependent star formation history, the currently observed open clusters with old ages and large masses may come from massive clumps in the past. There is also a great possibility that these open clusters originate from multiple embedded clusters mergers. We compared the separation of open clusters and the typical size of molecular clouds, and found that most molecular clouds may only form one open cluster, which supports the merger scenario. Further study is necessary to distinguish between different scenarios.
#### Finding radio transients with anomaly detection and active learning based on volunteer classifications

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we explore the applicability of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the task of finding radio transients. Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide huge volumes of data in which to detect rare transients; the challenge for astronomers is how to find them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms using 1.3 GHz light curves from the SKA precursor MeerKAT. We make use of three sets of descriptive parameters ('feature sets') as applied to two anomaly detection techniques in the Astronomaly package and analyse our performance by comparison with citizen science labels on the same dataset. By using transients found by volunteers as our ground truth, we demonstrate that anomaly detection techniques can recall over half of the radio transients in the 10 per cent of the data with the highest anomaly scores. We find that the choice of anomaly detection algorithm makes a minimal (sub-one per cent) level difference, but that feature set choice is crucial, especially when considering available resources for human inspection and/or follow-up. Active learning, where human labels are given for just 2 per cent of the data, improves recall by up to 10 percentage points, depending on the feature-model pair. The best performing feature-model pairs result in a factor of 5 times fewer sources requiring vetting by experts. This is the first effort to apply anomaly detection techniques to finding radio transients and shows great promise for application to other datasets, and as a real-time transient detection system for upcoming large surveys.
#### Synchrotron break frequencies of mildly-to-highly relativistic outflows observed off-axis

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01121

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01121

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the synchrotron spectrum produced by mildly-to-highly relativistic collisionless shocks. Simple analytic formulae are derived for the break frequencies (peak frequency, self-absorption frequency, synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling frequencies) of the emission produced by post-shock plasma elements propagating at an angle $\theta_e$ relative to the observer's line of sight. These formulae reproduce well the results of earlier exact analytic calculations valid for ultra-relativistic shocks and also hold for $\gamma<10$ and for "off-axis" propagation (deviating from the ultra-relativistic results by approximately an order of magnitude). Our results will improve parameter estimation accuracy from future observations of synchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven by the relativistic ejected material from compact objects mergers and jetted tidal disruption events. The improved accuracy for mildly relativistic velocities is essential since most events will be observed off-axis, with $\gamma<10$ outflows dominating the synchrotron emission (due to relativistic beaming). For GW170817, our results imply that (i) the Lorentz factor of the plasma emitting the observed radiation is bounded by $2.6<\gamma$ at $t\sim10$ days and by $\gamma<12$ at $t>16$ days, (ii) the interstellar medium (ISM) density, $n$, and the fraction of internal energy density held by magnetic fields, $\varepsilon_B$, are bounded by $n\cdot\varepsilon_B\lesssim 3\times10^{-7}$cm$^{-3}$. In future merger events in higher-density ISM, the peak and cooling frequencies may be identified in the radio and X-ray bands; consequently, $\gamma,n\cdot\varepsilon_B$ could be measured as opposed to the case of GW170817, where these frequencies are out of the observable range.
#### On the Onset Mechanism for Solar Coronal Jets, and Implications for the Onset Mechanism for CME-Producing Eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale solar eruptions often include ejection of a filament, a solar flare, and expulsion of a coronal mass ejection (CME). Unravelling the magnetic processes that build up the free energy for these eruptions and trigger that energy's release in the eruption is a continuing challenge in solar physics. Such large-scale eruptions are comparatively infrequent, with the moderate level ones (say, GOES M-class events) occurring perhaps once every few days on average during active-activity times, and much less frequently during quieter times. In contrast, solar coronal jets, which are long (~50,000 km), narrow (less than about 10,000 km), transient (~10--20 min) plasma spires with bright bases and that are seen in soft X-rays and EUV, occur much more frequently, likely several hundred times per day independent of large-scale solar activity level. Recent studies indicate that coronal jets are small-scale versions of large-scale eruptions, often produced by eruption of a small-scale "miniflament," that results in a "miniflare" analogous to a larger typical solar flare, and that sometimes produces a CME analogue (a "narrow CME" or "white-light jet"). Under the assumption that jets are small-scale eruptions, their higher occurrence frequency and faster build-up evolution reveals perhaps fundamental aspects of all eruptions that are not as easy to discern in the more-complex magnetic environment and the slower build up to the larger eruptions. Therefore, the study of coronal jets can provide insights into the onset mechanism of CME-producing large-scale eruptions.
#### Late-Time Supernovae Radio Re-brightening in the VAST Pilot Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We present our analysis of supernovae serendipitously found to be radio-bright several years after their optical discovery. We used recent observations from the Australian SKA Pathfinder taken as part of the pilot Variables and Slow Transients and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey programs. We identified 29 objects by cross-matching sources from these ASKAP observations with known core-collapse supernovae below a declination of $+40^{\circ}$ and with a redshift of $z\leq0.15$. Our results focus on eight cases that show potential late-time radio emission. These supernovae exhibit significantly greater amounts of radio emission than expected from the standard model of a single shockwave propagating through a spherical circumstellar medium, with a constant density structure produced by regular stellar mass-loss. We also discuss how we can learn from future ASKAP surveys about the circumstellar environments and emission mechanisms of supernovae that undergo late-time radio re-brightening. This pilot work tested and confirmed the potential of the Variables and Slow Transients survey to discover and study late-time supernova emission.
#### Compact object populations over cosmic time II. Compact object merger rates and masses over redshift from varying initial conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a first study of the impact of varying two components of the initial conditions in binary population synthesis of compact binary mergers - the initial mass function, which is made metallicity- and star formation rate-dependent, and the orbital parameter (orbital period, mass ratio and eccentricity) distributions, which are assumed to be correlated - within a larger grid of initial condition models also including alternatives for the primary mass-dependent binary fraction and the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation history. We generate the initial populations with the sampling code BOSSA and evolve them with the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS. We find strong suggestions that the main role of initial conditions models is to set the relative weights of key features defined by the evolution models. In the two models we compare, black hole-black hole (BHBH) mergers are the most strongly affected, which we connect to a shift from the common envelope to the stable Roche lobe overflow formation channels with decreasing redshift. We also characterize variations in the black hole-neutron star (BHNS) and neutron star-neutron star (NSNS) final parameter distributions. We obtain the merger rate evolution for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS mergers up to $z=10$, and find a variation by a factor of $\sim50-60$ in the local BHBH and BHNS merger rates, suggesting a more important contribution from initial conditions than previously thought, and calling for a complete exploration of the initial conditions model permutations.

 - **Abstract**
 The MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST allows for probing the molecular gas composition at mid-IR wavelengths at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. It is important to study these features in low-mass embedded protostellar systems since the formation of planets is thought to start in this phase. We present JWST/MIRI-MRS data of 18 low-mass protostellar systems in the JOYS program, focusing on gas-phase molecular lines in spectra extracted from the central protostellar positions. Besides H2, the most commonly detected molecules are H2O, CO2, CO, and OH. Other molecules such as 13CO2, C2H2, 13CCH, HCN, C4H2, CH4, and SO2 are detected only toward at most three of the sources. The JOYS data also yield the surprising detection of SiO gas toward two sources (BHR71-IRS1, L1448-mm) and for the first time CS and NH3 at mid-IR wavelengths toward a low-mass protostar (B1-c). The temperatures derived for the majority of the molecules are 100-300 K, much lower than what is typically derived toward more evolved Class II sources (>500 K). Toward three sources (e.g., TMC1-W), hot (~1000 K) H2O is detected, indicative of the presence of hot molecular gas in the embedded disks, but such warm emission from other molecules is absent. The agreement in abundance ratios with respect to H2O between ice and gas point toward ice sublimation in a hot core for a few sources (e.g., B1-c) whereas their disagreement and velocity offsets hint at high-temperature (shocked) conditions toward other sources (e.g., L1448-mm, BHR71-IRS1). The typical temperatures of the gas-phase molecules of 100-300 K are consistent with both ice sublimation in hot cores as well as high-temperature gas phase chemistry. Molecular features originating from the inner embedded disks are not commonly detected, likely because they are too extincted even at mid-IR wavelengths by small not-settled dust grains in upper layers of the disk.
#### Impact of Redshift Space Distortion on Persistent Homology of cosmic matter density field

 - **Abstract**
 By employing summary statistics obtained from Persistent Homology (PH), we investigate the influence of Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) on the topology of excursion sets formed through the super-level filtration method applied to three-dimensional matter density fields. The synthetic fields simulated by the Quijote suite in both real and redshift spaces are smoothed by accounting for the Gaussian smoothing function with different scales. The RSD leads a tendency for clusters ($\tilde{\beta}_0$) to shift towards higher thresholds, while filament loops ($\tilde{\beta}_1$) and cosmic voids ($\tilde{\beta}_2$) migrate towards lower thresholds. Notably, $\tilde{\beta}_2$ exhibits greater sensitivity to RSD compared to clusters and independent loops. As the smoothing scales increase, the amplitude of the reduced Betti number curve ($\tilde{\beta}_k$) decreases, and the corresponding peak position shifts towards the mean threshold. Conversely, the amplitude of $\tilde{\beta}_k$ remains almost unchanged with variations in redshift for $z\in[0-3]$. The analysis of persistent entropy and the overall abundance of $k$-holes indicates that the linear Kaiser effect plays a significant role compared to the non-linear effect for $R \gtrsim 30$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=0$, whereas persistent entropy proves to be a reliable measure against non-linear influences.
#### A Catalog of Pulsar X-ray Filaments

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) catalog of "pulsar X-ray filaments," or "misaligned outflows." These are linear, synchrotron radiating features powered by ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons that escape from bow shock pulsars. The filaments are misaligned with the (large) pulsar velocity, distinguishing them from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) trail which is also often visible in CXO ACIS images. Spectral fits and morphological properties are extracted for five secure filaments and three candidates using a uniform method. We present a search of archival CXO data for linear diffuse features; the known examples are recovered and a few additional weak candidates are identified. We also report on a snapshot CXO ACIS survey of pulsars with properties similar to the filament producers, finding no new filaments, but some diffuse emission including one PWN trail. Finally, we provide an updated model for the pulsar properties required to create filaments in light of these new observations.
