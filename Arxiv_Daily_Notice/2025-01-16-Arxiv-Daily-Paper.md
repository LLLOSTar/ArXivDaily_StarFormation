 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic secular perturbation theory has ignited significant interest in uncovering intricate cross-term effects, especially the interplay between 1PN and quadrupole terms. While most existing studies rely on the Lagrangian planetary perturbation method for computing cross terms, a comprehensive Hamiltonian framework for the field has been missing. In this work, we introduce a framework based on von Zeipel transformation, utilizing two sequential canonical transformations to systematically compute cross terms to arbitrary orders. Our results reveal secular cross terms up to quadrupole-squared order, showcasing remarkable consistency with both the Lagrangian method [1] and the effective-field-theory approach [2]. We present leading-order periodic cross terms arising from the interactions between 1PN and quadrupole, and present estimates of higher-order cross terms. It is demonstrated that this method not only accurately predicts the long-term evolution of hierarchical systems but also captures fast oscillations observed in N-body simulations. We identify and validate resonances caused by quadrupole-squared effects, highlighting both consistencies and discrepancies when compared to N-body simulations. These discrepancies underscore the importance of mean-motion resonances, a factor overlooked in current secular perturbation frameworks. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of the subtleties and limitations inherent to secular perturbation theory, paving the way for future research and advancements in this field.

 - **Abstract**
 Structure identification in cosmological simulations plays an important role in analysing simulation outputs. The definition of these structures directly impacts the inferred properties derived from these simulations. This paper proposes a more straightforward definition and model of structure by focusing on density peaks rather than halos and clumps. It introduces a new watershed algorithm that uses phase-space analysis to identify structures, especially in complex environments where traditional methods may struggle due to spatially overlapping structures. Additionally, a merger tree code is introduced to track density peaks across timesteps, making use of the boosted potential for identifying the most bound particles for each peak.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.

 - **Abstract**
 The past decade has seen a rise in the use of Machine Learning methods in the study of young stellar evolution. This trend has led to a growing need for a comprehensive database of young stellar objects (YSO) that goes beyond survey-specific biases and that can be employed for training, validation, and refining the physical interpretation of machine learning outcomes. We reviewed the literature focused on the Orion Star Formation complex (OSFC) to compile a thorough catalogue of previously identified YSO candidates in the region including the curation of observables relevant to probe their youth. Starting from the NASA/ADS database, we assembled YSO candidates from more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. We collated data products relevant to the study of YSOs into a dedicated catalogue, which was complemented with data from large photometric and spectroscopic surveys and in the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. We also added significant value to the catalogue by homogeneously deriving YSO infrared classification labels and through a comprehensive curation of labels concerning sources' multiplicity. Finally, we used a panchromatic approach to derive the probabilities that the sources in our catalogue were contaminant extragalactic sources or giant stars. We present the NEMESIS catalogue of YSOs for the OSFC, which includes data collated for 27879 sources covering the whole mass spectrum and the various stages of pre-Main Sequence evolution from protostars to diskless young stars. The catalogue includes a collection of panchromatic photometric data processed into spectral energy distributions, stellar parameters, infrared classes, equivalent widths of emission lines related to YSOs accretion and star-disk interaction, and absorption lines such as lithium and lines related to source's gravity, X-ray emission observables, photometric variability observables, and multiplicity labels.

 - **Abstract**
 CTA 102 is a $\gamma$-ray bright blazar that exhibited multiple flares in observations by the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope during the period of 2016-2018. We present results from the analysis of multi-wavelength light curves aiming at revealing the nature of $\gamma$-ray flares from the relativistic jet in the blazar. We analyse radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray data obtained in a period from 2012 September 29 to 2018 October 8. We identify six flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve, showing a harder-when-brighter-trend in the $\gamma$-ray spectra. We perform a cross-correlation analysis of the multi-wavelength light curves. We find nearly zero time lags between the $\gamma$-ray and optical and X-ray light curves, implying a common spatial origin for the emission in these bands. We find significant correlations between the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves as well as negative/positive time lags with the $\gamma$-ray emission lagging/leading the radio during different flaring periods. The time lags between $\gamma$-ray and radio emission propose the presence of multiple $\gamma$-ray emission sites in the source. As seen in 43 GHz images from the Very Long Baseline Array, two moving disturbances (or shocks) were newly ejected from the radio core. The $\gamma$-ray flares from 2016 to 2017 are temporally coincident with the interaction between a traveling shock and a quasi-stationary one at $\sim$0.1 mas from the core. The other shock is found to emerge from the core nearly simultaneous with the $\gamma$-ray flare in 2018. Our results suggest that the $\gamma$-ray flares originated from shock-shock interactions.
#### The polarisation behaviour of OJ 287 viewed through radio, millimetre and optical observations between 2015 and 2017

 - **Abstract**
 OJ 287 is a bright blazar with century-long observations, and one of the strongest candidates to host a supermassive black hole binary. Its polarisation behaviour between 2015 and 2017 (MJD 57300-58000) contains several interesting events that we re-contextualise in this study. We collected optical photometric and polarimetric data from several telescopes and obtained high-cadence light curves from this period. In the radio band, we collected mm-wavelength polarisation data from the AMAPOLA program. We combined these with existing multifrequency polarimetric radio results and the results of very-long-baseline-interferometry imaging with the Global mm-VLBI Array at 86 GHz. In December 2015, an optical flare was seen according to the general relativistic binary black hole model. We suggest that the overall activity near the accretion disk and the jet base during this time may be connected to the onset of a new moving component K seen in the jet in March 2017. With the additional optical data, we find a fast polarisation angle rotation of 210 degrees coinciding with the December 2015 flare, hinting at a possible link between these events. Based on the 86-GHz images, we calculated a new speed of 0.12 mas/yr for K, which places it inside the core at the time of the 2015 flare. This speed also supports the scenario where the passage of K through the quasi-stationary feature S1 could have been the trigger for the very-high-energy gamma-ray flare of OJ 287 seen in February 2017. With the mm-polarisation data, we established that these bands follow the cm-band data but show a difference during the time of K passing through S1. This indicates that the mm-bands trace the substructures of the jet still unresolved in the cm-bands.
#### Complex Structure around a Circumstellar Disk Caused by Interchange Instability

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a three-dimensional nonideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a strongly magnetized cloud core and investigate the complex structure caused by the interchange instability. This is the first simulation that does not use a central sink cell and calculates the long term ($> 10^4$ yr) evolution even as the disk and outflow formation occur. The magnetic field dissipates inside the disk, and magnetic flux accumulates around the edge of the disk, leading to the occurrence of interchange instability. During the main accretion phase, the interchange instability occurs recurrently, disturbing the circumstellar region and forming ring, arc, and cavity structures. These are consistent with recent high-resolution observations of circumstellar regions around young protostars. The structures extend to $>1,000$ au and persist for at least 30,000 yr after protostar formation, demonstrating the dynamic removal process of magnetic flux during star formation. We find that the disk continues to grow even as interchange instability occurs, by accretion through channels between the outgoing cavities. The outflow is initially weak, but becomes strong after $\sim 10^3$ yr.

 - **Abstract**
 The mismatch between the mass function of the Milky Way's embedded clusters (ECs) and that of open clusters (OCs) raises the question of whether each OC originates from a single EC. In this work, we explore a scenario in which OCs form as a result of post-gas expulsion coalescence of ECs within the same parental molecular cloud. We model this process using N-body simulations of ECs undergoing expansion due to gas expulsion. Our initial conditions are based on the observed spatial, kinematic, and mass distributions of ECs in three representative massive star-forming regions (MSFRs). Initially, ECs are isolated. After further expansion, interactions between ECs begin, mutually influencing their evolution. We examine this process as a function of gas expulsion timescales, spatial separations between ECs, and their relative velocities. Our results demonstrate that, within a reasonable range of these parameters, the coalescence of ECs is robust and largely insensitive to initial conditions. The mass of ECs plays a critical role in the coalescence process. More massive ECs form stable gravitational cores, which greatly facilitate coalescence and help the resulting cluster resist expansion and Galactic tidal forces. Additionally, the number of ECs also enhances coalescence. The current mass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way suggests that directly forming massive ECs is challenging. However, the coalescence of multiple low-mass ECs can account for the observed parameter space of OCs in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of correlations between high Li abundances and strong chromospheric He I 10830 Å absorption line strengths in Kepler field giant stars. Our sample includes 84 giants with detectable solar-like oscillations in their lightcurves, and their Li abundances come from the literature or were measured here using LAMOST medium-resolution spectra. Evolutionary phases are determined through asteroseismic analysis, with mixed-mode period spacing (\Delta P) used to infer the time evolution of RC giants. Near-infrared observations of the He I \lambda 10830 line were obtained with the high-resolution Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). We find high Li abundances and strong He I lines exclusively among red clump (RC) giants, with their absence in red giant branch stars suggesting a shared origin linked to the He-flash. Additionally, a steady decline in He I strength with decreasing Li abundance among RC giants indicates a correlation between these properties. Older, Li-normal RC giants are He-weak, while most younger super-Li-rich giants are He-strong, suggesting temporal evolution of both phenomena. We hypothesize that the core He-flash and subsequent sub-flashes may enhance Li abundances in RC giant photospheres and trigger heightened chromospheric activity, leading to stronger He I \lambda 10830 Å lines in younger RCs. Over time, post-He-flash, chromospheric activity diminishes, resulting in weaker He I lines in older, Li-normal RCs.
#### On the abiotic origin of dimethyl sulfide: discovery of DMS in the Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 Following the discovery of dimethyl sulfide (CH$_3$SCH$_3$, DMS) signatures in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we report the first detection of this organosulfur species in the interstellar medium, during the exploration of an ultradeep molecular line survey performed toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 with the Yebes 40$\,$m and IRAM 30$\,$m telescopes. We derive a molecular column density of $N$ = (2.6 $\pm$ 0.3)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, yielding a fractional abundance relative to H$_2$ of $\sim$1.9$\times$10$^{-10}$. This implies that DMS is a factor of $\sim$1.6 times less abundant than its structural isomer CH$_3$CH$_2$SH and $\sim$30 times less abundant than its O-analogue dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) toward this cloud, in excellent agreement with previous results on various O/S pairs. Furthermore, we find a remarkable resemblance between the relative abundance of DMS/CH$_3$OH in G+0.693-0.027 ($\sim$1.7$\times$10$^{-3}$) and in the comet ($\sim$1.3$\times$10$^{-3}$), further strengthening the connection between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and that of the minor bodies of the Solar System. Although the chemistry of DMS beyond Earth is yet to be fully disclosed, this discovery provides conclusive observational evidence on its efficient abiotic production in the interstellar medium, casting doubts about using DMS as a reliable biomarker in exoplanet science.
#### The case for a low dark matter density in dynamical dark energy model from local probes

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate, through a Bayesian study, the ability of a local low matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$, in discrepancy with the value usually inferred from the CMB angular power spectrum, to accommodate observations from local probes without being in tension with the local values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ or the matter fluctuation $\sigma_8$ parameters. For that, we combine multiple local probes, with the criteria that they either can constrain the matter density parameter independently from the CMB constraints, or can help in doing so after making their relevant observations more model independent by relaxing their relevant calibration parameters. We assume however, either a dynamical dark energy model, or the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, when computing the corresponding theoretical observables. We also add, in almost all of our Monte Carlo runs, the latest Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI year one release to our core group. We found that, within $\Lambda$CDM model, for different combinations of our probes, we can accommodate a low matter density along with the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ values usually obtained from local probes, providing we promote the sound drag $r_s$ component in BAO calculations to a free parameter, and that even if we combine with the Pantheon+ Supernova sample. Assuming $w_0w_a$CDM, we also found that relaxing $r_s$ allow us to accommodate $\Omega_{\rm M}$, $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ within their local values, with still however a preference for $w_0w_a$ values far from $\Lambda$CDM. However, when including Pantheon+ Supernova sample, we found that the latter preference for high matter density pushes $\sigma_8$ to much smaller values, mitigating by then a low matter density solution to the two common tensions. We conclude that a low matter density value, helps in preserving the concordance within $\Lambda$CDM model. (abridged)
