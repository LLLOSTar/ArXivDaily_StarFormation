 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact with the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and magma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, finding that our models can provide a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a sub-Neptune.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) plays an important role in many physical processes, including forming stars and shaping complex ISM structures. In this work, we investigate the HI turbulent properties of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to reveal what physical mechanisms drive the turbulence and at what scales. Using the high-resolution HI data of the Galactic ASKAP (GASKAP) survey and multi-point structure functions (SF), we perform a statistical analysis of HI turbulence in 34 subregions of the SMC. Two-point SFs tend to show a linear trend, and their slope values are relatively uniform across the SMC, suggesting that large-scale structures exist and are dominant in the two-point SFs. On the other hand, seven-point SF enables us to probe small-scale turbulence by removing large-scale fluctuations, which is difficult to achieve with the two-point SFs. In the seven-point SFs, we find break features at scales of 34-84 pc, with a median scale of $\sim$50 pc. This result indicates the presence of small-scale turbulent fluctuations in the SMC and quantifies its scale. In addition, we find strong correlations between slope values of the seven-point SFs and the stellar feedback-related quantities (e.g., H$\alpha$ intensities, the number of young stellar objects, and the number of HI shells), suggesting that stellar feedback may affect the small-scale turbulent properties of the HI gas in the SMC. Lastly, estimated sonic Mach numbers across the SMC are subsonic, which is consistent with the fact that the HI gas of the SMC primarily consists of the warm neutral medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Liller 1 is a stellar system orbiting within the inner 0.8kpc of the Galactic centre, characterised by a wide spread in age and metallicity, indicating a high mass. Liller 1 has been proposed to be a major contributor to the stellar mass of the Galactic bulge, yet its origin is subject to debate. We employ Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to test scenarios proposed to explain the nature of Liller 1. Using a random sampling technique, we contrast the chemical compositions of Liller 1 stellar members with those of the bulge, inner disc, outer disk and solar neighbourhood. The chemistry of Liller 1 deviates from that of the bulge population at the 2-3$\sigma$ level for $\alpha$-elements Mg, Si, and Ca. We conclude that the progenitor of Liller 1 was not a major contributor of stellar mass to the bulge. Furthermore, we find the abundance pattern of Liller 1 to deviate at the 2$\sigma$ level from that of inner disk stars, ruling out the cluster rejuvenation scenario. Finally, we find that Liller 1 is chemically distinct from solar and outer disc populations, suggesting that the progenitor of Liller 1 is unlikely to be an in-situ massive clump formed at high redshift, from disc gravitational instabilities, that migrated inwards and coalesced with others into the bulge. Finally, we suggest that Liller 1 is a minor contributor to the stellar mass of the inner Galaxy, possibly of extragalactic origin.

 - **Abstract**
 The latest GWTC-4 release from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration nearly doubles the known population of double compact object mergers and reveals a new trimodal structure in the chirp-mass distribution of merging binary black holes (BBHs) below 30 Msun. Recent detailed stellar evolution models show that features in the pre-collapse cores of massive stars produce a bimodal black hole (BH) mass distribution, which naturally extends to a trimodal BBH chirp-mass distribution. Both distributions depend only weakly on metallicity, implying universal structural features which can be tested with LVK observations. Using a new compact-remnant mass prescription derived from these models, we perform rapid population synthesis simulations to test the robustness of the predicted chirp-mass structure against uncertainties in binary evolution and cosmic star formation history, and compare these results with the current observational data. The trimodal chirp-mass distribution emerges as a robust outcome of the new remnant-mass model, persisting across variations in binary and cosmic physics. In contrast, traditional BH formation models lacking a bimodal BH mass spectrum fail to reproduce the observed trimodality. The updated models also predict lower BBH merger rates by a factor of a few, in closer agreement with LVK constraints. Intriguingly, the central chirp-mass peak, dominated by unequal-mass BBHs, originates from a previously underappreciated formation pathway in which strong luminous blue variable winds suppress binary interaction before the first BH forms. If isolated binary evolution dominates BBH formation below 30 Msun, the relative heights of the three chirp-mass peaks offer powerful observational constraints on core collapse, BH formation, binary evolution, and cosmic star formation. These universal structural features may also serve as standard sirens for precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Two extreme events in the universe, fast radio bursts (FRBs) and cosmic rays (CRs), could be corelated, where FRBs with extreme field strength near their sources may contribute to CRs. This study investigates localized particle acceleration driven by FRB-like ultra-relativistic electromagnetic pulses. It is found ultra-high energy neutral plasma sheets form constantly via the front erosion of an FRB pulse. There are two ion acceleration regimes depending upon the field strength and the plasma density: the wakefield regime dominated by charge separation fields, and the piston regime driven by the $\mathbf{V}\times\mathbf{B}$ force of the pulses. The predicted energy scalings align well with particle-in-cell simulations. A power-law energy spectrum naturally arises with an index close to the CRs during FRB diffusion outward. Joint observations of FRBs and CRs may provide an opportunity to understand these extreme events and advance the development of multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Methanol is a seed species of complex organic molecules that is of fundamental importance in astrochemistry. Although various isotopologues of CH$_3$OH have been detected in the interstellar medium (ISM), CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH is only tentatively detected in Sgr~B2. To confirm the presence of CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH in the ISM and to investigate its abundance, we search for its emission lines in the Orion~KL region. We have obtained image cubes covering the frequency ranges 236.40~GHz-236.65~GHz and 231.68~GHz-231.88~GHz using ALMA archival data observed toward the Orion~KL region. The column densities of CH$_3$$^{17}$OH and CH$_3$$^{18}$OH are estimated under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium condition with fixed excitation temperatures at the two CH$_3$$^{18}$OH peaks, MeOH1 and MeOH2,. We have identified six emission lines of CH$_{3}$$^{17}$OH in MeOH1 and MeOH2 and confirmed that the line profiles and spatial distributions are consistent with those of CH$_3$$^{18}$OH. The abundance ratios of CH$_3$$^{18}$OH/CH$_3$$^{17}$OH are evaluated to be $\sim 3.4-3.5$ and are similar to the canonical value of $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O $\sim 3-4$ derived from CO observations in the Orion~KL region. We have compared the results with the previous study of CH$_3$OH and evaluated CH$_3$$^{16}$OH/CH$_3$$^{17}$OH ratios to be $\sim 2300-2500$ at a resolution of $\sim 4$~arcsec. The ratios are close to the $^{16}$O/$^{17}$O ratio in the local ISM. This result indicates that the CH$_3$OH isotopologues can serve as new tracers of oxygen isotope ratios in star-forming regions because the opacity of CH$_3$OH can be evaluated using transition lines spanning a wide range of line intensities. Moreover, this method enables us to study the star-formation history of our Galaxy with the aid of the Galactic chemical evolution models.
#### Probing sulfur chemistry in oxygen-rich AGB stars with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur and its isotopic ratios play a crucial role in understanding astrophysical environments, providing insights into nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, star formation, planetary evolution, and galactic chemistry. We investigate the distribution of sulfur bearing species $\rm{SO_2}$, $\rm{^{34}SO_2}$, SO, and $\rm{^{34}SO}$ towards five oxygen rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars ($o$ Ceti, R Dor, W Hya, R Leo, and EP Aqr), along with their excitation temperatures, column densities, and isotopic ratios. Using ALMA Band 6,7,8 data and CASSIS, we detect these species and estimate excitation temperature and column density via the rotational diagram and MCMC methods under LTE. Line imaging of various transitions is used to infer spatial distributions. The excitation temperatures of $\rm{SO_2}$ range from $\sim$200-600 K with column densities of $\rm{1-7\times10^{16}\ cm^{-2}}$, while $\rm{^{34}SO_2}$ shows comparable or slightly lower values and about an order of magnitude lower column densities. The $\rm{^{32}S/^{34}S}$ ratios for R Dor and W Hya are near solar, slightly higher for $o$ Ceti, and lower for EP Aqr and R Leo. Most detected lines exhibit centralized emission: high excitation $\rm{SO_2}$ traces compact hot gas in inner CSEs, whereas low-excitation lines trace more extended structures. Morphological differences, irregular emission in $o$ Ceti, circular in R Leo and W Hya, clumpy in R Dor, and unresolved in EP Aqr may arise from variations in physical conditions, multiplicity, outflows, rotation, desorption processes, UV or cosmic ray effects, or observational resolution. Overall, the centralized SO and $\rm{SO_2}$ emissions support previous findings for low mass-loss rate AGB stars, and the $\rm{^{32}S/^{34}S}$ ratios likely reflect natal cloud composition, with deviations linked to metallicity or excitation conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative feedback from massive stars plays a central role in the evolution of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium. This paper presents a multi-wavelength analysis of the bright-rimmed cloud, BRC 44, which is located at the periphery of the Hii region Sh2-145 and is excited by the massive stars in the region. We use a combination of archival and newly obtained infrared data, along with new optical observations, to provide a census of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region and to estimate stellar parameters such as age, mass etc. The spatial distribution of YSOs visible in the optical wavelength suggests that they are distributed in separate clumps compared to the embedded YSOs and are relatively older. Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of four YSOs in this region using the TANSPEC mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) confirms their youth. From Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting, most of the embedded YSO candidates are in their early stage of evolution, with the majority of them in their Class II and some in Class I stage. The relative proper motions of the YSOs with respect to the ionizing source are indicative of the rocket effect in the BRC. The 12CO, 13CO, and C18O observations with the Purple Mountain Observatory are used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in the region. A comparison of the cold molecular gas distribution with simple analytical model calculations shows that the cloud is in the compression stage, and massive stars may be influencing the formation of young embedded stars in the BRC region due to radiative feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters. Different models predict merger rates ranging from 15.4 to $96.7\,\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ at redshift $z$ = 0.2, and detection rates ranging from 22.2 to 148.3$\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ under the assumption of a detectable redshift range of $z \le$ 1.0.

 - **Abstract**
 The composition and internal structure of gas giant exoplanets encode key information about their formation and subsequent evolution. We investigate how different interior structure assumptions affect the inferred bulk metallicity and its correlation with planetary mass. For a sample of 44 giant exoplanets (0.12-5.98 MJ), we compute evolutionary models with CEPAM and retrieve their bulk metallicities under three structural hypotheses: Core+Envelope (CE), Dilute Core (DC), and Fully Mixed (FM). Across all structures, we recover a significant positive correlation between total heavy-element mass (M_Z) and planetary mass (M), and a negative correlation between metallicity (Z) and M (also for Z/Z_star vs. M). DC structures yield metallicities comparable to CE models, regardless of the assumed gradient extent. Increasing atmospheric metallicity raises the inferred bulk metallicity, as enhanced opacities slow planetary cooling. Non-adiabatic DC models can further increase the retrieved metallicity by up to 35%. Sensitivity analyses show that the mass-metallicity anti-correlation is primarily driven by low-mass, metal-rich planets, while massive planets exhibit unexpectedly high metallicities. Improved constraints on convective mixing, combined with upcoming precise measurements of planetary masses, radii, and atmospheric compositions from missions such as PLATO and Ariel, will enable more robust inferences of interior structures and formation pathways for gas giant planets.
#### MOLLId: software for automatic identification of spectral molecular lines in the sub-millimeter and millimeter bands and its application to the spectra of protostars from the region RCW 120

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present the program MOLLId (MOLecular Line Identification) for automated molecular lines approximation with gaussian profile. Molecular identification was performed using multi-level comparison of the lines' center frequencies and rest frequencies from the spectroscopic database. The program was tested using identification of the molecular lines in observational spectra of young stellar objects RCW 120 YSO S1 and RCW 120 YSO S2, located near the border of the RCW 120 PDR. In the spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S1 source, 100 lines of 41 molecules were identified over the level of 4-6 sigma. In the spectra of the RCW 120 YSO S2 source, 407 lines of 79 molecules were identified over the level 3-5 sigma. Using Intel Core i7-12700K CPU, identification time is equal to 6 and 8 minutes per spectral range for the YSOs S1 and S2, respectively. From the analysis of CH3OH, CH3CN, CH3CCH molecules identified in RCW 120 YSO S2 we found a two-component structure and estimated the physical parameters in the LTE approximation for each of the components.

 We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field. Our architecture combines a convolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables efficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality relative to a U-Net-only approach. Specifically, our hybrid network recovers both clustering amplitudes and phases better than the U-Net on small scales.
#### Fragmentation-limited dust filtration in 2D simulations of planet-disk systems with dust coagulation. Parameter study and implications for the inner disk's dust mass budget and composition

 - **Abstract**
 Super-thermal gas giant planets or their progenitor cores are known to open deep gaps in protoplanetary disks, which stop large, drifting dust particles on their way to the inner disk. The possible separation of the disk into distinct reservoirs and the resulting dust depletion interior to the gap have important implications for planetesimal formation and the chemical and isotopic composition of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Dust fragmentation, however, maintains a reservoir of small grains which can traverse the gap. Dust evolution models are thus instrumental for studies of a gap's filtration efficiency. We present 2D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk systems with dust coagulation and fragmentation. For the first time, we evolve a series of 2D simulation with dust coagulation over 45000 planetary orbits and track the dust's size evolution and origin by using the TriPoD dust coagulation method. We investigate the effects of different planetary masses, fragmentation velocities, and viscosities on the inner disk's dust mass budget and composition, and highlight the advantages of multi-dimensional simulations over 1D models. Filtering can only be efficient for high planetary masses, high fragmentation velocities, and low diffusivities. Clear compositional distinctions between the inner and outer disk could not have been maintained by Jupiter's core if the fragmentation velocity was low, even if $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$. Significant "contamination" of the inner disk by outer-disk dust occurs in much less than $2 \times 10^5$ yr in this case and even for more massive objects. This either places tight constraints on the physical conditions in the Solar nebula or mandates consideration of alternative explanations for the NC-CC dichotomy. Astrophysical constraints on the parameters could discriminate between these possibilities.
