 - **Abstract**
 Differential measurement of the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p (the electron-to-proton mass ratio) toward two sources located near the Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds - show a lower mu compared to its terrestrial value. Based on methanol (CH3OH) emission lines from the frequency range 80-112 GHz (IRAM 30-m telescope archival data), the calculated difference (Delta mu)/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab is equal to (-3.0 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.) in the whole cloud SgrB2. The revealed 5 sigma signal in mu-variations agrees within the margin of error with the recently obtained result based on methanol emission lines from the higher frequency range 542-543 GHz (Herschel space telescope archival data) for SgrB2(N): (Delta mu)/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7).

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is set to conduct a generation-defining SN Ia cosmology measurement with its High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS). However, between optical elements, exposure times, cadences, and survey areas, there are many survey parameters to consider. This work was part of a Roman Project Infrastructure Team effort to help the Core Community Survey (CCS) Committee finalize the HLTDS recommendation to the Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee. We simulate 1,000 surveys, with and without a conservative (volume-limited) version of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Deep Drilling Field SNe Ia, and compute Fisher-matrix-analysis Dark Energy Task Force Figures of Merit (FoM, based on w0-wa constraints) for each. We investigate which survey parameters correlate with FoM, as well as the dependence of the FoM values on calibration uncertainties and the SN dispersion model. The exact optimum depends on the assumed dispersion model and whether Rubin DDF SNe Ia are also considered, but ~20% time in prism, ~30--40% time in Wide imaging and the remainder in Deep imaging seems most promising. We also advocate for "interlaced" cadences where not every filter is used in every cadence step to reduce overheads while maintaining a good cadence and increasing the number of filters compared to the Rose et al. (2021) reference survey (the prism has proportionately lower overheads and can be used for each cadence step). We show simulated light curves and spectra for the baseline HLTDS CCS recommendation and release distance-modulus covariance matrices for all surveys to the community.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss a modification of a recently developed numerical scheme for evolving spherically symmetric self-gravitating systems to include the effects of self-interacting dark matter. The approach is far more efficient than traditional N-body simulations and cross sections with different dependencies on velocity and scattering-angle are easily accommodated. To demonstrate, we provide results of a simulation, which runs quickly on a personal computer, that shows the expected initial flattening of the inner region of an NFW halo as well as the later gravothermal collapse instability that leads to a dense core at the galactic center. We note that this approach can also be used, with some augmentation, to simulate the dynamics in globular clusters by modeling gravitational hard scattering as a self-interaction.
#### Long Term Reverberation Mapping of Iron Coronal Lines in MKN 110

 - **Abstract**
 We present flux measurements of the coronal lines [Fe VII] and [Fe X] spanning three decades, in the highly variable Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) MKN 110. These coronal lines are sensitive to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGNs in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Neither [Fe VII] nor [Fe X] demonstrates variability in the short term on a weekly or monthly timescale. However, by taking advantage of a long term decrease in the continuum flux of MKN 110 on the order of years, we were able to track the [Fe VII] and [Fe X] fluxes as they respond to the continuum. We were able to detect a lag for [Fe VII] relative to the continuum at 5100 Å, with a modal lag of 652 days, but were unable to detect a significant lag in the [Fe x] flux, though there exist significant uncertainties in the [Fe X] fit. These two lag results are not consistent and the line widths for the two line species also do not match. This provides strong evidence for stratification within the coronal line region (CLR). There is also evidence of a non-varying component within the coronal line flux, probably a result of a more extended region of origin. Taken together, these results suggest a CLR where the bulk of the [Fe VII] originates on parsec scales, but a portion of the [Fe VII] flux originates further out, at or beyond a 10 pc scale. These results also indicate the limitations of single-cloud models in describing the physical conditions of the CLR.

 - **Abstract**
 A core motivation of science is to evaluate which scientific model best explains observed data. Bayesian model comparison provides a principled statistical approach to comparing scientific models and has found widespread application within cosmology and astrophysics. Calculating the Bayesian evidence is computationally challenging, especially as we continue to explore increasingly more complex models. The Savage-Dickey density ratio (SDDR) provides a method to calculate the Bayes factor (evidence ratio) between two nested models using only posterior samples from the super model. The SDDR requires the calculation of a normalised marginal distribution over the extra parameters of the super model, which has typically been performed using classical density estimators, such as histograms. Classical density estimators, however, can struggle to scale to high-dimensional settings. We introduce a neural SDDR approach using normalizing flows that can scale to settings where the super model contains a large number of extra parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this neural SDDR methodology applied to both toy and realistic cosmological examples. For a field-level inference setting, we show that Bayes factors computed for a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) and simulation-based inference (SBI) approach are consistent, providing further validation that SBI extracts as much cosmological information from the field as the BHM approach. The SDDR estimator with normalizing flows is implemented in the open-source harmonic Python package.
#### Planet Earth in reflected and polarized light: II. Refining contrast estimates for rocky exoplanets with ELT and HWO

 - **Abstract**
 The characterization of nearby rocky exoplanets will become feasible with the next generation of telescopes, such as the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) and the mission concept Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Using an improved model setup, we aim to refine the estimates of reflected and polarized light contrast for a selected sample of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. We perform advanced 3D radiative transfer simulations for Earth-like planets orbiting G-type and M-type stars. Our simulations incorporate realistic, wavelength-dependent surface albedo maps and a detailed cloud treatment, including 3D cloud structures and inhomogeneities, to better capture their radiative response. These improvements are based on Earth observations. We present models of increasing complexity, ranging from simple homogeneous representations to a detailed Earth-as-an-exoplanet model. Our results show that averaging homogeneous models fails to capture Earth's full complexity, especially in polarization. Moreover, simplistic cloud models distort the representation of absorption lines at high spectral resolutions, particularly in water bands, potentially biasing atmospheric chemical abundance estimates. Additionally, we provide updated contrast estimates for observing rocky exoplanets around nearby stars with upcoming instruments such as ANDES and PCS at the ELT. Compared to previous studies, our results indicate that reflected light contrast estimates are overestimated by a factor of two when simplified cloud and surface models are used. Instead, measuring the fractional polarization in the continuum and in high-contrast, high-resolution spectra may be more effective for characterizing nearby Earth-like exoplanets. These refined estimates are essential for guiding the design of future ELT instruments and the HWO mission concept.

 - **Abstract**
 The mid-M star TOI~1227 hosts among the youngest known transiting exoplanets. We have conducted new X-ray imaging and optical spectroscopic observations of TOI 1227 aimed at ascertaining its age and the influence of its high-energy radiation on the exoplanet, TOI 1227b. We obtained a definitive X-ray detection of TOI 1227 with Chandra/HRC-I, and measured its Li and H$\alpha$ lines using ANU SSO 2.3 m telescope (WiFeS) spectroscopy. Through spatiokinematic, isochronal, and SED-based modeling, we have constrained the age of TOI 1227 as lying between 5 Myr and 12 Myr, with a best estimate of $\sim$8 Myr. In the context of this age, we model the evolution of the transiting exoplanet TOI 1227b, using the X-ray luminosity derived from Chandra HRC-I imaging. Our modeling suggests that TOI 1227b is currently undergoing rapid atmospheric mass loss at rates on the order of $\sim 10^{12}$ g s$^{-1}$. The modeling demonstrates that the exoplanet's predicted future evolution depends sensitively on assumptions for total and core planet mass, highlighting the importance of follow-up observations of the TOI 1227 star-exoplanet system to enable measurements of both planetary mass and mass-loss rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio wavelengths offer a unique window into high-energy astrophysical phenomena that may be obscured or too rapidly evolving to be captured at other wavelengths. Leveraging data from the Very Large Array Sky Survey, we perform a systematic search for fast, luminous transients with characteristic timescales $\lesssim 3$ years in the nearby universe ($z \leq 0.3$). We report the discovery of five such transients, and classify them based on their synchrotron emission energetics and host galaxy properties. From this sample, we derive observational constraints on the volumetric rates of certain corresponding transient classes. We limit the rates of accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs with dense circumstellar medium interaction (and those producing pulsar wind nebulae) at $\lesssim 1.10_{-0.90}^{+2.60}$% ($\lesssim 0.20_{-0.10}^{+5.80}$%) of the local Type Ia supernova rate, respectively, broadly consistent with theoretical predictions. For AT2018cow-like radio-bright luminous fast blue optical transients, we estimate a rare occurrence rate of $\lesssim 0.02_{-0.01}^{+0.32}$% of the local core-collapse supernova rate. We constrain the local volumetric rates of long- and short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to be $\lesssim 11.46_{-9.48}^{+26.28}$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 80.88_{-66.90}^{+185.87}$~Gpc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$, respectively. These estimates incorporate beaming corrections, with median detectable viewing angles derived from afterglow simulations of $\sim 0.4$ and $\sim 0.3$ radians for long- and short-duration GRBs. Our findings highlight the potential of radio surveys to uncover rare, energetic transients. We emphasize the critical role of coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up in fully characterizing these enigmatic events.
#### Analysis of Jet Dynamics and Collimation Characteristics of 0241+622 on Parsec Scales

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a detailed analysis of the jet structure and dynamics of the source 0241+622 on milliarcsecond (mas) scales. We stacked images from multiple epochs to better recover the crosssection of the jet. By analyzing the relationship between jet width and distance, we observed that the jet exhibits a parabolic shape from the core, spanning a region from 0.12 to 6.1 mas. This structure suggests the acceleration and collimation processes of the jet. Beyond 18 mas from the core, the jet adopts a conical shape, and the expansion speed of the jet becomes faster within the range from 4500 to 6500 mas. We obtained the core shift of this source using five pairs of data from VLBA at 1.6 GHz to 43 GHz. Based on previous studies, through proper motion analysis of the jet components, we estimated the angle between the jet and the line of sight to be approximately 65.7°, so 1 mas corresponds to 0.95 pc (de-projected distance). We then obtained the velocity field of the source within 3.14 mas from the central black hole and found that the jet exhibits accelerated motion within this range. At approximately 6.1 mas from the core, we observed that the jet width begins to decrease, which we identified as possibly corresponding to the Bondi radius of this source. The reduction in jet width may be related to changes in the external environmental pressure, particularly within the Bondi radius, indicating that the jet dynamics and collimation characteristics are strongly influenced by the surrounding medium conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The appearance of blue loops in the evolutionary tracks of intermediate-mass core He-burning stars is essential for explaining the observed characteristics of Cepheids. The blue loops for lower mass Cepheids cannot always be reproduced when only classical, local mixing length theory (MLT) is used. Additionally, classical models result in a mass discrepancy compared to pulsational and dynamical mass determinations. Both problems can be resolved through an ad-hoc extension of the MLT for convection. We use the non-local Kuhfuss turbulent convection model (TCM) which can explain overshooting directly from the solution of the TCM equations. The primary objective of this study is to test the predictions of the Kuhfuss TCM when applied to intermediate-mass core He-burning stars and validate the model predictions against observations of Cepheids. We used the state-of-the-art 1D stellar evolution code GARSTEC with the implementation of the Kuhfuss TCM and computed evolutionary tracks for intermediate-mass core He-burning stars. We compare these tracks with those computed with MLT including and excluding ad-hoc overshooting and with observations of five Cepheids in detached binary systems obtained from the literature. The stellar evolution tracks generated using the Kuhfuss TCM and MLT with ad-hoc overshooting exhibit similar appearances. Overshoot mixing from the convective boundaries and the occurrence of the Cepheid blue-loop have been achieved naturally as solutions to the Kuhfuss TCM equations. Furthermore, these models successfully reproduce observed stellar parameters including mass, luminosity, radius, and effective temperature. In conclusion, our TCM approach reproduces Cepheid blue loops and agrees with observations similarly well as MLT models with overshooting, however, without fine-tuning the model parameters or ad-hoc assumptions.
#### Rate constants and product yields for the C + CH3CHO reaction at low temperatures

 - **Abstract**
 Reactions involving atomic carbon in its ground electronic state, C(3P), play an important role in astrochemistry due to high C-atom abundance levels. Here we performed a kinetic investigation of the reaction between C(3P) and acetaldehyde, CH3CHO, determining rate constants for this process over the 50-296 K range. Measurements of the formation of atomic hydrogen, H(2S), were also performed to provide insight into product formation. Experiments were conducted using a supersonic flow reactor coupled with pulsed laser photolysis for C-atom generation and pulsed laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum ultraviolet range for the detection of both C(3P) and H(2S) atoms. Quantum chemical calculations of the ground triplet state potential energy surface of C3H4O were also performed to provide theoretical support for the measurements. The rate constants were large and temperature independent with an average value of 4.0 x 10-10 cm3 s-1. This result is consistent with the theoretical results which predict either very low barriers or none at all on the underlying potential energy surface. Although experimental difficulties prevented the quantitative determination of H-atom formation, qualitatively, H-atom yields were very low with CH3CH/C2H4 + CO as the major products based on the calculations. The influence of this reaction on interstellar chemistry was tested using a gas-grain model of dense interstellar clouds. These simulations predict that the C(3P) + CH3CHO reaction decreases gas-phase CH3CHO abundances by more than an order of magnitude at early and intermediate cloud ages, with a lower influence at typical dense cloud ages.

 - **Abstract**
 We present photometric time series data spanning 2018-2024 that show the effects of temporal dynamics in the binary system KH 15D, a member of the NGC 2264 star forming region. This source exhibits complex eclipsing behavior due to a precessing circumbinary disk or ring that is slightly inclined relative to the orbital plane of the binary. Using g-band and r-band observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) over seven observing seasons, we follow the evolution of the KH 15D lightcurve as it continues to emerge from its deepest observed photometric minimum about 15 years ago. Our observations are consistent with previous models that propose a precessing, warped circumbinary disk orbiting KH 15D. We verify the gradual precession of the disk by quantifying the times of eclipse ingresses and egresses. We also examine the central re-brightening within the minima of the phased lightcurve. This feature has increased in amplitude over our observing seasons, and we measure its evolution in both amplitude and phase from year to year. Finally, we assess color as a function of phase and brightness. Our findings support the assertion that line-of-sight variations in disk density and structure, possibly due to clumping, coupled with a precessing circumbinary disk are responsible for the central re-brightening event.
#### Constraints on the progenitor models of fast radio bursts from population synthesis with the first CHIME/FRB catalog

 - **Abstract**
 Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic radio transients with unknown origins. We performed comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog to test whether the FRB population tracks the cosmic star formation history directly or requires a delay. By fully considering CHIME's complex selection effects and beam response, we find that the hypothesis that the FRB population tracks the SFH is not ruled out by the current data, although a small delay is preferred. This is consistent with the scenario in which young magnetars formed through core-collapse supernovae serve as the progenitors of FRBs. However, we estimate the local volumetric rate of FRB sources with energy above $10^{38}$ erg to be $2.3^{+2.4}_{-1.2} \times 10^5~\rm{Gpc}^{-3}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with previous results. This high volumetric rate means the core-collapse magnetar scenario alone cannot fully account for the observed population. Further theoretical efforts are required to explore alternative or additional progenitor channels for FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simulation of the time-domain catalog for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's High-Latitude Time-Domain Core Community Survey. This simulation, called the Hourglass simulation, uses the most up-to-date spectral energy distribution models and rate measurements for ten extra-galactic time-domain sources. We simulate these models through the design reference Roman Space Telescope survey: four filters per tier, a five day cadence, over two years, a wide tier of 19 deg$^2$ and a deep tier of 4.2 deg$^2$, with $\sim$20% of those areas also covered with prism observations. We find that a science-independent Roman time-domain catalog, assuming a S/N at max of >5, would have approximately 21,000 Type Ia supernovae, 40,000 core-collapse supernovae, around 70 superluminous supernovae, $\sim$35 tidal disruption events, 3 kilonovae, and possibly pair-instability supernovae. In total, Hourglass has over 64,000 transient objects, 11 million photometric observations, and 500,000 spectra. Additionally, Hourglass is a useful data set to train machine learning classification algorithms. We show that SCONE is able to photometrically classify Type Ia supernovae with high precision ($\sim$95%) to a z > 2. Finally, we present the first realistic simulations of non-Type Ia supernovae spectral-time series data from Roman's prism.
#### PDRs4All XIV: CH radical and $H_3^+$ molecular ion in the irradiated protoplanetary disk d203-506

 - **Abstract**
 Most protoplanetary disks experience a phase in which they are subjected to strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can substantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and molecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science program. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species using a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this purpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of ro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H$_3^+$ molecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10$^{-7}$ and approximately 10$^{-8}$, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by gas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H$_3^+$ is usually formed through reactions of H$_2$ with H$_2^+$ originating from cosmic ray ionization of H$_2$. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that H$_3^+$ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated ($G_0>$10$^3$), dense ($n_{\rm H} >10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The latter is favored as an explanation for the presence of ``hot'' H$_3^+$ ($T_{\rm ex}\gtrsim$1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the emission of FUV-pumped H$_2$ and other ``PDR species'', such as CH$^+$, CH$_3^+$, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited H$_3^+$ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and, underscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of planet forming disks. They also demonstrate the power of JWST pushing the limit for the detection of elusive species in protoplanetary disks.
#### H3+ in irradiated protoplanetary disks: Linking far-ultraviolet radiation and hot water vapor

 - **Abstract**
 The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in the irradiated disk d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises the question of whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered star-forming regions, or if alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region (PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state dynamical calculations of reactions H2 + HOC+ -> H3+ + CO and H2 + H+ -> H2+ + H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited H2(v>=4), a process that has not previously been included in disk models. We find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization. The predicted H3+ abundance peaks at x(H3+)~10^-8, coinciding with regions where HOC+ is also abundant. The high abundances of H3+ and HOC+ are ultimately linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0), the presence of C+, and an enhanced reservoir of hot H2O. The predicted H3+ column densities (~10^13 cm^-2) are consistent with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of irradiated disks. We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+. We expect this photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G0 > 10^3. The H3+ formation pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.
