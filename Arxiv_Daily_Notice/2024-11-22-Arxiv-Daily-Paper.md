#### The Decline and Fall of ROME. V. A Preliminary Search for Star-Disrupted Planet Interactions and Coronal Activity at 5 GHz Among White Dwarfs within 25 pc

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs has renewed interest in the final chapters of the evolution of planetary systems. Although observational and theoretical studies have examined the dynamical evolution of these systems, studies of their magnetic star-planet interactions, as powered by unipolar induction, have thus far only been assessed theoretically. This fifth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted mini-survey of nine white dwarfs within 25 pc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated by magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants. This $\sim$5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity over $<$1 s integration times. Although no exoplanet-induced stellar radio flares were detected, this is the first survey to search for magnetic star-planet interactions between white dwarfs and planetary companions, cores, or disrupted planetesimals. It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio survey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs. The study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means to detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf coronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf magnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of planetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double degenerate merger events.

 - **Abstract**
 New emerging flux (NEF) has long been considered a mechanism for solar eruptions, but detailed process remains an open question. In this work, we explore how NEF drives a coronal magnetic configuration to erupt. This configuration is created by two magnetic sources of strengths $M$ and $S$ embedded in the photosphere, one electric-current-carrying flux rope (FR) floating in the corona, and an electric current induced on the photospheric surface by the FR. The source $M$ is fixed accounting for the initial background field, and $S$ changes playing the role of NEF. We introduce the channel function $C$ to forecast the overall evolutionary behavior of the configuration. Location, polarity, and strength of NEF governs the evolutionary behavior of FR before eruption. In the case of $|S/M|<1$ with reconnection occur between new and old fields, the configuration in equilibrium evolves to the critical state, invoking the catastrophe. In this case, if polarities of the new and old fields are opposite, reconnection occurs as NEF is close to FR; and if polarities are the same, reconnection happens as NEF appears far from FR. With different combinations of the relative polarity and the location, the evolutionary behavior of the system gets complex, and the catastrophe may not occur. If $|S/M|>1$ and the two fields have opposite polarity, the catastrophe always takes place; but if the polarities are the same, catastrophe occurs only as NEF is located far from FR; otherwise, the evolution ends up either with failed eruption or without catastrophe at all.
#### G321.93-0.01: A Rare Site of Multiple Hub-Filament Systems with Evidence of Collision and Merging of Filaments

 - **Abstract**
 Hub-filament systems (HFSs) are potential sites of massive star formation (MSF). To understand the role of filaments in MSF and the origin of HFSs, we conducted a multi-scale and multi-wavelength observational investigation of the molecular cloud G321.93-0.01. The $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) data reveal multiple HFSs, namely, HFS-1, HFS-2, and a candidate HFS (C-HFS). HFS-1 and HFS-2 exhibit significant mass accretion rates ($\dot{M}_{||}$ $> 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) to their hubs (i.e., Hub-1 and Hub-2, respectively). Hub-1 is comparatively massive, having higher $\dot{M}_{||}$ than Hub-2, allowing to derive a relationship $\dot{M}_{||} \propto M^{\beta}_{\rm{hub}}$, with $\beta \sim1.28$. Detection of three compact HII regions within Hub-1 using MeerKAT 1.28 GHz radio continuum data and the presence of a clump (ATL-3), which meets Kauffmann & Pillai's criteria for MSF, confirm the massive star-forming activity in HFS-1. We find several low-mass ALMA cores (1-9 $M_{\odot}$) inside ATL-3. The presence of a compact HII region at the hub of C-HFS confirms that it is active in MSF. Therefore, HFS-1 and C-HFS are in relatively evolved stages of MSF, where massive stars have begun ionizing their surroundings. Conversely, despite a high $\dot{M}_{||}$, the non-detection of radio continuum emission toward Hub-2 suggests it is in the relatively early stages of MSF. Analysis of $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) data reveals that the formation of HFS-1 was likely triggered by the collision of a filamentary cloud about 1 Myr ago. In contrast, the relative velocities ($\gtrsim 1$ km s$^{-1}$) among the filaments of HFS-2 and C-HFS indicate their formation through the merging of filaments.

 - **Abstract**
 The afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively discussed in the context of shocks generated during an interaction of relativistic outflows with their ambient medium. This process leads to the formation of both a forward and a reverse shock. While the emission from the forward shock, observed off-axis, has been well-studied as a potential electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave-detected merger, the contribution of the reverse shock is commonly overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of the reverse shock to the GRB afterglows observed off-axis. In our analysis, we consider jets with different angular profiles, including two-component jets, power-law structured jets, Gaussian jets and 'mixed jets' featuring a Poynting-flux-dominated core surrounded by a baryonic wing. We apply our model to GRB 170817A/GW170817 and employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to obtain model parameters. Our findings suggest that the reverse shock emission can significantly contribute to the early afterglow. In addition, our calculations indicate that the light curves observable in future off-axis GRBs may exhibit either double peaks or a single peak with a prominent feature, depending on the jet structure, viewing angle and micro-physics shock parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars lead the ionization and mechanical feedback within young star-forming regions. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal galaxy for studying individual massive stars and quantifying their feedback contribution to the environment. We analyze eight exemplary targets in LMC N11 B from the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program, using novel spectra from HST (COS and STIS) in the UV, and from VLT (X-shooter) in the optical. We model the spectra of early to late O-type stars by using state-of-the-art PoWR atmosphere models. We determine the stellar and wind parameters (e.g., $T_\star$, $\log g$, $L_{\star}$, $\dot{M}$, $v_\infty$) of the analyzed objects, chemical abundances (C, N, O), ionizing and mechanical feedback ($Q_\mathrm{H}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$, $L_\mathrm{mec}$) and X-rays. We report ages of $2-4.5$ Myr and masses of $30-60$ $M_\odot$ for the analyzed stars in N11 B, consistent with a scenario of sequential star formation. We note that the observed wind-momentum luminosity relation is consistent with theoretical predictions. We detect nitrogen enrichment in most of the stars, up to a factor of seven. However, we do not find a correlation between nitrogen enrichment and projected rotational velocity. Finally, based on their spectral type, we estimate the total ionizing photons injected from the O-type stars in N11 B into its environment. We report $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{H}$)$=50.5$ ph s$^{-1}$, $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$)$=49.6$ ph s$^{-1}$ and $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$)$=44.4$ ph s$^{-1}$, consistent with the total ionizing budget in N11.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how stellar feedback from the first stars (Population III) distributes metals through the interstellar and intergalactic medium using the star-by-star cosmological hydrodynamics simulation, Aeos. We find that energy injected from the supernovae of the first stars is enough to expel a majority of gas and injected metals beyond the virial radius of halos with mass $M_* \lesssim 10^7$ M$_\odot$, regardless of the number of supernovae. This prevents self-enrichment and results in a non-monotonic increase in metallicity at early times. Most minihalos ($M \gtrsim 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$) do not retain significant fractions of the yields produced within their virial radii until they have grown to halo masses of $M \gtrsim 10^7 \, \rm M_\odot$. The loss of metals to regions well beyond the virial radius delays the onset of enriched star formation and extends the period that Population III star formation can persist. We also explore the contributions of different nucleosynthetic channels to 10 individual elements. On the timescale of the simulation (lowest redshift $z=14.3$), enrichment is dominated by core-collapse supernovae for all elements, but with a significant contribution from asymptotic giant branch winds to the s-process elements, which are normally thought to only be important at late times. In this work, we establish important mechanisms for early chemical enrichment which allows us to apply Aeos in later epochs to trace the evolution of enrichment during the complete transition from Population III to Population II stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Examining reflected light from exoplanets aids in our understanding of the scattering properties of their atmospheres and will be a primary task of future flagship space- and ground-based telescopes. We introduce an enhanced capability of Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Scattering Observations (PICASO), an open-source radiative transfer model used for exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, to produce reflected light phase curves from three-dimensional atmospheric models. Since PICASO is coupled to the cloud code Virga, we produce phase curves for different cloud condensate species and varying sedimentation efficiencies (fsed) and apply this new functionality to Kepler-7b, a hot Jupiter with phase curve measurements dominated by reflected starlight. We model three different cloud scenarios for Kepler-7b: MgSiO3 clouds only, Mg2SiO4 clouds only, and Mg2SiO4, Al2O3, and TiO2 clouds. All our Virga models reproduce the cloudy region west of the substellar point expected from previous studies, as well as clouds at high latitudes and near the eastern limb, which are primarily composed of magnesium silicates. Al2O3 and TiO2 clouds dominate near the substellar point. We then compare our modeled reflected light phase curves to Kepler observations and find that models with all three cloud condensate species and low sedimentation efficiencies (0.03 - 0.1) match best, though our reflected light phase curves show intensities approximately one-third of those observed by Kepler. We conclude that a better understanding of zonal transport, cloud radiative feedback, and particle scattering properties is needed to further explain the differences between the modeled and observed reflected light fluxes.
#### A study of the star clusters' population in the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5

 - **Abstract**
 We study the structure, interstellar absorption, color-magnitude diagrams, kinematics, and dynamical state of embedded star clusters in the star-forming region associated with the giant molecular cloud G174+2.5. Our investigation is based on photometric data from the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey catalog and astrometric data from the Gaia DR3 catalogs. First, we recover all the known embedded clusters and candidate clusters in the region using surface density maps. Then, for the detected clusters, we determine their general parameters: the center positions, radii, number of stars, and reddening. To evaluate the reddening, we use both the NICEST algorithm and the Q-method. Both methods produce consistent extinction maps in the regions of the four studied clusters. However, the Q-method yields a much smaller color scatter in the CMD. For four clusters in particular (S235~North-West, S235~A-B-C, S235~Central, and S235~East1+East2), we were able to compute individual membership probabilities, the cluster distances, the cluster masses, and their average proper motions. By building on these results, we have studied the clusters' kinematics and dynamics. Moreover, we estimate the mass of the gas component and the star formation efficiency (SFE) in the regions of these four clusters. Finally, we provide an estimate of the total energy of the stellar and gas components in the area of these four clusters to determine whether the clusters are bound (here we consider a `cluster' as the system `stars + gas'). The gravitational bound strongly depends on the region for which we estimate the gas mass. If we consider the mass of the entire cloud, all these four clusters turn out to be bound.
#### Examining the evolution of the Supersoft X-ray Source RX J$0513.9-6951$

 - **Abstract**
 Supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) are thought to be accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in close binary systems, with thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. The SSS RX J$0513.9-6951$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibits cyclic variations between optical low and high states, which are anti-correlated with its X-ray flux. This behaviour is believed to result from the periodic expansion and contraction of the WD due to variations in the accretion rate in the system. We analyse eight high-resolution XMM and six grating Chandra spectra of RX J$0513.9-6951$ with our grid of model atmosphere spectra of hot WDs computed under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our aim is to test a contraction model of the source variability by tracking the evolution of the WD properties. The used grid of hot WD model atmospheres spans a wide range of effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}=100-1000\,\rm kK$ in steps of $25\,\rm kK$) and eight values of surface gravity $\log g$. The LMC chemical composition was assumed. The obtained fitting parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, and bolometric luminosity $L$) evolve on the $T_{\rm eff}- \log g$ and $T_{\rm eff}- L$ planes. This evolution follows the model tracks of WDs with masses of $1.05-1.15\,M_{\odot}$ and thermonuclear burning on the surface. The analysis has showed that the optical brightness of the system is lower when the WD is larger, more luminous, and more effectively illuminates the accretion disc. These results contradict the contraction model, which predicts the opposite behaviour of the source. We use a model, that assumes that the far UV/soft X-ray flux is reprocessed into the optical band due to multiple scattering in the cloud system above the accretion disc. More significant illumination can lead to rarefying of the cloud slab, thereby reducing the reprocessing efficiency and making the source fainter in the optical band.
