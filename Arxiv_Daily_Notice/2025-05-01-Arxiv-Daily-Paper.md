### Today: 5papers 
#### A New High-latitude H I Cloud Complex Entrained in the Northern Fermi Bubble
 - **Authors:** Rongmon Bordoloi, Andrew J. Fox, Felix J. Lockman
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21091

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21091

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of eleven high-velocity HI clouds at Galactic latitudes of 25-30 degrees, likely embedded in the Milky Way's nuclear wind. The clouds are detected with deep Green Bank Telescope 21 cm observations of a $3.2^\circ \times 6.2^\circ$ field around QSO 1H1613-097, located behind the northern Fermi Bubble. Our measurements reach $3\sigma$ limits on $ N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ as low as $3.1 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$, more than twice as sensitive as previous HI studies of the Bubbles. The clouds span $-180 \leq v_{\mathrm{LSR}} \leq -90$ km/s and are the highest-latitude 21 cm HVCs detected inside the Bubbles. Eight clouds are spatially resolved, showing coherent structures with sizes of 4-28 pc, peak column densities of $\log(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^2) = 17.9\text{-}18.7$, and HI masses up to 1470 $M_\odot$. Several exhibit internal velocity gradients. Their presence at such high latitudes is surprising, given the short expected survival times for clouds expelled from the Galactic Center. These objects may be fragments of a larger cloud disrupted by interaction with the surrounding hot gas.
#### DeepVoid: A Deep Learning Void Detector
 - **Authors:** Sam Kumagai, Michael S. Vogeley, Miguel A. Aragon-Calvo, Kelly A. Douglass, Segev BenZvi, Mark Neyrinck
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21134

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21134

 - **Abstract**
 We present DeepVoid, an application of deep learning trained on a physical definition of cosmic voids to detect voids in density fields and galaxy distributions. By semantically segmenting the IllustrisTNG simulation volume using the tidal tensor, we train a deep convolutional neural network to classify local structure using a U-Net architecture for training and prediction. The model achieves a void F1 score of 0.96 and a Matthews correlation coefficient over all structural classes of 0.81 for dark matter particles in IllustrisTNG with interparticle spacing of $\lambda=0.33 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$. We then apply the machine learning technique of curricular learning to enable the model to classify structure in data with significantly larger intertracer separation. At the highest tracer separation tested, $\lambda=10 h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$, the model achieves a void F1 score of 0.89 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.6 on IllustrisTNG subhalos.
#### Dust in the Smith Cloud? A UV Investigation into the Smith Cloud's Gas-Phase Abundance Patterns
 - **Authors:** Johanna Vazquez, Kathleen Barger, Frances Cashman, Andrew Fox, Bart Wakker, Felix Lockman, Alex Hill, Suraj Poudel, April Horton, Jaq Hernandez, Matthew Nuss, Alice Blake, Lauren Corlies, Molly Peeples
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21212

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21212

 - **Abstract**
 The Smith Cloud is a high-velocity cloud (HVC) on its final approach to the Milky Way that shows evidence of interaction with the Galaxy's disk. We investigate the metallicity and gas-phase chemical depletion patterns in this HVC using UV absorption-line observations toward two background QSOs taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) and H I 21-cm emission-line observations taken with Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We find evidence of silicon gas-phase depletion with [Si/S]$=\,-0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.24}$ and [Si/O]$_{3\sigma}\,\lesssim\,-0.05$, implying the presence of dust within the Smith Cloud. Because dust is galactic in origin, this HVC could trace the return leg of a Galactic fountain or a dwarf galaxy that passed through the Galactic plane.
#### JAvaScript Multimodal INformation Explorer
 - **Authors:** Fenja Schweder, Sebastian Trujillo-Gomez, Kai Polsterer
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21393

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21393

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical data is rich in volume, information and facets. Although this offers multiple research perspectives, processing the data remains a challenge. Infrastructures for analyzing, inspecting, exploring and communicating with data are mandatory. To address this issue, we introduce Jasmine, the JAvaScript Multimodal INformation Explorer. Jasmine allows users to open different data viewer modals that show a specific data point from a set. The viewer currently supports image data, as well as point cloud objects. Users can decide on which information about the data point they like to have displayed. Point clouds are interactive and allow for zooming, tossing, and turning. Picking a data point is enabled by providing a structured view of the set, arranged by a key property. This arrangement is achieved by autoencoding.
#### Compact stellar systems hosting an intermediate mass black hole: magnetohydrodynamic study of inflow-outflow dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole demographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar clusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts, where accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Yet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and metallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole accretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical abundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to explore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the accretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude relative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows driven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas. While enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense clumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The system's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds, masking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived, quasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these flares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our results naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters and provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared observational strategies.
