 - **Abstract**
 A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models is compared to recent NICER data of masses and radii. It is in particular interesting to capture the outlier XTE~J1814-338. Instead of integrating the TOV equations from the center to surface, we follow here another pathway by accommodating all uncertainties of the equation(s) of state (EoS) at supra-nuclear density or/and an unknown dark matter admixture in a parameterization of the core by its radius $r_x$, the included mass $m_x$ and the pressure $p_x$ at $r_x$. The corona, which may be dubbed also envelope or halo or outer crust, is assumed to be of standard-model matter where the EoS is supposed to be faithfully known.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90~GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z = 0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{15}~\rm M_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method for modelling the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24 \pm 4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and closely correlates spatially with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. The cluster center hosts shock fronts to the north and south, for which we report lower limits for the shock Mach numbers of $M = 1.6 \pm 0.4$ and $M = 1.9 \pm 0.3$, respectively. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $2.9_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$ keV and a density $(1.60\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of 150 relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim4.4\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim 6.8 \pm 2.7 \times 10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4-10\%.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of TOI-6303b and TOI-6330b, two massive transiting super-Jupiters orbiting a M0 and a M2 star respectively, as part of the Searching for GEMS survey. These were detected by TESS and then confirmed via ground-based photometry and radial velocity observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF). TOI-6303b has a mass of 7.84 +/- 0.31 MJ, a radius of 1.03 +/- 0.06 RJ , and an orbital period of 9.485 days. TOI-6330b has a mass of 10.00 +/- 0.31 MJ , a radius of 0.97 +/- 0.03 RJ , and an orbital period of 6.850 days. We put these planets in context of super-Jupiters around M-dwarfs discovered from radial-velocity surveys, as well as recent discoveries from astrometry. These planets have masses that can be attributed to two dominant planet formation mechanisms - gravitational instability and core-accretion. Their masses necessitate massive protoplanetary disks that should either be gravitationally unstable, i.e. forming through gravitational instability, or be amongst some of the most massive protoplanetary disks to form objects through core-accretion. We also discuss the eccentricity distribution of these objects, as a potential indicator of their formation and evolutionary mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Free electrons in the interstellar medium refract and diffract radio waves along multiple paths, resulting in angular and temporal broadening of radio pulses that limits pulsar timing precision. We determine multifrequency, multi-epoch scattering times for the large dispersion measure millisecond pulsar J1903+0327 by developing a three component model for the emitted pulse shape that is convolved with a best fit pulse broadening function (PBF) identified from a family of thin-screen and extended-media PBFs. We show that the scattering time, $\tau$, at a fiducial frequency of 1500 MHz changes by approximately 10% over a 5.5yr span with a characteristic timescale of approximately 100 days. We also constrain the spectral index and inner scale of the wavenumber spectrum of electron density variations along this line of sight. We find that the scaling law for $\tau$ vs. radio frequency is strongly affected by any mismatch between the true and assumed PBF or between the true and assumed intrinsic pulse shape. We show using simulations that refraction is a plausible cause of the epoch dependence of $\tau$, manifesting as changes in the PBF shape and $1/e$ time scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of our scattering results on pulsar timing including time of arrival delays and dispersion measure misestimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ever since they were first detected in the interstellar medium, the radio wavelength (3.3 GHz) hyperfine-structure splitting transitions in the rotational ground state of CH have been observed to show anomalous excitation. Astonishingly, this behaviour has been uniformly observed towards a variety of different sources probing a wide range of physical conditions. While the observed level inversion can be explained globally by a pumping scheme involving collisions, a description of the extent of 'over-excitation' observed in individual sources requires the inclusion of radiative processes, involving transitions at higher rotational levels. Therefore, a complete description of the excitation mechanism in the CH ground state, observed towards individual sources entails observational constraints from the rotationally excited levels of CH and in particular that of its first rotationally excited state. Given the limited detections of these lines, the objective of this work is to characterise the physical and excitation properties of the rotationally excited lines of CH near 700 MHz, and investigate their influence on the pumping mechanisms of the ground-state lines of CH. This work presents the first interferometric search for the rotationally excited lines of CH near 700 MHz carried out using the uGMRT array and jointly models the physical and excitation conditions traced by lines from both the ground and first rotationally excited states of CH.
#### Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently Skoutnev & Beloborodov (2024) revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a ``toggle switch" in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may be responsible for angular momentum transport. We implement such a ``toggle switch" in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in compositionally stratified regions, undermining the Tayler-Spruit dynamo as an explanation of the core-envelope coupling. In higher mass stars, the TI is active throughout the radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.
#### Quasi-steady evolution of fast neutrino-flavor conversions

 - **Abstract**
 In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 The jet may compress an interstellar medium and soft X-ray may be absorbed outside the jet by a compressed interstellar medium and thermal emission heated by a shock is expected inside the jet. I analyze X-ray image of surroundings of the jet of M87 by Chandra. There is an original work for image analysis. In this time, I select data for image by removal of pile up event completely. I confirm a dip in soft X-ray outside the jet between knot E and knot F with 260 ks archival data. I analyze X-ray energy spectra for knot E and knot F with 400 ks archival data by Chandra in order to search for thermal emission. However, X-ray energy spectra for knot E and knot F are well described with synchrtron emission.
#### The two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae: 2024 status report

 - **Abstract**
 In comparing the two alternative explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), I examine recent three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of CCSNe in the frame of the delayed-neutrino explosion mechanism (neutrino mechanism) and argue that these valuable simulations show that neutrino heating can supply a non-negligible fraction of the explosion energy but not the observed energies, hence cannot be the primary explosion mechanism. In addition to the energy crisis, the neutrino mechanism predicts many failed supernovae that are not observed. The most challenging issue of the neutrino mechanism is that it cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies of CCSN remnants, many of which were identified in 2024. These contradictions with observations imply that the neutrino mechanism cannot be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe. The alternative jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) seems to be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating boosts the energy of the jittering jets. Even if some simulations show explosions of stellar models (but usually with energies below observed), it does not mean that the neutrino mechanism is the explosion mechanism. Jittering jets, which simulations do not include, can explode the core before the neutrino heating process does. Morphological signatures of jets in many CCSN remnants suggest that jittering jets are the primary driving mechanism, as expected by the JJEM.
#### Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories

 - **Abstract**
 By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z > 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-driven galactic winds are multiphase outflows of energy and matter connecting the interstellar and circumgalactic media (CGM) with the intergalactic medium. Galactic winds contain a hot and diffuse phase detected in X-rays, and a cold and dense phase detected via emission and absorption lines from the ions populating the outflow. The ion production within galactic winds largely depends on the background UV radiation field produced by star formation, and this in turn depends on the age of the starburst, the gas metallicity, the proximity of the outflowing gas to the central star-forming regions. Our study probes the influence of the proximity of wind-cloud systems to the UV background source, and the effects of magnetic fields on the N V ion production through the analysis of synthetic column densities and spectral lines. We utilise magnetohydrodynamical simulations to study weakly-magnetised wind-cloud systems, and extract synthetic spectral lines with Trident and yt. Our simulations indicate that magnetic fields transverse to the wind have a shielding effect on dense gas, producing broader N V absorption lines. Also, a weak (distant) UV background produces N V only in the outer cloud layers with no spectral signature, while a strong (nearby) UV background produces it in the cloud core with a narrow spectral line. Overall, transverse magnetic fields and a UV radiation at 50 kpc produce the stronger N V spectral lines.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotational irregularities are one of the prominent observational features that most pulsars exhibit. These glitches, which are sudden increases in spin angular velocity, remains an open problem. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of nontrivial topological defects, specifically in the form of Nambu-goto-type CSs, and its connection to spin irregularities. Such CSs which are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various symmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the neutron stars. In this work, we see that the appearance of such topological defects trapped within the core can lead to the coupling of the string tension with the angular velocity, leading to the abrupt rotational changes observed as pulsar glitches. We have further studied how these coupling may generate detectable gravitational waves as a mixture of continuous and burst signals. The evolution of cusps of CSs trapped within neutron stars and the neutron star's mass quadruple moment change due to rotation could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures, well within the noise cutoff of advLIGO. Our study highlights a potential connection between topological defects, pulsar glitches, and gravitational wave emissions, offering a possible avenue for observationally testing the presence of CSs and their astrophysical effects.
#### ALMA Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP): Nested Morphological and Kinematic Structures of Outflows Revealed in SiO and CO Emission

 - **Abstract**
 The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) reveals complex nested morphological and kinematic features of molecular outflows through the CO (J = 2 - 1) and SiO (J = 5 - 4) emission. We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the ALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and G203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) parallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission exhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely-high-velocity (EHV) jets and shell-like low-velocity (LV) cavity walls and new features. More complex, nested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps, triangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions composed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs, are also evident. Such features find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified model of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on the PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic postshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed within the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission between the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These pseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jet-like knotty blobs, creating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is enhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jet-like excitation conditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures induced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle wind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.
