 - **Abstract**
 The Perseus complex offers an ideal testbed to study cluster formation and early evolution as it hosts two major hierarchical structures (namely LISCA I and LISCA II) and the W3/W4/W5 (W345) region characterized by recent star formation. This work aims to provide a full characterization of the population of star clusters in the W345 region, in terms of their structural, photometric, and kinematic properties. Clusters are then used to probe the dynamical properties of the W345 region and, on a larger scale, to investigate the evolution of the Perseus complex. We used Gaia DR3 data to search for star clusters in the W345 region and characterize them in terms of their density structure, ellipticity, internal dynamical state, and ages. We identified five stellar clusters belonging to the W345 complex. The three younger clusters are still partially embedded in the gas and show evidence of expansion, while the older ones cleared the surrounding gas. We also found that YSOs trace the parent gas structure and possibly its kinematics. Thanks to the 6D information available for star clusters, we followed their orbital evolution to assess the formation conditions and evolution of the complex. When accounting for the Galactic potential, we find that the Perseus complex is not dispersing. The observed expansion might be a projection effect due to stars orbiting the Galaxy at different velocities. In addition, we find that the LISCA I and W345 systems formed some $20-30$ Myr ago just a few hundred parsecs away, while LISCA II was originally $\simeq 0.75-1$ kpc apart. Finally, we also assessed the impact of spiral arm perturbations by constructing tailored Galactic potential which matches the observed Galactic spiral arm structure. We find spiral structures drag star clusters toward higher-density regions, possibly keeping clusters closer for longer than the unperturbed, axisymmetric case.
#### Uncertainties in the Inference of Internal Structure: The Case of TRAPPIST-1 f

 - **Abstract**
 We use the TRAPPIST-1 system as a model observation of Earth-like planets. The densities of these planets being 1-10% less than the Earth suggest that the outer planets may host significant hydrospheres. We explore the uncertainty in water mass fraction from observed mass and radius. We investigate the interior structure of TRAPPIST-1 f using the open-source solver MAGRATHEA and varying assumptions in the interior model. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f likely has a water mass fraction of 16.2% $\pm$ 9.9% when considering all possible core mass fractions and requires 6.9% $\pm$ 2.0% water at an Earth-like mantle to core ratio. We quantify uncertainties from observational precision, model assumptions, and experimental and theoretical data on the bulk modulus of planet building materials. We show that observational uncertainties are smaller than model assumptions of mantle mineralogy and core composition but larger than hydrosphere, temperature, and equation of state assumptions/uncertainties. Our findings show that while precise mass and radius measurements are crucial, uncertainties in planetary models can often outweigh those from observations, emphasizing the importance of refining both theoretical models and experimental data to better understand exoplanet interiors.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Dimethyl sulfide (DMS; CH$_3$SCH$_3$) is an organosulfur compound that has been suggested as a potential biosignature in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to its tentative detections toward the sub-Neptune planet K2-18b, DMS has been detected in the coma of the 67/P comet and toward the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. However, its formation routes have not been characterized yet. Aims: In this work, we have investigated three gas-phase reactions (CH$_3$SH + CH$_3$OH$_2^+$, CH$_3$OH + CH$_3$SH$_2^+$, and the CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association), aiming at characterizing DMS formation routes in shocked molecular clouds and star-forming regions. Methods: We have performed dedicated quantum and kinetics calculations to evaluate the reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature to be included in astrochemical models. Results: Among the investigated processes, the reaction between methanethiol (CH$_3$SH) and protonated methanol (CH$_3$OH$_2^+$)(possibly followed by a gentle proton transfer to ammonia) is a compelling candidate to explain the formation of DMS in the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association does not seem to be a very efficient process, with the exclusion of cold clouds, provided that the thiomethoxy radical (CH$_3$S) is available. This work does not deal directly with the possible formation of DMS in the atmosphere of exoplanets. However, it clearly indicates that there are efficient abiotic formation routes of this interesting species.
#### Supermassive Binaries in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16348

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.
#### Accretion Flow Properties of MAXI J1834-021 During Its Double-Outbursts In 2023

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16398

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic transient black hole candidate MAXI J1834-021 exhibited `faint' outbursting activity for approximately $10$ months following its discovery on February 5, 2023. We study the evolution of both the temporal (hard and soft band photon count rates, hardness ratios, and QPO frequencies) and spectral properties of the source using NICER data between March 7 and October 4, 2023. The outburst profile and the nature of QPOs suggest that the source underwent a mini-outburst following the primary outburst. A monotonic evolution of low-frequency QPOs from higher to lower frequencies is observed during the primary outbursting phase. Both phenomenological (diskbb plus powerlaw) and physical (Two Component Advective Flow) model fitted spectral studies suggest that during the entire epoch, the source remained in harder spectral states, with a clear dominance of nonthermal emissions from the `hot' Compton cloud. The 2023 outbursting activity of MAXI J1834$-$021 can be classified as a combination of double `failed' outbursts, as no softer spectral states were observed.
#### Detection of X-ray Polarization in the Hard State of IGR J17091-3624: Spectro-Polarimetric Study with IXPE and NuSTAR Data

 - **Abstract**
 The class-transition Galactic X-ray binary IGR J17091--3624 was simultaneously monitored by the IXPE and NuSTAR satellites. We present a detailed spectro-polarimetric study of the source using data from both satellites covering the period from March 7-10, 2025. A polarimetric analysis in the $2$-$8$~keV band using a model-independent method reveals a significant detection of polarization degree (PD) of $(11.3\pm2.35)\%$ at a polarization angle (PA) of $82^\circ.7\pm5^\circ.96$ (significant at $>4\sigma$). The model-dependent polarization analysis using the polconst and polpow models yields consistent values of PD and PA. In both methods, an energy-dependent increasing trend of PD is observed. In the $6$-$8$~keV band, a maximum PD of $(29.9\pm8.46)\%$ is detected at a PA of $88^\circ.0\pm8^\circ.15$ (significant at $>3\sigma$) . The joint spectral analysis using IXPE and NuSTAR data in the $2$-$70$~keV band was performed with four different sets of phenomenological and physical models. Our results indicate a strong dominance of non-thermal photons originating from a `hot' Compton cloud, suggesting that the source was in a hard spectral state. Spectral fitting with the physical kerrbb and TCAF models provides an estimate of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 14.8^{+4.7}_{-3.4}~M_\odot$ and dimensionless spin parameter $a^* \sim 0.54$.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio astronomy is part of radio science that developed rapidly in recent decades. In the research of radio astronomy, pulsars have always been an enduring popular research target. To find and observe more pulsars, large radio telescopes have been built all over the world. In this paper, we present our studies on pulsars in M15 and NGC 6517 with FAST, including monitoring pulsars in M15 and new pulsar discoveries in NGC 6517. All the previously known pulsars in M15 were detected without no new discoveries. Among them, M15C was still detectable by FAST, while it is assumed to fade out due to precession [1]. In NGC 6517, new pulsars were continues to be discovered and all of them are tend to be isolated pulsars. Currently, the number of pulsars in NGC 6517 is 17, much more than the predicted before [2].

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides a unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics. These systems are composed of a stellar-mass BH in a wide orbit around a non-degenerate star with no observed Xray emission. Inert BHBs allow for narrow constraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming core-collapse events. Aims. In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we aim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full parameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to characterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM project will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial velocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric observations of proper motions. Methods. We present a Bayesian parameter estimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse from inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the systemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The framework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are unavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved orbits. Results. With our new framework, we are able to distinguish between BH formation channels, even in the absence of a resolved orbit. In cases when the pre-explosion orbit can be assumed to be circular, we precisely recover the parameters of the core-collapse, highlighting the importance of understanding the eccentricity landscape of pre-explosion binaries, both theoretically and observationally. Treating the near-circular, inert BHB, VFTS 243, as a representative of the anticipated BLOeM systems, we constrain the natal kick to less than 27 km/s and the mass loss to less than 2.9 Msun within a 90% credible interval.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiometers are crucial instruments in radio astronomy, forming the primary component of nearly all radio telescopes. They measure the intensity of electromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A radiometer's primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), which is the core of the ``receiver'' chain. Instrumental effects introduced by the receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However, impedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted signal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as Dicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a well-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural networks, which are trained using known signal sources, provide a powerful means to model and calibrate complex systems where traditional analytical approaches struggle. These methods are especially relevant for detecting the faint sky-averaged 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen at high redshifts. This is one of the main challenges in observational Cosmology today. Here, for the first time, we introduce and test a machine learning-based calibration framework capable of achieving the precision required for radiometric experiments aiming to detect the 21-cm line.
#### The FAST Discovery of a Millisecond Pulsar Hidden in the Harmonics of PSR J2129+1210A (M15A)

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of an isolated millisecond pulsar M15O (J2129+1210O) from the globular cluster M15 (NGC 7078) with a period of $\sim$11.06686 ms and a dispersion measure of $\sim$67.44 cm$^{-3}$ pc. Its spin period is so close to the $10^{\text{th}}$ harmonic of the bright pulsar M15A ($\sim$11.06647 ms) and thus missed in previous pulsar search. We suggest adding the spectrum in the pulsar candidate diagnostic plot to identify new signals near the harmonics. M15O has the first spin frequency derivative and the second spin frequency derivative,being 1.79191(5) $\times$ $10^{-14}$ Hz $s^{-2}$ and 3.3133(6)$\times$ $10^{-23}$ Hz $s^{-3}$, respectively. Its projected distance from the optical centre of M15 is the closest among all the pulsars in M15. The origin can be something from the center of the massive and core-collapsed globular cluster M15.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic-ray air shower detection with the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope is envisioned to yield very high precision measurements of the particle composition of cosmic rays between $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ eV. This is made possible by the extreme antenna density of the core of SKA-Low, surpassing the current most dense radio air shower observatory LOFAR by over an order of magnitude. In order to make these measurements, the technical implementation of this observation mode and the development of reconstruction methods have to happen hand-in-hand. As a first lower limit of what is obtainable, we apply the current most precise reconstruction methods as used at LOFAR to a first complete simulation of air shower signals for the SKA-Low array. We describe this simulation setup and discuss the obtainable accuracy and resolution. A special focus is put on effects of the dynamic range of the system, beamforming methods to lower the energy threshold, as well as the limits to the mass composition accuracy given by statistical and systematic uncertainties.
