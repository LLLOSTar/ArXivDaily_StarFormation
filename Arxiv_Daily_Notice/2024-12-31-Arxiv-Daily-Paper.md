#### The effect of outflow launching radial efficiency of accretion disk on the shape of emission-line profiles

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the influence of radial behavior of disk outflow on the structure and dynamics of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with the emphasis on how the mass ejection rate contribute in shaping the broad emission line profiles. Specifically, we analyze how varying the radial efficiency of mass loss from accretion disks, driven by radiative dust-based mechanisms, contribute to the distribution of material in the BLR. By exploring different radial scenarios of disk mass loss behavior, we uncover connections between outflow radial efficiency and emission line profiles, particularly for lowly ionized lines. Our findings reveal that while the observed shape of broad emission lines is partially influenced by the radial behavior of the disk outflow, it ultimately depends more critically on the physical conditions of the clouds and the specific approach adopted to the emissivity for their contribution to the line formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) is a fundamental component of the Milky Way. Studying its chemical composition and the level of its chemical diversity gives us insight into the evolution of the Milky Way and the role of gas in the Galactic environment. In this paper, we use a novel simulation technique to model the distribution of total hydrogen between gas components, and therefore derive new constraints on the dust depletion and metallicity. We study individual gas components along the lines of sight towards eight bright O/B stars within 1.1 kpc of the Sun using high-resolution HST/STIS absorption spectra (R sim 114 000). We measure the level of dust depletion for these individual components and find components with higher levels of dust depletion compared to Milky Way sightlines in the literature. We find large ranges in the level of dust depletion among components along lines of sight, up to 1.19 dex. Although it is not possible to directly measure the metallicity of individual components due to the saturated and damped Ly-alpha line, we investigate possible metallicity ranges for individual gas components by exploring many different distributions of the total hydrogen gas between components. We select possible combinations of these gas fractions which produce the minimum metallicity difference between components, and for these cases we determine individual metallicities to accuracies that range between sim 0.1 to 0.4 dex. This work shows that full line-of-sight analyses wash out the level of diversity along lines of sight, and that component-by-component studies give a more in-depth understanding of the chemical intricacies of the interstellar medium.
#### Open cluster dissolution rate and the initial cluster mass function in the solar neighbourhood. Modelling the age and mass distributions of clusters observed by Gaia

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The dissolution rate of open clusters (OCs) and integration of their stars into the Milky Way's field population has been previously explored using their age distribution. With the advent of the Gaia mission, we have an exceptional opportunity to revisit and enhance these studies with ages and masses from high quality data. Aims. To build a comprehensive Gaia-based OC mass catalogue which, combined with the age distribution, allows a deeper investigation of the disruption experienced by OCs within the solar neighbourhood. Methods. Masses were determined by comparing luminosity distributions to theoretical luminosity functions. The limiting and core radii of the clusters were obtained by fitting the King function to their observed density profiles. We examined the disruption process through simulations of the build-up and mass evolution of a population of OCs which were compared to the observed mass and age distributions. Results. Our analysis yielded an OC mass distribution with a peak at $log(M)$ = 2.7 dex ($\sim 500 M_{\odot}$), as well as radii for 1724 OCs. Our simulations showed that using a power-law Initial Cluster Mass Function (ICMF) no parameters were able to reproduce the observed mass distribution. Moreover, we find that a skew log-normal ICMF provides a good match to the observations and that the disruption time of a $10^4 M{_\odot}$ OC is $t_4^{tot} = 2.9 \pm 0.4$ Gyr. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the OC disruption time $t_4^{tot}$ is about twice longer than previous estimates based solely on OC age distributions. We find that the shape of the ICMF for bound OCs differs from that of embedded clusters, which could imply a low typical star formation efficiency of $\leq 20\%$ in OCs. Our results also suggest a lower limit of $\sim 60 M{_\odot}$ for bound OCs in the solar neighbourhood.
#### Quasi-steady emission from repeating fast radio bursts can be explained by magnetar wind nebula
 - **Authors:** Mukul Bhattacharya, Kohta Murase, Kazumi Kashiyama

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19358

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19358

 - **Abstract**
 Among over 1000 known fast radio bursts (FRBs), only three sources - FRB 121102 (R1), FRB 190520 (R2) and FRB 201124 (R3) - have been linked to persistent radio sources (PRS). The observed quasi-steady emission is consistent with synchrotron radiation from a composite of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) and supernova (SN) ejecta. We compute the synchrotron flux by solving kinetic equations for energized electrons, considering electromagnetic cascades of electron-positron pairs interacting with nebular photons. For rotation-powered model, a young neutron star (NS) with age $t_{\rm age}\approx 20\,{\rm yr}$, dipolar magnetic field $B_{\rm dip}\approx (3-5)\times10^{12}\,{\rm G}$ and spin period $P_i\approx 1.5-3\,{\rm ms}$ in an ultra-stripped SN progenitor can account for emissions from R1 and R2. In contrast, R3 requires $t_{\rm age}\approx 10\,{\rm yr}$, $B_{\rm dip}\approx 5.5\times10^{13}\,{\rm G}$ and $P_i\approx 10\,{\rm ms}$ in a conventional core-collapse SN progenitor. For magnetar-flare-powered model, NS aged $t_{\rm age} \approx 25\,/40\,{\rm yr}$ in a USSN progenitor and $t_{\rm age} \approx 12.5\,{\rm yr}$ in a CCSN progenitor explains the observed flux for R1/R2 and R3, respectively. Finally, we constrain the minimum NS age $t_{\rm age,min} \sim 1-3\,{\rm yr}$ from the near-source plasma contribution to observed DM, and $t_{\rm age,min} \sim 6.5-10\,{\rm yr}$ based on the absence of radio signal attenuation.
#### Signatures of Core-Envelope Rotational Misalignment in the Mixed-Mode Asteroseismology of Kepler-56

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19451

 - **Abstract**
 Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate around a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or their possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope out of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive perturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto unexamined rotational configurations, under the ``shellular approximation'' of constant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned case, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by the inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes this to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the phenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red giants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical degeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology that results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56 -- a red giant with a misaligned planetary system -- I find that its core and envelope rotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core is indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets (consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to lying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed asteroseismic modelling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully elucidate the full spin-orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially discriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.
#### Magnetic fields on different spatial scales of the L328 cloud

 - **Abstract**
 L328 core has three sub-cores S1, S2, and S3, among which the sub-core S2 contains L328-IRS, a Very Low Luminosity Object (VeLLO), which shows a CO bipolar outflow. Earlier investigations of L328 mapped cloud/envelope (parsec-scale) magnetic fields (B-fields). In this work, we used JCMT/POL-2 submillimeter (sub-mm) polarisation measurements at 850 $\mu$m to map core-scale B-fields in L328. The B-fields were found to be ordered and well-connected from cloud to core-scales, i.e., from parsec- to sub-parsec-scale. The connection in B-field geometry is shown using $Planck$ dust polarisation maps to trace large-scale B-fields, optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarisation observations to trace B-fields in the cloud and envelope, and 850 $\mu$m polarisation mapping core-scale field geometry. The core-scale B-field strength, estimated using the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi relation, was found to be 50.5 $\pm$ 9.8 $\mu$G, which is $\sim$2.5 times higher than the envelope B-field strength found in previous studies. This indicates that B-fields are getting stronger on smaller (sub-parsec) scales. The mass-to-flux ratio of 1.1 $\pm$ 0.2 suggests that the core is magnetically transcritical. The energy budget in the L328 core was also estimated, revealing that the gravitational, magnetic, and non-thermal kinetic energies were comparable with each other, while thermal energy was significantly lower.
