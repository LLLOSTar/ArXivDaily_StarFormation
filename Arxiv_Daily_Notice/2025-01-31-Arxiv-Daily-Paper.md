 - **Abstract**
 The proximity & low dust extinction of the Magellanic Clouds provides an ideal environment for metal-poor massive stars to be studied in detail. The HST ULLYSES initiative has provided exquisite ultraviolet spectroscopy of a large sample of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, and its legacy value has been enhanced through the acquisition of optical VLT/XShooter spectroscopy (XShootU). We aim to determine the spectral types and physical properties of 122 LMC & 103 SMC OB stars observed via XShootU. Physical parameters are required for these to serve as templates in spectral libraries of metal poor massive stars. We also aim to identify double-lined binaries and OeBe stars for which analysis requires non-standard treatment. We apply a pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of hot luminous stars to XShootU spectroscopic datasets, together with grids of synthetic model spectra computed with the non-LTE atmospheric code fastwind at LMC & SMC metallicities. We determine physical and wind properties of 97 LMC & 77 SMC massive stars, ranging from O2 to B9 subtypes, representing the majority of the XShootU OB sample (OeBe & candidate SB2 systems are excluded). Results are broadly in agreement with previous optical spectroscopic studies, with evolutionary masses spanning 12-117 Msun in the LMC & 11-74 Msun in the SMC. We determine a revised Teff-spectral type calibration for Magellanic Cloud stars, identify stars with peculiar radial velocities, and compare wind properties of high luminosity O stars with dense winds, revealing ~0.27 dex higher wind momenta of LMC stars with respect to SMC counterparts. Incorporating the recent empirical metallicity dependence of Z^0.22 for wind velocities, this suggests a mass-loss dependence of Z^0.5 for luminous O stars. Studies incorporating ultraviolet mass-loss diagnostics are required for OB stars with weak winds and/or low luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust grains play a crucial role in the modeling of protostellar formation, particularly through their opacity and interaction with the magnetic field. The destruction of dust grains in numerical simulations is currently modeled primarily by temperature dependent functions. However, a dynamical approach could be necessary to accurately model the vaporization of dust grains. We focused on modeling the evolution of dust grains during star formation, specifically on the vaporization of the grains by chemisputtering. We also investigated the evolution of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic resistivities and the Planck and Rosseland mean opacities influenced by the grain evolution. We modeled the evolution of the dust by considering spherical grains at thermal equilibrium with the gas phase, composed only of one kind of material for each grain. We then took into account the exchange processes that can occur between the grains and the gas phase and that make the grain size evolve. We considered three materials for the grains: carbon, silicate, and aluminum oxide. Given a temporal evolution in temperature and density of the gas phase, we computed the evolution of a dust grain distribution. We observed a significant dependence of the sublimation temperature of the carbon grains on the dynamical evolution of the gas phase. The application of our method to trajectories where the temperature and density of the gas decrease after the sublimation of a portion of the grain distribution highlights the limitations of current vaporization prescriptions in simulations. The dynamical approach leads to more accurate results for the carbon grain quantity when the temperature and density of the gas evolve quickly. The dynamical approach application to collapse and disk evolution is then foreseen with its integration into hydrodynamic simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the small-scale spatial variation in cool ($T\sim 10^4 K$) Mg II absorption detected in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a star-forming galaxy at $z\approx 0.8$. The CGM of this galaxy is probed by a spatially extended bright background gravitationally lensed arc at $z = 2.76$. The background arc continuously samples the CGM of the foreground galaxy at a range of impact parameters between 54-66 kpc. The Mg II absorption strengths vary by more than a factor of two within these ranges. A power-law fit to the fractional variation of absorption strengths yields a coherence length of 2.7 kpc within these absorption lines. This suggests a high degree of spatial coherence in the CGM of this galaxy. The host galaxy is driving a strong galactic outflow with a mean outflow velocity $\approx$ -179 km/s and mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{out}\geq 64_{-27}^{+31} M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ traced by blueshifted Mg II and Fe II absorption lines. The galaxy itself has a spatially extended emission halo with a maximum spatial extent of $\approx$ 33 kpc traced by [O II], [O III] and $H\beta$ emission lines. The extended emission halo shows kinematic signatures of co-rotating halo-gas with solar metallicity. Taken together, these observations suggest evidence of a baryon cycle that is recycling the outflowing gas to form the next generation of stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex organic molecules (COMs) are widely detected in protostellar and protoplanetary systems, where they are thought to have been inherited in large part from earlier evolutionary phases. The chemistry of COMs in these earlier phases, namely starless and prestellar cores, remains poorly understood, as models often struggle to reproduce the observed gas-phase abundances of these species. We simulate the formation of a molecular cloud, and the cores within it, out of the diffuse interstellar medium, and follow the chemical evolution of the cloud material starting from purely-atomic initial conditions. We find that the formation of both gas- and ice-phase COMs precedes the formation of cores as distinct objects, beginning at gas densities of a few $10^3 \,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. Much of this COM-enriched material remains at these relatively modest densities for several Myr, which may provide a reservoir for accretion onto planet-forming discs in later evolutionary stages. We suggest that models of core and disc chemistry should not ignore the complex dynamical evolution which precedes these structures, even when studying supposedly late-forming molecules such as CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN.
#### Into the Mystic: the MUSE view of the ionized gas in the Mystic Mountains in Carina

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical integral field unit (IFU) observations of the Mystic Mountains, a dust pillar complex in the center of the Carina Nebula that is heavily irradiated by the nearby young massive cluster Trumpler 14. With the continuous spatial and spectral coverage of data from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we measure the physical properties in the ionized gas including the electron density and temperature, excitation, and ionization. MUSE also provides an excellent view of the famous jets HH 901, 902, and 1066, revealing them to be high-density, low-ionization outflows despite the harsh environment. HH 901 shows spatially extended [C I] emission tracing the rapid dissociation of the photoevaporating molecular outflow in this highly irradiated source. We compute the photoevaporation rate of the Mystic Mountains and combine it with recent ALMA observations of the cold molecular gas to estimate the remaining lifetime of the Mystic Mountains and the corresponding shielding time for the embedded protostars. The longest remaining lifetimes are for the smallest structures, suggesting that they have been compressed by ionizing feedback. Our data do not suggest that star formation in the Mystic Mountains has been triggered but it does point to the role that ionization-driven compression may play in enhancing the shielding of embedded stars and disks. Planet formation models suggest that the shielding time is a strong determinant of the mass and orbital architecture of planets, making it important to quantify in high-mass regions like Carina that represent the type of environment where most stars form.
#### Unusual X-ray Oxygen Line Ratios of SN 1987A Arising From the Absorption of Galactic Hot Interstellar Medium

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed unusual oxygen line ratios, such as the high O VII forbidden-to-resonance ratio, in several supernova remnants. While the physical origin is still under debate, for most of them, it has been suggested that this phenomenon arises from either charge exchange (CX) or resonant scattering (RS). In this work, we report the high O VII G-ratio ($\gtrsim1$) and high O VIII Ly$\beta$/Ly$\alpha$ ratio ($\gtrsim0.2$) found in multiepoch XMM-Newton RGS observations of SN 1987A. The line ratios cannot be fully explained by non-equilibrium ionization effects, CX, or RS. We suggest the absorption of foreground hot gas as the most likely origin, which plays the major role in modifying line fluxes and line ratios. Based on this scenario, we introduced two Gaussian absorption components at the O VII resonance line and the O VIII Ly$\alpha$ line and constrained the optical depth of the two lines as $\tau_{\rm OVII}\sim0.6$ and $\tau_{\rm OVIII}\sim0.2$. We estimated the temperature as $kT_{\rm e}\sim0.18$ keV and the oxygen column density as $N_{\rm O}\sim0.8\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the absorbing gas, which is consistent with the hot interstellar medium in the Galactic halo. Neglecting this absorption component may lead to an underestimation {of} the O abundance. We revised the O abundance of SN 1987A, which is increased by $\sim20\%$ compared with previous results. The N/O ratio by number of atoms is revised to be $\sim1.2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the baryonic matter density parameter, $\Omega_b$, within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our analysis utilizes observational data on the effective optical depth from high-redshift quasars. To parameterize the photoionization rate $\Gamma_{-12}$, we employ a Bézier polynomial. Additionally, we approximate the Hubble parameter at high redshifts as $H(z)\approx 100h\Omega_m^{1/2} (1+z)^{3/2}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Confidence regions are obtained with $h=0.701\pm0.013$ and $\Omega_m = 0.315$, optimized by the Planck mission. The best-fit values are $\Omega_b =0.043^{+0.005}_{-0.006}$ and $\Omega_b = 0.045^{+0.004}_{-0.006}$, corresponding to an old data set and a new data set, respectively. And we test the non-parametric form of $\Gamma_{-12}$, obtaining $\Omega_b = 0.048^{+0.001}_{-0.003}$. These results are consistent with the findings of Planck at the 1 $\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of quasar datasets in constraining $\Omega_b$, eliminating the need for independent photoionization rate data. This approach provides detailed cosmic information about baryon density and the photoionization history of the intergalactic medium.
#### An examination of large-scale galactic effects on molecular cloud properties in NGC 628 : The significant impact of tidal effects from neighboring material on the evolution of molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 The physical factors that influence the development of molecular cloud's density contrast are connected to those that affect star formation in the galaxy. For NGC 628 (M74), the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds initially increases with the distance to the galactic center ($R_{G}$) and then keeps relatively stable. Spiral arms, bubbles and magnetic fields are not responsible for the variations in density contrast observed among molecular clouds. The effects of shear and tides calculated from the galactic rotation curve consistently decrease as $R_{G}$ increases, and the shear effect can be neglected. We further studied the tidal effects of the neighboring material on each cloud using the tidal tensor analysis and the pixel-by-pixel computation, after combining molecular gas, atomic gas and stellar mass surface density maps. When $R_{\rm G} <$ 4 kpc, the tidal strengths derived from the pixel-by-pixel computation decrease as $R_{\rm G}$ increases, and then remains relatively constant when $R_{\rm G} >$ 4 kpc. This aligns well with the dependence of the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds on $R_{\rm G}$. Therefore, the tidal effects of neighboring material have a significant impact on the development of molecular cloud's density contrast. A key factor contributing to the low star formation rate in the galactic center is the excessive tidal influences from neighboring material on molecular clouds, which hinder the gravitational collapse within these clouds, resulting in low density contrasts. The tidal effects from neighboring material may also be a significant contributing factor to the slowing down of a pure free-fall gravitational collapse for gas structures on galaxy-cloud scales revealed in our previous works by velocity gradient measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: How planets form in protoplanetary disks and what drives the formation of their seeds is still a major unknown. It is an accepted theory that multiple processes can trap dusty material in radially narrow rings or vortex-like structures, preventing the dust from drifting inwards. However, the relevant process for clumping this dusty material until it collapses under gravity still needs to be identified. One promising candidate is the streaming instability arising from the aerodynamic interaction between dust and gas once they reach similar densities. Aims: We investigate with a global disk model based on recent observational constraints if streaming instability can form dust clumps, which might gravitationally collapse. Further, our goal is to verify the observability of the produced structures using ALMA or ngVLA. Methods. For the first time, we present global 2D (R, z) hydrodynamic simulations using FARGO3D in which the dust is treated as a pressureless fluid. The disk model assumes stratification, realistic boundary conditions, and meaningful resolution to resolve the fast-growing modes. We choose two values for the total dust-to-gas mass ratio Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02, compare the maximum clump density to the local Hill density, and compute the optical depth of the dust disk. Results: With a dust-to-gas mass ratio of Z = 0.01, we confirm previous streaming instability simulations, not showing the ability to form strong concentrations of dust clumps. With Z = 0.02, dense clumps form within 20 orbits, however reaching only 30% of the Hill density even following disk parameters from the massive protoplanetary disks GM Aur, HD163296, IM Lup, MWC 480, and TW Hya, which all share astonishingly similar surface density profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of the isotopic ratio of interstellar nitrogen -- $^{14}$N versus $^{15}$N -- is done, for explaining its variations observed for N2H+ in different interstellar and Solar environments. The goal is to produce cross sections and rate coefficients for electron impact dissociative recombination for different isotopologues of N$_2$H$^+$, since it was envisioned as a novel source that can lead to nitrogen fractionation. We calculate dissociative recombination cross sections and rate coefficients using the normal mode approximation combined with the R-matrix theory and vibronic frame transformation within the multichannel quantum defect theory for eight isotopologues containing both $^{14}$N, $^{15}$N and H, D. Our calculations show that the relative differences respective to the main isotopologue ($^{14}$N$_2$H$^+$) is below 1% for the hydrogen containing isotopologues, but reaches almost 30% for the heaviest deuterated isotopologue, leading us to the conclusion that according to the present status of the theory, dissociative recombination is not responsible for the peculiar $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N isotopic ratios of N$_2$H$^+$ observed in the different interstellar molecular clouds.
#### Variability of the UV luminosity function with SPICE

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the variability of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) at $z > 5$ using the SPICE suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which include three distinct supernova (SN) feedback models: bursty-sn, smooth-sn, and hyper-sn. The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN explosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR). Conversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results in minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic prescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate variability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts. These fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$ relation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces the highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the smooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with maximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF variability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos showing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their shallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher amplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift for all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN feedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence of its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright galaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.
