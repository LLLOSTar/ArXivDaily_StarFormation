#### The formation of multiples in small-$N$ subclusters

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the relative percentages of binary systems and higher-order multiples that are formed by pure stellar dynamics, within a small subcluster of $N$ stars. The subcluster is intended to represent the fragmentation products of a single isolated core, after most of the residual gas of the natal core has dispersed. Initially the stars have random positions, and masses drawn from a log-normal distribution. For low-mass cores spawning multiple systems with Sun-like primaries, the best fit to the observed percentages of singles, binaries, triples and higher-order systems is obtained if a typical core spawns on average between $N=$ 4.3 and 5.2 stars, specifically a distribution of $N$ with mean $\mu_{_{N}}\sim4.8$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{_N}\sim2.4$. This fit is obtained when $\sim 50\%$ of the subcluster's internal kinetic energy is invested in ordered rotation and $\sim 50\%$ in isotropic Maxwellian velocities. There is little dependence on other factors, for example mass segregation or the rotation law. Whilst such high values of $N$ are at variance with the lower values often quoted (i.e. $N=$ 1 or 2), very similar values ($N=4.3\pm0.4$ and $N=4.5\pm1.9$) have been derived previously by completely independent routes, and seem inescapable when the observed distribution of multiplicities is taken into account.
#### The impact of the cosmological constant on past and future star formation
 - **Authors:** Daniele Sorini, John A. Peacock, Lucas Lombriser
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

 - **Abstract**
 We present an extended analytic model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat $\Lambda$CDM models where the cosmological constant varies between $\Lambda = 0$ and $10^5$ times the observed value, $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at $\sim$27% for $0.01 \lesssim \Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs} \lesssim 1$. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star-formation efficiency for lower and higher values of $\Lambda$ is driven respectively by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as $\Lambda$ increases, falling below 5% only for $\Lambda>100 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on $\Lambda$, the median posterior value of $\Lambda$ is $539 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Furthermore, the probability of observing $\Lambda\leq \Lambda_{\rm obs}$ is only $0.5\%$. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with $\Lambda<0$, the indication is thus that $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$ appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble. This poses a challenge for anthropic reasoning as a viable explanation for cosmic coincidences and the apparent fine-tuning of the universe: either the approach is invalid, or more parameters than $\Lambda$ alone must vary within the ensemble.
#### Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse
 - **Authors:** Sanghyuk Moon, Eve C. Ostriker
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07349

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07349

 - **Abstract**
 A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.
#### Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores
 - **Authors:** Sanghyuk Moon, Eve C. Ostriker

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07350

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of the dense cores that form within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. To this end, here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of ``critical cores'' that are on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion constructed for individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While there exists a global linewidth--size relation for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations constructed around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse, but instead cores collapse at a wide range of densities determined by the local sonic scale, modulated by the local gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores found in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the average properties of a turbulent cloud. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.
#### Monitoring of DDO68 'Northern Ring' SF regions during years 2016-2023

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07393

 - **Abstract**
 DDO68 is a star-forming (SF) dwarf galaxy residing in a nearby void. Its gas metallicity is among the lowest known in the local Universe, with parameter 12+log(O/H) in the range of 6.96-7.3 dex. Six of its SF regions are located in or near the so-called 'Northern Ring', in which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images reveal many luminous young stars. We present for these SF regions (Knots) the results of optical monitoring in 35 epochs during the years 2016--2023. The data was acquired with the 6m (BTA) and the 1m telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and the 2.5m telescope of the MSU Caucasian Mountain Observatory. We complement the above results with the archive data from 10 other telescopes for 11 epochs during the years 1988-2013 and with 3 our BTA observations between 2005 and 2015. Our goal is to search for variability of these Knots and to relate it to the probable light variations of their brightest stars. One of them, DDO68-V1 (in Knot 3), was identified in 2008 with a luminous blue variable (LBV) star, born in the lowest metallicity environments. For Knot 3, variations of its integrated light in the previous epochs reached ~0.8 mag. In the period since 2016, the amplitude of variations of Knot 3 reached ~0.3 mag. For the rest Knots, due to the lower amplitudes, the manifestation of variability is less pronounced. We examine the presence of variability via the criterion chi^{2} and the Robust Median Statistics and discuss the robustness of the detected variations. The variability is detected according to the both criteria in the lightcurves of all Knots with the chi^{2} confidence level of alpha = 0.0005. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of variations are ~0.09, ~0.13, ~0.11, ~0.08 and ~0.16 mag for Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The amplitudes of the related variations of the brightest supergiants in these regions can reach of ~3.0 mag.

 - **Abstract**
 Binarity plays a crucial role in star formation and evolution. Consequently, identifying binary stars is essential to deepen our understanding of these processes. We propose a method to investigate the observed radial velocity distribution of massive stars in young clusters with the goal of identifying binary systems. We reconstruct the radial velocity distribution using a three-layers hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric approach: non-parametric methods are data-driven models able to infer arbitrary probability densities under minimal mathematical assumptions. When applying our statistical framework, it is possible to identify variable stars and binary systems because these deviate significantly from the expected intrinsic Gaussian distribution for radial velocities. We test our method with the massive star forming region within the giant H$_\mathrm{II}$ region M17. We are able to confidently identify binaries and variable stars with as little as single-epoch observations. The distinction between variable and binary stars improves significantly when introducing additional epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present deep JWST/NIRSpec integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and ALMA [CII]$\lambda$158$\mu$m observations of COS-3018, a star-forming galaxy at z$\sim$6.85, as part of the GA-NIFS programme. Both G395H (R$\sim$ 2700) and PRISM (R$\sim$ 100) NIRSpec observations revealed that COS-3018 is comprised of three separate components detected in [OIII]$\lambda$5008, which we dub as Main, North and East, with stellar masses of 10$^{9.4 \pm 0.1}$, 10$^{9.2 \pm 0.07}$, 10$^{7.7 \pm 0.15}$ M$_{\odot}$. We detect [OIII]$\lambda$5008, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$3727,29 and multiple Balmer lines in all three components together with [OIII]$\lambda$4363 in the Main and North components. This allows us to measure an ISM temperature of T$_{e}$= 1.27$\pm0.07\times 10^4$ and T$_{e}$= 1.6$\pm0.14\times 10^4$ K with densities of $n_{e}$ = 1250$\pm$250 and $n_{e}$ = 700$\pm$200 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. These deep observations allow us to measure an average metallicity of 12+log(O/H)=7.9--8.2 for the three components with the T$_{e}$-method. We do not find any significant evidence of metallicity gradients between the components. Furthermore, we also detect [NII]$\lambda$6585, one of the highest redshift detections of this emission line. We find that in a small, metal-poor clump 0.2 arcsec west of the North component, N/O is elevated compared to other regions, indicating that nitrogen enrichment originates from smaller substructures, possibly proto-globular clusters. [OIII]$\lambda$5008 kinematics show that this system is merging, which is probably driving the ongoing, luminous starburst.

 - **Abstract**
 Following the discovery of several ocean worlds in the solar system, and the selection of Uranus as the highest priority objective by the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, the five largest moons of Uranus (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon) have been receiving renewed attention as they may also harbor a subsurface ocean. We assess how rotation measurements could help confirm the internal differentiation of the bodies and detect internal oceans if any. Because of the time-varying gravitational torque of Uranus on the flattened shape of its synchronous satellites, the latter librate with respect to their mean rotation and precess with a non zero obliquity. For a range of interior models with a rocky core surrounded by a hydrosphere, either solid or divided into an outer ice shell with a liquid ocean underneath, we compute their diurnal libration amplitude and obliquity.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been detected throughout the universe where they play essential roles in the evolution of their environments. For example, they are believed to affect atmospheric loss rates of close-in planets and might contribute to the pre-biotic chemistry and emergence of life. Despite their importance, the study of PAHs in exoplanet atmospheres has been limited. We aim to evaluate the possibility of detecting PAHs on exoplanets considering future observations using JWST's NIRSpec PRISM mode. The hot Saturn WASP-6 b shows properties that are consistent with a potential PAH presence and is thus used as a case study for this work. Here, we compare the likelihoods of various synthetic haze species and their combinations with the influence of PAHs on the transmission spectrum of WASP-6 b. This is possible by applying the atmospheric retrieval code petitRADTRANS to a collection of data from previous observations. Subsequently, by exploring synthetic, single transit JWST spectra of this planet that include PAHs, we assess if these molecules can be detected in the near future. Previous observations support the presence of cloud/haze species in the spectrum of WASP-6 b. While this may include PAHs, the current data do not confirm their existence unambiguously. Our research suggests that utilizing the JWST for future observations could lead to a notable advancement in the study of PAHs. Employing this telescope, we find that a PAH abundance of approximately 0.1 per cent of the ISM value could be robustly detectable.
#### Bidirectional propagating brightenings in arch filament systems observed by Solar Orbiter/EUI

 - **Abstract**
 Arch filament systems (AFSs) are chromospheric and coronal manifestations of emerging magnetic flux. Using high spatial resolution observations taken at a high cadence by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter, we identified small-scale elongated brightenings within the AFSs. These brightenings appear as bidirectional flows along the threads of AFSs. For our study, we investigated the coordinated observations of the AFSs acquired by the EUI and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO on 2022 March 4 and 17. We analyzed 15 bidirectional propagating brightenings from EUI 174 Å images. These brightenings reached propagating speeds of 100-150 km/s. The event observed on March 17 exhibits blob-like structures, which may be signatures of plasmoids and due to magnetic reconnection. In this case, we also observed counterparts in the running difference slit-jaw images in the 1400 Å passbands taken by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Most events show co-temporal intensity variations in all AIA EUV passbands. Together, this implies that these brightenings in the AFSs are dominated by emission from cool plasma with temperatures well below 1 MK. The magnetograms taken by the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) on board Solar Orbiter show signatures of flux emergence beneath the brightenings. This suggests that the events in the AFSs are triggered by magnetic reconnection that may occur between the newly emerging magnetic flux and the preexisting magnetic field structures in the middle of the AFSs. This would also give a natural explanation for the bidirectional propagation of the brightenings near the apex of the AFSs. The interaction of the preexisting field and the emerging flux may be important for mass and energy transfer within the AFSs.
#### The impact of water clouds on the prospective emission spectrum of Teegarden's Star b as observed by LIFE

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07922

 - **Abstract**
 Non-transiting terrestrial planets will be accessible by upcoming observatories of which LIFE is an example. Planet b orbiting Teegarden's Star is one of the optimal targets for such missions. We use a one-dimensional atmospheric model with real-gas radiation, a multi-species pseudo-adiabatic convection-condensation scheme, and a water cloud scheme, to estimate the impact of the cloud coverage on the emission spectrum of the target, as well as to assess how sensitive LIFE could be to changes in outgoing flux caused by these clouds. Though the emergent flux decreases with a higher cloud coverage, it does not decrease by more than one order of magnitude as the coverage increases from 0% to 90%. This allows LIFE to retain a high sensitivity to the cloud cover fraction for wavelengths longer than 7 microns. In this spectral range, with at least 1 bar of N2, LIFE is able to distinguish cloud cover fractions as small as 10% given an integration time of 24 hours, and yields much better precision with a week-long integration. An integration time of one week also allows the resolution of local variations in spectral flux, which can lead to an easier molecule identification. This ability remains if the planet is a CO2-dominated Venus analog. Partial pressures of N2 lower than 1 bar may create a degeneracy with the cloud cover fraction. LIFE shows promising potential for detecting and characterizing atmospheres even with a high cloud coverage, and retaining a fine sensitivity to relatively small differences in cloud cover fractions.
#### Et tu, Brute?: The Crab Nebula also exploded by jittering jets

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a point-symmetrical morphology comprised of seven pairs of opposite bays in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant Crab Nebula, which is consistent with the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. We use a recently published infrared image of the Crab Nebula and apply image analysis to fit seven pairs of bays in the Crab, each pair of two bays and a symmetry axis connecting them. The seven symmetry axes intersect close to the explosion site, forming a point-symmetrical structure. We explain the bays as clumps that move slower than the low-density ejecta that the pulsar accelerated. Jittering jets that exploded the Crab formed the clumps during the explosion process. This shows that jittering jets explode even very low-energy CCSNe, as the Crab is, adding to the solidification of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.
