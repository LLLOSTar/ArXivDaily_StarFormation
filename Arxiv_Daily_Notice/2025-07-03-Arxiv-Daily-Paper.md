 - **Abstract**
 One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1<20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.

 - **Abstract**
 The astrophysical origin of elements synthesized through the rapid neutron capture process ($r-$process) is a long standing mystery. The hot and dense environments of core-collapse supernovae have been suggested as potential $r-$process sites, particularly the neutrino-driven wind from the newly-born protoneutron star (PNS). Wind models that neglect the potential effects of strong magnetic fields and/or rapid rotation of the PNS typically fail to achieve the necessary conditions for production of the third $r-$process peak, but robustly produce a limited or weak $r-$process for neutron-rich winds. Axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of rotating and non-rotating PNS winds with magnetar-strength fields reveal that high entropy material is quasi-periodically ejected from the equatorial closed zone of the PNS magnetosphere. Here, we post-process tracer particle trajectories from these simulations using a nuclear reaction network in order to explore the resulting nucleosynthesis across a range of PNS magnetic field strengths, rotation rates, and neutrino luminosities (cooling phase after core-bounce). We find that a robust $r-$process up to and beyond the third peak is generic to magnetar birth, even for magnetic fields as weak as $\sim 5\times 10^{14}$ G. Depending on the distribution of magnetic field strengths and rotation at birth, we estimate that magnetized PNS winds could account for $\sim 5-100\%$ of the Galactic $r-$process inventory, extending up to the third peak. The robust $r-$process in our calculations is accompanied by overproduction of elements with mass number $\rm A\lesssim 120$ compared to the Solar abundances. We also find that $^{92}\rm Mo$ (a $p-$isotope) is produced in significant quantities in neutron-rich winds.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the effects of the neutrino collisional flavor instability (CFI) based on 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done using the sophisticated radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc ornax}. We compare the growth rates of homogeneous CFI {(hCFI)} modes calculated by numerically solving the multi-group dispersion relation to those calculated using the monochromatic approximation. We find that the widely-used monochromatic approximation {leads to incorrect growth rates} when applied in multi-group scenarios. {As opposed to the $\sim10^5$ s$^{-1}$ values given by the monochromatic approximation,} the actual growth rates of non-resonance multi-group {hCFI} are at most $\sim$200 s$^{-1}$ in all our models and they are too slow to affect CCSN outcomes. We adopt a BGK flavor conversion scheme in the simulations to include the effects of resonance-like {hCFI}. We find that the CCSN dynamics and neutrino emission properties are only weakly influenced, and the intrinsic stochasticity due to convection and neutrino-driven turbulence can naturally lead to comparable effects. Hence, our analysis of the non-resonance and resonance-like {hCFI} into CCSN simulations suggests that the effects of neutrino flavor conversion triggered by {hCFI} modes are in general small.
#### Star formation drivers across the M33 disk

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation process across the disk of M33 using a multiwavelength dataset and disk dynamics. We computed numerically equilibrium values of gas densities and scale heights across the disk, taking into account dark matter and testing several analytic approximations that are often used to estimate these variables and the hydrostatic pressure. Orthogonal regressions and hierarchical Bayesian models, as well as random forest (RF) analyses, were used to establish the fundamental relations at physical scales from 160~pc to 1~kpc. The gas pressure, is the main driver of the star formation rate (SFR) surface density throughout the whole star-forming disk of M33. High-pressure regions enhance the atomic-to-molecular gas conversion, with the molecular hydrogen mass surface density being tightly correlated to pressure and a uniform scaling law throughout the M33 disk. The relation between pressure and SFR surface density differs, showing a change in slope from the inner to the outer disk. Scaling laws do not depend on the physical scale and brings out an intrinsic scatter linked to variations in the efficiency and relative age of the molecular gas-to-stars conversion. In the inner disk, where spiral arms are present and the stellar surface density dominates gravity, the pressure and SFR surface densidy establish an almost linear correlation with a smaller dispersion than that of the molecular gas -- SFR surface density relation. In the atomic gas-dominated outer disk, the SFR density has a steeper dependence on pressure, which we propose could be the result of an increasing fraction of diffuse molecular gas that does not form stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The occurrence rate of cold Jupiters was found to depend on stellar mass. The formation environment in the protoplanetary disks regulates core formation and the subsequent gas accretion. In this study, we simulate giant planet formation via pebble accretion accounting for various stellar masses, core formation times, disk turbulent viscosities, and grain opacities. We use a self-consistent formation model that calculates the solid accretion rate and gas accretion rate of growing protoplanets. We investigate how the planetary formation, in particular, the contraction of the envelope, and the formation timescale change under different conditions. We find that to reproduce the observed occurrence rate of cold Jupiters, giant planets must undergo slow envelope contraction after they reach pebble isolation, which lasts for several Myrs. Such a slow contraction phase can be achieved when the grain opacity is assumed to be as high as that of the interstellar medium (ISM). If the grain opacity is smaller than the ISM opacity by a factor of ten or more, the growing protoplanets reach crossover mass within 3 Myrs and form too many cold Jupiters around stars of >0.4Msun. Protoplanets around low-mass stars <0.4Msun take >10 Myrs to reach crossover mass also with low grain opacity. If the grain opacity in the planetary envelope is much lower than that of ISM, other mechanisms, such as atmospheric recycling or planetesimal accretion, is required for cold Jupiter formation. We next explore how the deposition of the accreted heavy elements to the planetary envelope changes the formation timescale. Our model suggests that the formation timescale could be longer due to heavy-element enrichment, resulting from the lower core mass at pebble isolation. We conclude that the details of the formation processes have a significant effect on the planetary growth and therefore, the formation of gaseous planets.

 - **Abstract**
 We have carried out a morphological search for molecular clouds possibly associated with 48 Galactic infrared bubbles with angular radii of $>1'$ in the southern Galactic plane of $295^\circ \le l\le 350^\circ$ and $|b|\le 1^\circ$ presented by Hanaoka et al. (2019). 116 molecular clouds in the $(l,b,V_{\rm LSR})$ space are identified from the archival $^{12}$CO~$J$~=~1--0 line data obtained by the Mopra Southern Galactic plane survey, where $V_{\rm LSR}$ is the CO-line radial velocity. The kinematic distances are derived from $V_{\rm LSR}$ using the most accurate rotation curve of the Milky Way. We also present measurements of velocity dispersion, size parameter, molecular mass, and virial mass of 116 molecular clouds. This catalog is presented to investigate star formation and the origin of molecular shells and cavities, possibly associated with infrared bubbles. CO line intensity maps and position-velocity diagrams of the molecular clouds are available online as supplementary data.

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analyses of the early data from Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1) for the globular cluster 47 Tuc field. The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands (ugriy). We address challenges of crowding near the cluster core and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present for the first time a comprehensive statistical study between type II radio bursts from the metric (m) to the dekameric-hectometric (DH) domain and their associated solar and space weather (SW) phenomena, namely, solar flares (SFs), sunspot (SN) configurations, filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), their interplanetary (IP) counterparts (ICMEs) and shocks, in situ detected particles and geomagnetic storms (GSs). The m-only and m+DH radio signatures are identified from dynamic spectra provided by the ground-based RSTN stations distributed over the globe together with Wind/WAVES satellite data. The DH-only type IIs are adopted from a ready catalog based on Wind/WAVES spacecraft data. We perform the temporal and spatial association between the radio emission and the listed above activity events during solar cycle (SC) 24, separately for the three sub-categories, m-only, m+DH and DH-only type IIs. A quantitative assessment on the occurrence rates is presented as a function of the strength of the specific SW phenomena: highest rates are obtained with CMEs, SFs, filament eruptions, and SN configurations, whereas a much weaker relationship is found with ICMEs, IP shocks, energetic particles, and GSs. The potential of the obtained rates to be used in empirical or physics-based models for SW forecasting is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar radio bursts can provide important insights into the underlying physical mechanisms that drive the small and large-scale eruptions on the Sun. Since metric radio observations can give us direct observational access to the inner and middle corona, they are often used as an important tool to monitor and understand the coronal dynamics. While the sizes of the radio sources that can be observed in the solar corona is essential for understanding the nature of density turbulence within the solar corona and its subsequent influence on the angular broadening observed in radio source measurements, the smallest radio sources associated with solar radio bursts have so far been limited by observational techniques and the radio instrument's baselines. We selected three type II bursts that were observed with the LOFAR core and remote stations in the Solar Cycle 24. We estimated the sizes and shapes (ellipticity) of the radio sources between $20-200$ MHz using a two-dimensional Gaussian approximation. Our analysis shows that the smallest radio source size for type II bursts in the solar corona which can be observed in the solar atmosphere at low frequencies is $1.5^\prime \pm 0.5^\prime$ at 150 MHz. However, even though the observations were taken with remote baselines (with a maximum distance of $\sim 85~km$), the effective baselines were much shorter ($\sim 35~km$) likely due to snapshot imaging of the Sun. Our results show that the radio source sizes are less affected by scattering than suggested in previous studies. Our measurements indicate a smaller source sizes at frequencies below 95 MHz compared to previous reports, though some overlap exists with measurements at higher frequencies, using smaller baselines.
#### The environment of TeV halo progenitors

 - **Abstract**
 TeV halos are extended very-high-energy gamma-ray sources found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding which type of medium pulsars are probing over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions, where they receive a natal kick, until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors, for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess in which medium pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derive the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population, and then apply the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the ISM at around 200 kyr, significantly later than the values most commonly used in the literature. The majority of known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. In order to test this idea, we provide the probability of still residing in the parent environment for a list of known pulsars.
#### Meteoroid stream identification with HDBSCAN unsupervised clustering algorithm

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters. This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score, Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39 meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies 30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further validation is needed to assess physical validity.

 - **Abstract**
 Increasing evidence shows that most stars in the Milky Way, including the Sun, are born in star-forming regions containing also high-mass stars, but due to both observational and theoretical challenges, our comprehension of their chemical evolution is far less clear than that of their low-mass counterparts. We present the project "CHemical Evolution of MassIve star-froming COres" (CHEMICO). The project aims at investigating any aspect of the chemical evolution of high-mass star-forming cores by observing representatives of the three main evolutionary categories: high-mass starless cores, high-mass protostellar objects, and ultra-compact HII regions. We carried out an unbiased spectral line survey of the entire bandwidth at 3, 2, and 1.2 mm with the 30m telescope of the Insitut de Radioastronomie millimetrique towards three targets that represent the three evolutionary stages. The number of lines and species detected increases with evolution. In this first work, we derive the temperature structure of the targets through the analysis of the carbon-bearing species C2H, c-C3H, c-C3H2, C4H, CH3CCH, HC3N, CH3CN, and HC5N. The excitation temperature, Tex, increases with evolution in each species, although not in the same way. Hydrocarbons tend to be associated with the smallest Tex values and enhancements with evolution, while cyanides are associated with the highest Tex values and enhancements. In each target, the higher the number of atoms in the molecule, the higher Tex tends to be. The temperature structure evolves from a cold, uniform envelope traced by simple hydrocarbons in the high-mass starless core stage, to a more stratified envelope in the protostellar stage (made by a hot core, a shell with intermediate Tex, and a larger cold envelope), to finally a hot core surrounded only by a cold envelope in the Ultracompact HII stage.

 - **Abstract**
 The purpose of this paper is to analyze the multi-wavelength and multi-instrument observations of two quiescent filament eruptions as well as the deflection of associated CMEs from the radial direction. The events occurred on 18 October 2017 and 9 May 2021, respectively, in the southern solar hemisphere. Both of them and associated flares were registered by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) Observatory in different EUV wavebands. Using data from STEREO A COR1 and COR2 instruments and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we investigated morphology and kinematics of the eruptions and the latitudinal offset of the related CMEs with respect to the erupting filaments. Our observations provide the evidence that the two filament eruptions were highly non-radial. The observed deviations are attributed to the presence of low-latitude coronal holes.
#### The HR 8799 Debris Disc: Shaped by Planetary Migration and a Possible Fifth Outermost Planet

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The HR 8799 system, hosting four giant planets between a warm and cold debris disc, and an extended dusty tail beyond, serves as an ideal laboratory for studying planetary formation and evolution. The debris discs have been observed across various wavelengths, and the planetary properties are well-constrained. Nonetheless, there are still open questions regarding the role of the planets in shaping the debris discs. Aims. We investigate the system's evolution with the aim of understanding how planetary migration shapes its architecture, both in terms of planets and the disc. Methods. We performed $N$-body simulations to model the HR 8799 system. We examined the orbital evolution of the known four super-Jupiter planets through the course of simple, imposed migration in a gaseous disc as they perturb an external, massless planetesimal disc. We also explore the impact of introducing a fifth planet on the dynamical and morphological aspects of the disc. Results. The planets migrate outward as a result of their imposed interactions with the gaseous disc while maintaining their resonant configuration. This outward migration excites the planetesimal disc, producing a transient scattered population. While a four-planet system partially reproduces the observed cavity between the star and the cold debris disc, the inclusion of a fifth low-mass planet appears to be crucial for better reproducing key morphological aspects of the cold debris disc. Conclusions. This model provides a novel explanation for the architecture of HR 8799. Outward planetary migration, combined with mean motion resonant interactions and a fifth, low-mass planet, can effectively replicate the observed planetary architecture and cold debris disc characteristics. Our findings underscore the potential important role of planetary migration in shaping debris discs.
#### The Effect of Weak Cosmic Ray Heating Events on the Desorption of $\rm H_2$

 - **Abstract**
 The typical amount of molecular hydrogen (${\rm H_2}$) in interstellar ices is not known, but significant freeze-out of ${\rm H_2}$ on dust grains is not expected. However, chemical models ubiquitously predict large amounts of $\rm H_2$ freeze-out in dense cloud conditions, and specialized treatments are needed to control the $\rm H_2$ population on grains. Here we present a numerical desorption model where the effect of weak heating events induced by cosmic rays (CRs) that heat grains to temperatures of a few tens of Kelvin at high frequencies is included, improving upon earlier desorption models that only consider strong heating events (maximum grain temperature close to 100 K) that occur at a low frequency. A temperature of a few tens of Kelvin is high enough to induce efficient desorption of $\rm H_2$, but we find that even the weak heating events do not occur often enough to lead to significant $\rm H_2$ desorption. Taking the weak heating events into account does affect the predicted abundances of other lightly-bound species, but the effect is restricted to low column densities. We make here the canonical assumption that the grains are spherical with a radius of 0.1 $\mu$m. It is conceivable that in the case of a grain size distribution, weak heating events could provide a boost to $\rm H_2$ desorption coming off small grains, which are the most numerous. Further studies are still required to better quantify the role of CRs in the desorption of $\rm H_2$ and other weakly bound species.

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Hydrogen recombination lines (HRLs) are valuable diagnostics of the physical conditions in ionized regions around high-mass stars. Understanding their broadening mechanisms and intensity trends can provide insights into the densities, temperatures, and kinematics of HII regions. We investigate the properties of ionized gas around massive protostars by analyzing hydrogen recombination lines (H-alpha and H-beta) in the Q-band. Observations were conducted using the Yebes 40m radio telescope in the Q-band (30.5~50 GHz) toward six high-mass protostars selected from the SOMA Survey (G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, G28.20-0.05, G35.20-0.74, G19.08-0.29, and G31.28+0.06). The line profiles were analyzed to assess broadening mechanisms, from which electron densities and temperatures were derived. We compared our results with Q-band data from the TianMa 65m Radio Telescope (TMRT) and ALMA Band 1 Science Verification observations of Orion KL. A total of eight H-alpha (n = 51 to 58) and ten H-beta (n = 64 to 73) lines were detected toward G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, and G28.20-0.05, with non-detections in the other sources. Electron densities of \sim \mathrm{1\text{--}5 \times 10^{6}~cm^{-3}} and temperatures of 8000-10000 K were derived. Orion KL shows one order of magnitude lower electron density, but a similar temperature. Notably, G45.12 and G28.20 show increasing intensity with frequency for both H-alpha and H-beta, in contrast to the decreasing trend in Orion KL. The observed line widths indicate contributions from both thermal and dynamical broadening, suggesting high-temperature ionized gas affected by turbulence, outflows, rotation, or stellar winds. Pressure broadening may also play a minor role. The contrasting intensity trends likely reflect differences in local physical conditions or radiative transfer effects, warranting further study through higher-resolution observations and modeling.
