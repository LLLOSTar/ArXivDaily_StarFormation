 - **Abstract**
 Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of sustainable habitability requires characterizing the interior properties, and in particular, the extent and distribution of the tidal heating. The intensity of any inferred geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for understanding the hydrothermal activity and the budget of biologically useful species. We build a statistical framework using an MCMC approach to constrain the interior based on currently available observations of libration, shape, heat budget, and mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can constrain the interior structure, with an emphasis on determining the partitioning of tidal dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational and displacement tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring the amplitude and phase of $k_2$ alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, without a sensitivity to the distribution of heat. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of $h_2$ or $l_2$ facilitates determination of the shell rheology. We provide the precisions required for measuring $k_2$, $h_2$, and/or $l_2$ that enable distinguishing between the two main scenarios of tidal heating, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also investigate the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of a suite of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to instantaneous and sustained habitability at Enceladus.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structural and dynamical properties of Open Clusters (OCs) classified as single, in pairs, or in groups. By analysing their mass, size, age, fractality, and mass segregation, we aim to identify systematic differences among these categories and evaluate the role of the Galactic environment in their evolution. Our sample comprises 420 single OCs, 415 in pairs, and 317 in groups. To characterise their structure, we apply the Q-parameter, which distinguishes fractal from radial distributions. We also compute the local density ratio to quantify mass segregation and explore its dependence on environment. Grouped OCs tend to be the youngest, followed by those in pairs, while single OCs generally exhibit older ages. Although sizes are comparable, OCs in pairs and groups tend to be less concentrated. Structurally, grouped OCs show the highest fractality, which decreases with age as clusters evolve towards more radial configurations. Mass segregation is detected in ~80% of OCs, with a slightly higher incidence in single clusters. Some older single OCs show inverse segregation, with massive stars at larger radii. Spatially, single OCs are more dispersed, whereas paired and grouped ones are concentrated in spiral arms and star-forming regions. OC evolution appears to be shaped by both internal dynamics and environmental influences. Single OCs tend to exhibit signs of more advanced dynamical evolution, whereas those in pairs and groups may retain features reflecting their formation environment. Substructures and high fractality in younger clusters suggest that early interactions play a key role in their long-term development. More massive OCs evolve towards radial configurations, while less massive ones may retain fractal properties for longer. These findings highlight the interplay between intrinsic properties and external conditions in shaping OC evolution.
#### Rethinking Habitability using Biogenic Precursors: Formaldehyde in Millimeter Molecular Clouds of the Inner Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of formaldehyde (H2CO) absorption and radio recombination line (H110a) emission in 215 molecular clouds from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), observed using the Nanshan 25-m radio telescope. H2CO was detected in 88 sources (40.93 percent) with 59 being new detections, while H110a emission was found in only 11 sources (5.12 percent), all coincident with H2CO absorption. There exists a correlation of H2CO fluxes with millimeter fluxes below a 3 Jy threshold and an increased dispersion above it, suggesting the sub-CMB cooling of H2CO. Cross-matching with kinematic distance catalogs revealed H2CO spanning galactocentric distances from 0.216 to 10.769 kpc, with column densities ranging from 7.82 x 10^11 to 6.69 x 10^14 cm-2. A significant inverse correlation was observed between H2CO detection fraction and galactocentric distance, suggesting enhanced star forming activity closer to the Galactic Center. These findings challenge traditional Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) models by demonstrating the presence of biogenic precursors in the inner Galaxy, shielded within dense molecular clouds. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating chemical tracers like H2CO, alongside physical constraints, to refine the boundaries of the GHZ and advance the research of prebiotic chemistry in the Milky Way.
#### The effects of expansion and turbulence on the interplanetary evolution of a magnetic cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) represent the most extreme solar products, showing complex and dynamic structures when detected in situ. They are often preceded by a shock and carry a magnetic cloud organised as a flux rope, surrounded and permeated by turbulent fluctuations, and whose radial size expands during propagation. We investigate the internal dynamics of the 2D section of a cylindrical flux rope propagating at constant velocity in the spherically expanding solar wind, employing the expanding box model, which allows for high spatial resolution. Our setting is simplified, with uniform and non-magnetised solar wind, to which we superpose turbulent fluctuations. We find that the spherically expanding geometry alone perturbs the flux rope equilibrium, producing a radial head-tail velocity profile and a radial size increase. The ratio between the expansion and Alfvén timescales, associated respectively to propagation and internal crossing time, controls the resistance to transverse stretching and the increase of the flux rope radial extent; the plasma beta controls the overall size of the structure. Turbulent fluctuations mainly affect the flux rope transverse structure, spreading its axial field at distances comparable to its size; on the contrary, dynamics along the radial direction remains coherent and the increase in radial size is still consistently observed. We validate our results by comparison with statistical observations and dimensionless estimates, such as the expansion parameter and the radial size scaling exponent, suggesting that the ratio between internal and propagation timescales might help in better classifying different kinds of radial expansions for flux ropes.
#### The Sagittarius stellar stream embedded in a fermionic dark matter halo

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams are essential tracers of the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, with key implications to the problem of dark matter (DM) model distributions, either within or beyond phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM halos. For the first time in the literature, a DM halo model based on first physical principles such as quantum statistical mechanics and thermodynamics is used to try to reproduce the 6D observations of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream. We model both DM haloes, the one of Sgr dwarf and the one of its host with a spherical self-gravitating system of neutral fermions which accounts for the effects of particles escape and fermion degeneracy, the latter causing a high-density core at the center of the halo. Full baryonic components for each galaxy are also considered. We use a spray algorithm with $\sim 10^{5}$ particles to generate the Sgr tidal debris, which evolves in the gravitational potential of the host-progenitor system, to compare with the full phase-space data of the stream. We repeat this kind of simulations for different parameter setups of the fermionic model including the particle mass, with special attention to test different DM halo morphologies allowed by the physics. We find that across the different families of fermionic halo models, they can only reproduce the trailing arm of the Sgr stream. Within the observationally allowed span of enclosed masses where the stream moves, neither the power-law like, nor the polytropic behaviour of the fermionic halo models can answer for the observed trend of the leading tail. A conclusion which is shared by former analysis using other type of spherically symmetric haloes. We conclude that further model sophistications such as abandoning spherical symmetry and including the Large Magellanic Cloud perturber are needed for a proper modelisation of the overall Milky Way potential within this kind of first principle halo models.
#### Eclipsing white dwarf from the Zwicky Transient Facility: II. Seven eclipsing double white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 In a systematic search for eclipsing white dwarfs using Zwicky transient facility (ZTF) data, we found seven eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital periods ranging from 45 minutes to 3 hours. We collected high-speed light curves, archival multi-wavelength data, and optical spectra for all systems and determined the binary parameters for each of them. We show that six of the systems are low-mass, double helium-core white dwarf binaries, with the last one a carbon-oxygen -- helium core white dwarf binary. These binaries slowly spiral inwards due to gravitational wave energy losses and are expected to merge within 36Myr--1.2Gyr, and we predict that the shortest orbital period binary will show a measurable eclipse arrival time delay within a decade. The two longest systems show a delay in the arrival time of the secondary eclipse, which we attribute to a small eccentricity of $\approx 2\times10^{-3}$. This is the first time that a non-zero eccentricity is measured in a compact double white dwarf binary. We suggest that these systems emerged from the common envelope with this small eccentricity, and because of the relatively long orbital period, gravitational wave emission has not yet circularised the binaries. Finally, we predict that relativistic apsidal precession will result in a change in the delay of the secondary eclipse that is measurable within a decade.
#### Discovery of a dwarf planet candidate in an extremely wide orbit: 2017 OF201
 - **Authors:** Sihao Cheng, Jiaxuan Li, Eritas Yang

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a dwarf planet candidate, 2017 OF201, currently located at a distance of 90.5 au. Its orbit is extremely wide and extends to the inner Oort cloud, with a semi-major axis of 838 au and a perihelion of 44.9 au precisely determined from 19 observations over seven years. Assuming a typical albedo of 0.15, we estimate a diameter about 700 km, making it the second-largest known object in this dynamical population and a likely dwarf planet. Its high eccentricity suggests that it is part of a broader, unseen population of similar objects totaling about 1 % of Earth's mass. Notably, the orbit of 2017 OF201 lies well outside the clustering of longitude of perihelion observed in extreme trans-Neptunian objects, which has been proposed as dynamical evidence for a distant, undetected planet.
