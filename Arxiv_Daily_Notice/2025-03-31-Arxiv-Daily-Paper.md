#### A rapid channel for the collisional formation and gravitational wave driven mergers of supermassive black hole seeds at high redshift

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by JWST observations of dense, clumpy and clustered high redshift star formation, we simulate the hierarchical assembly of nine $M_{\mathrm{cl}}=10^6 M_\odot$ star clusters using the BIFROST N-body code. Our low metallicity models ($0.01Z_\odot$) with post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes include evolving populations of single, binary and triple stars. Massive stars grow by stellar collisions and collapse into intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) up to $M_\mathrm{\bullet}\sim6200 M_\odot$, stellar multiplicity boosting the IMBH masses by a factor of $2$--$3$. The IMBHs tidally disrupt (TDE) $\sim50$ stars in $10$ Myr with peak TDE rates of $\Gamma\sim10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ per cluster. These IMBHs are natural seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the hierarchical assembly frequently leads to $>2$ SMBH seeds per cluster and their rapid mergers ($t<10$ Myr). We propose that a gravitational wave (GW) driven merger of IMBHs with $1000 M_\odot \lesssim M_\bullet \lesssim 10000 M_\odot$ with comparable masses is a characteristic GW fingerprint of SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z>10$, and IMBH formation in similar environments at lower redshifts. Massive star clusters provide a unique environment for the early Universe GW studies for the next-generation GW observatories including the Einstein Telescope and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

 - **Abstract**
 Torques from asymmetric dust structures (so-called dust-void and filamentary structures) formed around low-mass planets embedded in a non turbulent dust-gas disk can exceed the torques produced by the gas disk component, then governing the planet's orbital dynamics. Here, we investigate how these structures (hence the dust torque) change when the effect of turbulent dust diffusion and dust feedback are included, and the direct implications on the migration of Earth-like planets. Using the \textsc{Fargo3D} code, we perform 2D and 3D multifluid hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on a non-migrating planet with the mass $M_p=1.5\,M_\oplus$ in 2D and on migrating planets with $M_p\in[1.5,12]\,M_\oplus$ in 3D. We vary the $\delta$-dimensionless diffusivity parameter in the range $[0,3\times10^{-3}]$ and consider three different Stokes numbers $\mathrm{St}=\{0.04,0.26,0.55\}$, which are representative of the gas, transitional and gravity-dominated regimes, respectively. In our 2D models, we find that turbulent diffusion of dust prevents the formation of the dust-void and filamentary structures when $\delta>3\times10^{-4}$. Otherwise, dust structures survive turbulent diffusion flow. However, dust and total torques become positive only in transitional and gravity-dominated regimes. In our 3D models, we find that the dust-void is drastically modified and the high-density ring-shaped barrier delineating the dust-void disappears if $\delta\gtrsim10^{-4} $, due to the effect of dust turbulent diffusion along with the back-reaction of the dust. For all values of $\delta$, the filament in front of the planet is replaced by a low-density trench. Remarkably, as we allow the planets to migrate, the evolving dust-void can drive either runaway migration or outward (inward) oscillatory-torque migration. Our study thus suggests that low-mass Earth-like planets can undergo runaway migration in dusty disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a>10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.

 - **Abstract**
 Some stars orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBH) are expected to undergo a gravitational-wave (GW)-driven inspiral and initiate mass transfer on nearly circular orbits. However, the stability and duration of such phases remain unexplored. In this work, we focus on the evolution of a low-mass, radiative-envelope subgiant star being stripped by an SMBH. We find that such systems can undergo a long-lasting, stable mass-transfer phase, even if none of the angular momentum of the transferred material returns to the orbit to counterbalance the GW-driven decay. We show an example where a 2 Msun subgiant is stripped before entering the LISA band and loses almost its entire hydrogen envelope. The remaining helium core undergoes a prolonged GW-driven inspiral, becoming a loud LISA source. If formed in our galaxy, the system would be detectable for several hundred thousand years, ultimately reaching extreme signal-to-noise ratios of a million. Hydrogen shell flashes in the residual envelope cause temporary radial expansions of the stripped star. As a result, a few additional phases of rapid mass transfer occur at orbital periods of 20 - 30 hours. Eventually, the core possibly undergoes circular partial tidal disruption at an orbital period of ~10 minutes, corresponding to a GW emission frequency of a few mHz. We estimate a chance of about 1% that such a detectable LISA source exists in our own galactic center. The loud final GW transient may lead to a few detections reaching as far as ~1 Gpc, including, e.g., the Abell clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark and dynamic parts of the Galaxy, including the bulk shape and movement of the Galactic Bulge and characteristics of dark compact object populations, such as a hypothetical population of primordial black holes (PBHs), are difficult to study directly by their very nature, but are critical to our understanding of the universe. Fortunately, all of these mysteries can be uniquely studied via gravitational microlensing, a method of astronomical detection that traces mass and dynamics as opposed to light. Using the OGLE-IV microlensing survey bulge fields, we apply a Bayesian hierarchical model to jointly infer properties of the Galaxy, the characteristics of compact objects, and and test PBHs with an extended mass distribution as a test PBHs as a viable explanation of dark matter, extending work focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, both with much lower event-rates. We infer a preference within the data for a lower patternspeed in the galactic model and a wider mass spectrum for compact objects. When adding a PBH component to the favored astrophysical model from our initial investigations, we find a Bayes factor of $\ln\mathcal{B} = 20.23$ preferring the PBH model. Upon further investigation of these results, we find the critical feature in the PBH model to be the velocity distribution, which is fundamentally different than the velocity distribution of astrophysical objects and uniquely able to explain a large number of low parallax, low timescale microlensing events. Noting that this effect is not unique to PBHs, we consider the implications of these results as applied to a hypothetical population of PBHs and discuss alternative explanations, including a variety of other possible astrophysical and survey or analysis systematics.
#### Asteroseismology of Long-Period Variables with OGLE-IV data: Using Global Seismic Parameters as Luminosity Indicators

 - **Abstract**
 Long-period variables (LPVs) are high-luminosity red giants or supergiants with pulsation periods ranging from days to years. Many LPVs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Galactic Bulge (BLG) have been continuously observed over a time span of 26 years by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. Using OGLE-IV data, we applied Gaussian Processes with kernels tailored for solar-like oscillations to extract two global asteroseismic parameters: the frequency of maximum power (numax) and the large frequency separation (Dnu), for LPVs with primary mode periods (P1) between 10 and 100 days in the LMC and BLG. We found that the numax-Dnu relation for LPVs in this work aligns with that of lower-luminosity Kepler red giants, confirming that the pulsations of these LPVs are likely solar-like. We found that numax and Dnu can serve as luminosity indicators. Compared to P1, numax and Dnu exhibit significantly tighter correlations with the absolute magnitude in the 2MASS K_s band (M_{K}), with corresponding scatter of 0.27 mag and 0.21 mag, respectively. Using the calibrated numax-mk and Dnu-mk relations for LPVs in the LMC, we determined the M_{K} values for individual stars in the BLG. By accounting for extinction, we further calculated the distances to 4,948 BLG stars. The peak of the resulting distance distribution corresponds to an estimated distance to the Galactic center of approximately 9.1 kpc, which appears to be overestimated, suggesting that the seismic luminosity relation calibrated from the LMC may not be directly applicable to BLG stars.

 - **Abstract**
 $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Galactic outflows shape galaxy evolution, but their mass, energy, and momentum transfer remain uncertain. High-resolution spectroscopy can help, but systematic discrepancies hinder model interpretation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of semi-analytical line transfer (SALT) and empirical partial covering models (PCMs) to recover the properties of outflows in the FIRE-2 simulation suite from synthetic Si II lines (1190 $Å$, 1193 $Å$, 1260 $Å$, 1304 $Å$, 1527 $Å$). When applicable, we assess each model's ability to recover mass, energy, and momentum outflow rates, as well as radial density and velocity profiles, column densities, and flow geometries. We find that the PCM underestimates column densities by 1.3 dex on average in the range $15 < \log N\ [\text{cm}^{-2}] < 17$ with dispersion 1.3 dex. We attribute this bias to instrumental smoothing. Since the PCM underestimates column densities, it also underestimates flow rates, though its predictions are independent of radius, with a dispersion of 0.55 dex. We detect no bias in the SALT estimates of the column density with dispersion 1.3 dex. When the velocity and density field obey power laws, SALT can constrain the mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates to 0.36 (0.63), 0.56 (0.56), and 0.97 (0.80) dex at $0.15(0.30)R_{\text{vir}}$, respectively. However, certain profiles in FIRE-2 fall outside the SALT framework, where the model breaks down. We find that SALT effectively tracks the flow geometry, capturing the temporal evolution of the photon escape fraction that is out of phase with the star formation rate, fully consistent with hydrodynamic simulations. We advocate for integral field unit spectroscopy to better constrain flow properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The sub-Neptune GJ 1214b has an infamously flat transmission spectrum, likely due to thick aerosols in its atmosphere. A recent JWST MIRI spectroscopic phase curve of GJ 1214 b added to this picture, suggesting a highly reflective and metal-rich atmosphere. Using a 3D General Circulation Model with both photochemical hazes and condensate clouds, we characterize how different aerosol types affect the atmospheric structure of GJ 1214 b and manifest in its spectroscopic phase curve. Additionally, we reanalyze the original GJ 1214 b JWST phase curve. The reanalysis shows a hotter nightside, similar dayside temperature, and a lower, but still elevated, Bond albedo (0.42 +/- 0.11) than the original results. We find that a scenario with both clouds and hazes is most consistent with the JWST phase curve. Reflective clouds or hazes are needed to explain the large Bond albedo, and hazes or a super-solar metallicity help account for the several hundred Kelvin day-night temperature difference measured by the phase curve.

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the mineral composition of volcanic samples similar to lunar materials, focusing on olivine and pyroxene. Using hyperspectral imaging from 400 to 1000 nm, we created data cubes to analyze the reflectance characteristics of samples from samples from Vulcano, a volcanically active island in the Aeolian Archipelago, north of Sicily, Italy, categorizing them into nine regions of interest and analyzing spectral data for each. We applied various unsupervised clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, GMM, and Spectral Clustering, to classify the spectral profiles. Principal Component Analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures associated with specific minerals, facilitating precise identification. Clustering performance varied by region, with K-Means achieving the highest silhouette-score of 0.47, whereas GMM performed poorly with a score of only 0.25. Non-negative Matrix Factorization aided in identifying similarities among clusters across different methods and reference spectra for olivine and pyroxene. Hierarchical clustering emerged as the most reliable technique, achieving a 94\% similarity with the olivine spectrum in one sample, whereas GMM exhibited notable variability. Overall, the analysis indicated that both Hierarchical and K-Means methods yielded lower errors in total measurements, with K-Means demonstrating superior performance in estimated dispersion and clustering. Additionally, GMM showed a higher root mean square error compared to the other models. The RMSE analysis confirmed K-Means as the most consistent algorithm across all samples, suggesting a predominance of olivine in the Vulcano region relative to pyroxene. This predominance is likely linked to historical formation conditions similar to volcanic processes on the Moon, where olivine-rich compositions are common in ancient lava flows and impact melt rocks.
