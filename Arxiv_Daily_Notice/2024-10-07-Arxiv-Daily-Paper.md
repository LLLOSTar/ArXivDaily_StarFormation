#### Off-center ignition of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs does not resolve the tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation of type Ia supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but the exact nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent studies have suggested that a propagating detonation within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core can subsequently trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The resulting explosion resembles a central ignition of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD (SCD), which is known to be in tension with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, where $t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from the ejecta) is positively correlated with $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ (the synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass). SCD predicts an anti-correlation between $t_0$ and $M_{\rm{Ni}56}$, with $t_0\mathord{\approx}30\,\textrm{day}$ for luminous ($M_{\rm{Ni}56}\gtrsim0.5\,M_{\odot}$) SNe Ia, while the observed $t_0$ is in the range of 35-45 days. In this study, we apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate in 2D the impact of off-center ignition in sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO WD, aiming to better emulate the behavior expected in the DDM scenario. Our calculations of the $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation, which do not require radiation transfer calculations, achieve convergence to within a few percent with a numerical resolution of $\mathord{\sim}1\,\rm{km}$. We find that the results only slightly depend on the ignition location, mirroring the SCD model, and consequently, the discrepancy with the observed $t_0$-$M_{\rm{Ni}56}$ relation remains unresolved.
#### Magnetically-Driven Neutron-Rich Ejecta Unleashed: Global 3D Neutrino-GRMHD Simulations of Collapsars Reveal the Conditions for r-process Nucleosynthesis

 - **Abstract**
 Collapsars - rapidly rotating stellar cores that form black holes (BHs) - can power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and are proposed to be key contributors to the production of heavy elements in the Universe via the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). Previous neutrino-transport collapsar simulations have been unable to unbind neutron-rich material from the disk. However, these simulations have not included magnetic fields or the BH, both of which are essential for launching mass outflows. We present $\nu$H-AMR, a novel neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ($\nu$GRMHD) code, which we use to perform the first 3D $\nu$GRMHD collapsar simulations. We find a self-consistent formation of a disk with initially weak magnetic flux, resulting in a low accretion speed and leaving sufficient time for the disk to neutronize. However, once substantial magnetic flux accumulates near the BH, it becomes dynamically important, leading to a magnetically arrested disk that unbinds some of the neutron-rich material. The strong flux also accelerates the accretion speed, preventing further disk neutronization. The neutron-rich disk ejecta collides with the infalling stellar gas, generating a shocked cocoon with an electron fraction, $Y_\text{e}\gtrsim0.2$. Continuous mixing between the cocoon and neutron-poor stellar gas incrementally raises the outflow $Y_\text{e}$, but the final $r$-process yield is determined earlier at the point of neutron capture freeze-out. Our models require extreme magnetic fluxes and mass accretion rates to eject neutron-rich material ($Y_\text{e}\lesssim0.3$), implying very high $r$-process ejecta masses $M_\text{ej}\lesssim{}M_\odot$. Future work will explore under what conditions more typical collapsar engines become $r$-process factories.

 - **Abstract**
 Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.
#### Mixed-mode coupling in the Red Clump I. Standard single star models

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of global, resonant oscillation modes in red giant stars offers valuable insights into their internal structures. In this study, we investigate in detail the information we can recover on the structural properties of core-helium burning (CHeB) stars by examining how the coupling between gravity- and pressure-mode cavities depends on several stellar properties, including mass, chemical composition, and evolutionary state. Using the structure of models computed with the stellar evolution code MESA we calculate the coupling coefficient implementing analytical expressions, which are appropriate for the strong coupling regime and the structure of the evanescent region in CHeB stars. Our analysis reveals a notable anti-correlation between the coupling coefficient and both the mass and metallicity of stars in the regime $M \lesssim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, in agreement with Kepler data. We attribute this correlation primarily to variations in the density contrast between the stellar envelope and core. The strongest coupling is expected thus for red-horizontal branch stars, partially stripped stars, and stars in the higher-mass range exhibiting solar-like oscillations ($M \gtrsim 1.8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$). While our investigation emphasises some limitations of current analytical expressions, it also presents promising avenues. The frequency dependence of the coupling coefficient emerges as a potential tool for reconstructing the detailed stratification of the evanescent region.

 - **Abstract**
 To date, JWST has detected the earliest known star clusters in our Universe (Adamo et al. 2024, Messa et al. 2024, Vanzella et al. 2024, Mowla et al. 2024). They appear to be relatively compact (~few pc, Adamo et al. 2024) and had only recently formed their stars. It was speculated that these clusters may be the earliest progenitors of globular clusters ever detected. Globular clusters are a relic of the initial stages of star formation in the Universe. However, because they contain little to no dark matter (e.g., Heggie & Hut 1996, Bradford et al. 2011, Conroy et al. 2011, Ibata et al. 2013), their formation mechanism poses a significant theoretical challenge. A recent suggestion pointed out that the relative velocity between the gas and the dark matter (Tseliakhovich & Hirata 2010) in the early Universe could naturally form potentially star-forming regions outside of dark matter halos. Here, for the first time, we follow the star formation process of these early Universe objects using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, including mechanical feedback. Our results suggest that the first dark matter-less star clusters are top-heavy, with a higher abundance of massive stars compared to today's clusters and extremely high stellar mass surface densities compared to the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Most of the super-massive black holes in the Universe accrete material in an obscured phase. While it is commonly accepted that the "dusty torus" is responsible for the nuclear obscuration, its geometrical, physical, and chemical properties are far from being properly understood. In this paper, we take advantage of the multiple X-ray observations taken between 2007 and 2020, as well as of optical to far infra-red (FIR) observations of NGC 6300, a nearby ($z=0.0037$) Seyfert 2 galaxy. The goal of this project is to study the nuclear emission and the properties of the obscuring medium, through a multi-wavelength study conducted from X-ray to IR. We perform a simultaneous X-ray spectral fitting and optical-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to investigate the obscuring torus. For the X-ray spectral fitting, physically motivated torus models, such as borus02, UXClumpy and XClumpy are used. The SED fitting is done using XCIGALE. Through joint analysis, we constrain the physical parameters of the torus and the emission properties of the accreting supermassive black hole. Through X-ray observations taken in the last 13 years, we have not found any significant line-of-sight column density variability for this source, but observed the X-ray flux dropping $\sim40-50\%$ in 2020 with respect to previous observations. The UXClumpy model predicts the presence of an inner ring of Compton-thick gaseous medium, responsible for the reflection dominated spectra above 10 keV. Through multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure an Eddington accretion rate $\lambda_{\rm{Edd}}\sim2\times10^{-3}$, which falls in the range of the radiatively inefficient accretion solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 With orbital periods longer than 200 years, most long-period comets (LPCs) remain undiscovered until they are in-bound towards perihelion. The comets that pass close to Earth's orbit are Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs). Those with orbital periods up to ~4000 years tend to have passed close to Earth's orbit in a previous orbit and produced a meteoroid stream dense enough to be detected at Earth as a meteor shower. In anticipation of Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we investigate how these meteor showers can guide dedicated searches for their parent comets. Assuming search parameters informed by LSST, we calculated where the 17 known parent bodies of long-period comet meteor showers would have been discovered based on a cloud of synthetic comets generated from the shower properties as measured at Earth. We find that the synthetic comets predict the on-sky location of the parent comets at the time of their discovery. The parent comet's location on average would have been 1.51 $\pm$1.19$°$ from a line fit through the synthetic comet cloud. The difference between the heliocentric distance of the parent and mean heliocentric distance of synthetic comets on the line was 2.09 $\pm$1.89 au for comets with unknown absolute nuclear magnitudes and 0.96 $\pm$0.80 au for comets with known absolute nuclear magnitudes. We applied this method to the $\sigma$-Hydrids, the proposed meteor shower of Comet Nishimura, and found that it successfully matched the pre-covery location of this comet 8 months prior to Nishimura's discovery.

 - **Abstract**
 Interacting binary star systems play a critical role in many areas of astrophysics. One interesting example of a binary merger product are Thorne-Żytkow Objects (TŻOs), stars that look like red supergiants but contain neutron stars at their cores. TŻOs were theorized nearly five decades ago, and significant work has gone into understanding the physics of their formation, evolution, and stability. Several searches for TŻO candidates have also been carried out. Whether or not TŻOs could even exist or if they would be stable after formation has also been investigated. Understanding the existence and possible prevalence of TŻOs would have important effects on our understanding of binary evolution, stellar mergers, and inform binary population synthesis models. In this chapter, we review the formation channels, evolution and structure, final fates, and observable signatures of TŻOs, as well as candidates in the literature, from the inception of TŻO theory to recent progress in the field.

 - **Abstract**
 The disk instability model is a promising pathway for giant planet formation in various conditions. At the moment, population synthesis models are used to investigate the outcomes of this theory, where a key ingredient of the disk population evolution are collisions of self-gravitating clumps formed by the disk instabilities. In this study, we explore the wide range of dynamics between the colliding clumps by performing state-of-the-art Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations with a hydrogen-helium mixture equation of state and investigate the parameter space of collisions between clumps of different ages, masses (1--10 Jupiter mass), various impact conditions (head-on to oblique collisions) and a range of relative velocities. We find that the perfect merger assumption used in population synthesis models is rarely satisfied and that the outcomes of most of the collisions lead to erosion, disruption or a hit-and-run. We also show that in some cases collisions can initiate the dynamical collapse of the clump. We conclude that population synthesis models should abandon the simplifying assumption of perfect merging. Relaxing this assumption will significantly affect the inferred population of planets resulting from the disk instability model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) is a small imaging instrument onboard Mars Express with a field of view of ~40x30 degrees. The camera was initially intended to provide visual confirmation of the separation of the Beagle 2 lander and has similar technical specifications to a typical webcam of the 2000s. In 2007, a few years after the end of its original mission, VMC was turned on again to obtain full-disk images of Mars to be used for outreach purposes. As VMC obtained more images, the scientific potential of the camera became evident, and in 2018 the camera was given an upgraded status of a new scientific instrument, with science goals in the field of Martian atmosphere meteorology. The wide Field of View of the camera combined with the orbit of Mars Express enable the acquisition of full-disk images of the planet showing different local times, which for a long time has been rare among orbital missions around Mars. The small data volume of images also allows videos that show the atmospheric dynamics of dust and cloud systems to be obtained. This paper is intended to be the new reference paper for VMC as a scientific instrument, and thus provides an overview of the updated procedures to plan, command and execute science observations of the Martian atmosphere. These observations produce valuable science data that is calibrated and distributed to the community for scientific use.
#### An Extremely Elongated Cloud over Arsia Mons Volcano on Mars: II. Mesoscale modeling

 - **Abstract**
 In a previous work (Hernández-Bernal et al. 2021) we performed an observational analysis of the Arsia Mons Elongated Cloud (AMEC), which stands out due to its impressive size and shape, quick dynamics, and the fact that it happens during the martian dusty season. Observations show that its morphology can be split in a head, on the western slope of the volcano of around 120 km in diameter; and a tail, that expands to the west reaching more than 1000 km in length, making the AMEC the longest orographic cloud observed so far in the solar system. In this work we run the LMD (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique) Mesoscale Model to gain insight into the physics of the AMEC. We note that it is coincident in terms of local time and seasonality with the fastest winds on the summit of Arsia Mons. A downslope windstorm on the western slope is followed by a hydraulic-like jump triggering a strong vertical updraft that propagates upwards in the atmosphere, causing a drop in temperatures of down to 30K at 40-50 km in altitude, spatially and temporarily coincident with the observed head of the AMEC. However the model does not reproduce the microphysics of this cloud: the optical depth is too low and the expansion of the tail does not happen in the model. The observed diurnal cycle is correctly captured by the model for the head of the cloud. This work raises new questions that will guide future observations of the AMEC.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in radio astronomy is a complex task due to the challenges posed by radio frequency interference (RFI) and signal dispersion in the interstellar medium. Traditional search algorithms are often inefficient, time-consuming, and generate a high number of false positives. In this paper, we present DRAFTS, a deep learning-based radio fast transient search pipeline. DRAFTS integrates object detection and binary classification techniques to accurately identify FRBs in radio data. We developed a large, real-world dataset of FRBs for training deep learning models. The search test on FAST real observation data demonstrates that DRAFTS performs exceptionally in terms of accuracy, completeness, and search speed. In the re-search of FRB 20190520B observation data, DRAFTS detected more than three times the number of bursts compared to Heimdall, highlighting the potential for future FRB detection and analysis.
#### JWST/NIRISS reveals the water-rich "steam world" atmosphere of GJ 9827 d

 - **Abstract**
 With sizable volatile envelopes but smaller radii than the solar system ice giants, sub-Neptunes have been revealed as one of the most common types of planet in the galaxy. While the spectroscopic characterization of larger sub-Neptunes (2.5-4R$_\oplus$) has revealed hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, smaller sub-Neptunes (1.6--2.5R$_\oplus$) could either host thin, rapidly evaporating hydrogen-rich atmospheres or be stable metal-rich "water worlds" with high mean molecular weight atmospheres and a fundamentally different formation and evolutionary history. Here, we present the 0.6--2.8$\mu$m JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of GJ 9827 d, the smallest (1.98 R$_\oplus$) warm (T$_\mathrm{eq, A_B=0.3} \sim 620$K) sub-Neptune where atmospheric absorbers have been detected to date. Our two transit observations with NIRISS/SOSS, combined with the existing HST/WFC3 spectrum, enable us to break the clouds-metallicity degeneracy. We detect water in a highly metal-enriched "steam world" atmosphere (O/H of $\sim 4$ by mass and H$_2$O found to be the background gas with a volume mixing ratio of >31%). We further show that these results are robust to stellar contamination through the transit light source effect. We do not detect escaping metastable He, which, combined with previous nondetections of escaping He and H, supports the steam atmosphere scenario. In water-rich atmospheres, hydrogen loss driven by water photolysis happens predominantly in the ionized form which eludes observational constraints. We also detect several flares in the NIRISS/SOSS light-curves with far-UV energies of the order of 10$^{30}$ erg, highlighting the active nature of the star. Further atmospheric characterization of GJ 9827 d probing carbon or sulfur species could reveal the origin of its high metal enrichment.
#### Connecting Lyman-$\alpha$ and ionizing photon escape in the Sunburst Arc

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) and Lyman continuum (LyC) properties of the Sunburst Arc, a $z=2.37$ gravitationally lensed galaxy with a multiply-imaged, compact region leaking LyC and a triple-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile indicating direct Ly$\alpha$ escape. Non-LyC-leaking regions show a redshifted Ly$\alpha$ peak, a redshifted and central Ly$\alpha$ peak, or a triple-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile. We measure the properties of the Ly$\alpha$ profile from different regions of the galaxy using $R\sim5000$ Magellan/MagE spectra. We compare the Ly$\alpha$ spectral properties to LyC and narrowband Ly$\alpha$ maps from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging to explore the subgalactic Ly$\alpha-$LyC connection. We find strong correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient $r>0.6$) between the LyC escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$) and Ly$\alpha$ (1) peak separation $v_{\rm{sep}}$, (2) ratio of the minimum flux density between the redshifted and blueshifted Ly$\alpha$ peaks to continuum flux density $f_{\rm{min}}/f_{\rm{cont}}$, and (3) equivalent width. We favor a complex \ion{H}{1} geometry to explain the Ly$\alpha$ profiles from non-LyC-leaking regions and suggest two \ion{H}{1} geometries that could diffuse and/or rescatter the central Ly$\alpha$ peak from the LyC-leaking region into our sightline across transverse distances of several hundred parsecs. Our results emphasize the complexity of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the anisotropies of \ion{H}{1} gas on subgalactic scales. Large differences in the physical scales on which we observe spatially variable direct escape Ly$\alpha$, blueshifted Ly$\alpha$, and escaping LyC photons in the Sunburst Arc underscore the importance of resolving the physical scales that govern Ly$\alpha$ and LyC escape.
