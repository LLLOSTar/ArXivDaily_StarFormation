 - **Abstract**
 Young supernova remnants (SNRs) provide crucial insights into explosive nucleosynthesis products and their velocity distribution soon after the explosion. However, these velocities are influenced by the dynamics of the circumstellar medium (CSM), which originates from the progenitor's late-phase mass loss. Cas A, the youngest known Galactic core-collapse SNR, was studied to analyze the spatial distribution of Si and S radial velocities using two high-spectral resolution observations from the XRISM-Resolve imaging this http URL's capabilities enabled the detailed characterization of Si XIII, Si XIV, S XV, and S XVI lines, whose line shapes can be resolved and modeled using Gaussian radial-velocity components. The radial velocities measured generally align with previous CCD-based results, confirming that they were not artifacts caused by blended lines or ionization variations. Modeling line profiles with two-component Gaussians improved fits in some regions, revealing distinct redshifted (backside) and blueshifted (frontside) components only in a few specific areas. In most regions, however, both components were either both redshifted (northwest) or both blueshifted (southeast), consistent with the patchy ejecta shell morphology seen in optically emitting fast-moving knots. The individual line components revealed a line broadening ranging from $\sigma_v \approx 200$ to $\sigma_v \approx 2000$ km/s. Components with $1000 \lesssim \sigma_v \lesssim 2000$km/s are consistent with previously determined reverse shock velocities, suggesting non-equilibrated or partially equilibrated ion temperatures. Narrow components with small radial velocities found near Cas A's projected center likely originate from shocked CSM plasma. But the low radial velocity and small $\sigma_v$ defies identifying these components with either the frontside or backside of the SNR, or both.

 - **Abstract**
 We present analysis of the plateau and late-time phase properties of a sample of 39 Type II supernovae (SNe II) that show narrow, transient, high-ionization emission lines (i.e., "IIn-like") in their early-time spectra from interaction with confined, dense circumstellar material (CSM). Originally presented by Jacobson-Galán et al 2024a, this sample also includes multicolor light curves and spectra extending to late-time phases of 35 SNe with no evidence for IIn-like features at <2 days after first light. We measure photospheric phase light-curve properties for the distance-corrected sample and find that SNe II with IIn-like features have significantly higher luminosities and decline rates at +50 days than the comparison sample, which could be connected to inflated progenitor radii, lower ejecta mass, and/or persistent CSM interaction. However, we find no statistical evidence that the measured plateau durations and $^{56}$Ni masses of SNe II with and without IIn-like features arise from different distributions. We estimate progenitor zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses for all SNe with nebular spectroscopy through spectral model comparisons and find that most objects, both with and without IIn-like features, are consistent with progenitor masses <12.5 M$_{\odot}$. Combining progenitor ZAMS masses with CSM densities inferred from early-time spectra suggests multiple channels for enhanced mass loss in the final years before core collapse such as a convection-driven chromosphere or binary interaction. Finally, we find spectroscopic evidence for ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction at radii $>10^{16}$ cm, consistent with substantial progenitor mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w < 50$ km/s) in the final centuries to millennia before explosion.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]
#### First Detection of Molecular Activity in the Largest Known Oort Cloud Comet: ALMA Imaging of C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) at 16.6 au from the Sun

 - **Abstract**
 We report observations of comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) carried out on UT 2024 March 8 and 17 at a heliocentric distance ($r_{\mathrm{H}}$) of 16.6 au using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The CO ($J$=2-1) line at 230 GHz was detected along with continuum emission from its dust coma and large ($\sim$140 km) nucleus, revealing the nature of the activity drivers and outgassing kinematics of the largest Oort cloud comet discovered to date. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra, production rates, and parent scale lengths for CO and a stringent upper limit for the H$_2$CO production rate. CO outgassing displays multiple active jets which evolve from one epoch to the next. The continuum emission is compact and spatially unresolved, and is consistent with thermal emission from the large nucleus and a tentative detection of a dust coma. Complementary optical observations provided activity context for the ALMA epochs, indicating that UN271 underwent an outburst in late February before returning to a quiescent brightness in mid--late March. These results represent the first secure detection of molecular activity reported in the literature for C/2014 UN271 and highlight the dynamic nature of this distantly active small world.

 - **Abstract**
 Double Neutron Stars (DNSs) are unique probes to study various aspects of modern astrophysics. Recent discoveries have confirmed direct connections between DNSs and supernova explosions. This provides valuable information about the evolutionary history of these systems, especially regarding whether the second-born Neutron Star (NS) originated from either a Core-Collapse ($CC$) or Electron-Capture Supernovae ($ECSNe$) event. The provided scale diagram illustrates the distribution of different types of DNSs on the basis of their orbital parameters and other factors, including mass loss. As a result, the physical processes in DNSs vary depending on the formation mechanisms of the second-born NS and characteristics of the systems. $ECSNe$ processes are typically associated with merging systems ($e\times{P_{orb}}< 0.05$), while $CC$ processes are more commonly linked to non-merging systems ($e\times{P_{orb}}> 0.05$). Our results suggest a critical mass threshold of 1.30$M_\odot \pm 0.22M_\odot$ (critical value) for the $ECSNe$ process to form an NS, while $CC$ processes might occur at higher masses. Examining the orbital parameters of DNSs in a known gravitational potential can enhance our understanding of the theoretical predictions for DNS progenitor characteristics. It turns out that the $ECSNe$ process predominantly produces DNS systems with short orbital ($P_{orb} \leq 0.25 d$), nearly circular orbits ($e\simeq 0.2$), accompanied by minimal kick velocities imparted on the proto-NS and significant mass loss. In contrast, their orbital dynamics in a known gravitational potential plays a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the SNe geometry and the formation and evolution processes among different NS samples.

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC onboard the SRG observatory we have detected, for the first time, X-ray pulsations with a period of ~106 s from the poorly-studied high-mass X-ray binary RX J0535.0-6700 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), thus proving that the accretor is a neutron star with strong magnetic field. Pulsations with similar period were also found in archival archival data from Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Using photometry from WISE we shown that the source demonstrate significant variability in IR during the last twenty years, which could be caused by a secular evolution of the decretion disk. This discovery makes RX J0535.0-6700 another member of the large family of X-ray pulsars with Be-type companions in the LMC.

 - **Abstract**
 The ionized interstellar medium disperses pulsar radio signals, resulting in a stochastic time-variable delay known as the dispersion measure (DM) noise. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, we measure a DM together with a time of arrival from a pulsar observation to handle frequency-dependent profile evolution, interstellar scintillation, and radio frequency interference more robustly, and to reduce data volumes. In this paper, we derive a method to incorporate arbitrary models of DM variation, including Gaussian process models, in pulsar timing and noise analysis and pulsar timing array analysis. This generalizes the existing method for handling DM noise in wideband datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-long period transients (ULPs) are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for isolated ULPs, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$~hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as Galactic ULPs may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.
