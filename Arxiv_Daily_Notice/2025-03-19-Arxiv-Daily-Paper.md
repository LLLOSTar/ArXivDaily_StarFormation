 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks naturally emerge during protostellar core-collapse. In their early evolutionary stages, infalling material dominates their dynamical evolution. In the context of planet formation, this means that the conditions in young disks are different from the typically considered disks where infall has subsided. High inward velocities are caused by the advection of accreted material which is deficient in angular momentum, rather than being set by viscous spreading, and accretion gives rise to strong velocity fluctuations. Therefore, we aim to investigate when it is possible for the first planetesimals to form and subsequent planet formation to commence. We analyze the disks obtained in numerical 3D nonideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations, which serve as a basis for 1D models representing the conditions during the Class 0/I evolutionary stages. We integrate the 1D models with an adapted version of the TwoPopPy code to investigate the formation of the first planetesimals via the streaming instability. In disks with temperatures such that the snow line is located at ~10 AU and where it is assumed that velocity fluctuations felt by the dust are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the gas, ${\sim}10^{-3}M_\odot$ of planetesimals may be formed already during the first 100 kyr after disk formation, implying the possible early formation of giant planet cores. The cold-finger effect at the snow line is the dominant driver of planetesimal formation, which occurs in episodes and utilizes solids supplied directly from the envelope, leaving the disk solid reservoir intact. However, if the cold-finger effect is suppressed, early planetesimal formation is limited to cold disks with efficient dust settling whose dust-to-gas ratio is initially enriched to $\epsilon_0\geq 0.03$.

 - **Abstract**
 Acetone (CH3COCH3) is one of the most abundant three-carbon oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (O-COMs) that have been detected in space. Recently, acetone ice has been reported as (tentatively) detected toward B1-c, which enables the gas-to-ice comparison of its abundances. The detection of acetone ice warrants a more systematic study of its gaseous abundances which is currently lacking. Therefore, we conducted systematic measurements of acetone gas in a dozen hot cores observed by the CoCCoA survey and investigate the chemical evolution from ice to gas of acetone in protostellar systems. We fit the ALMA spectra to determined the column density, excitation temperature, and line width of acetone, along with propanal (C2H5CHO), ketene (CH2CO), and propyne (CH3CCH), which might be chemically linked with acetone. We found that the observed gas abundances of acetone are surprisingly high compared to those of two-carbon O-COMs, while aldehydes are overall less abundant than other O-COMs (e.g., alcohols, ethers, and esters). This may suggest specific formation or destruction mechanisms that favor the production of ethers, esters, and ketones over aldehydes. The derived physical properties suggest that acetone, propanal, and ketene have the same origin from hot cores as other O-COMs, while propyne tends to trace the more extended outflows. The acetone-to-methanol ratios are higher in ice than in gas by one order of magnitude, hinting at gas-phase reprocessing after sublimation. There are several suggested formation pathways of acetone (in both ice and gas) from acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ketene, and propylene (C3H6). The observed ratios between acetone and the relevant species are rather constant across the sample, and can be well reproduced by astrochemical simulations, but more investigations are needed to draw solid conclusions.

 - **Abstract**
 Filament eruptions are magnetically driven violent explosions commonly observed on the Sun and late-type stars, sometimes leading to monster coronal mass ejections that directly affect the nearby planets' environments. More than a century of research on solar filaments suggests that the slow evolution of photospheric magnetic fields plays a decisive role in initiating filament eruptions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using high-resolution observations from the \textit{Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer}, the \textit{Solar Upper Transition Region Imager}, and the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we present direct evidence that a giant solar filament eruption is triggered by a series of minifilament eruptions occurring beneath it. These minifilaments, which are homologous to the giant filament but on a smaller tempo-spatial scale, sequently form and erupt due to extremely weak mutual flux disappearance of opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fields. Through multi-fold magnetic interactions, these erupting minifilaments act as the last straw to break the force balance of the overlying giant filament and initiate its ultimate eruption. The results unveil a possible novel pathway for small-scale magnetic activities near the stellar surface to initiate spectacular filament eruptions, and provide new insight into the magnetic coupling of filament eruptions across different tempo-spatial scales.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation mechanisms of open cluster (OCs) groups remain unclear due to limited sample sizes and data precision. Recent advancements in Gaia astrometric data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study OC groups in greater detail. This study aims to extend the sample of OC groups and investigate their formation and evolution mechanisms, with a focus on the role of stellar feedback in triggering star formation. We identify four new OC groups based on Gaia data, whose member OCs are spatially proximate and kinematically coherent. Their age spreads are consistent with the timescale of continuous star formation, suggesting that their member OCs formed sequentially from the same molecular cloud. N-body simulation results further reveal that these groups will gradually disperse, evolving into independent OCs. By analyzing the correlation between OC ages and their separation from potential SN explosion sites, we predict SN explosion regions around the birthplaces of OC groups. The strong correlation between OC ages and predicted SN explosion sites supports a supernova-triggered star formation scenario. Additionally, we trace pulsar (PSR) orbits to examine their association with these regions. We detected three PSRs near Group 1 and 26 PSRs near Group 2, whose birthplaces align with the predicted SN explosions regions. The presence of PSRs associated with OC groups provides additional observational evidence for SN explosions in this region, further supporting a supernova-triggered star formation scenario for G1 and G2. We propose that multiple SN explosions in a short period triggered the formation of Group 1 and Group 2, reinforcing the hierarchical star formation model. These results highlight the multi-scale interactions driving star and OC formation and provide new insights into the role of stellar feedback in shaping OC groups.

 - **Abstract**
 Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.
#### First JWST spectrum of distant activity in Long Period Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos)

 - **Abstract**
 We observed the new Long Period Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos), inbound at 7 au from the Sun, using the NIRSpec integral field unit on JWST. The spectrum shows absorption features due to water ice in the coma and evidence for CO$_2$ driven activity, with a production rate of $Q(CO_2) = 2.546 \pm 0.019 \times 10^{25}$ molecules s$^{-1}$, and no emission features of water or CO. The latter is surprising, given that CO is more volatile than CO$_2$, and suggests that this comet may have lost its near-surface CO during its early evolution, before implantation in the Oort cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the detection of a previously unknown giant molecular cloud (GMC) located at the midpoint of the Galactic Bar Dust Lanes (M4.7--0.8), using spectral line observations taken with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). This $\sim$60 pc long GMC is associated with accreting material that is transitioning from the quieter Galactic disk environment to the more extreme central molecular zone (CMZ) environment. Our 24 GHz single-dish radio observations targeted the NH$_3$ (1,1)$-$(4,4) and HC$_5$N (9$-$8), known dense gas tracers. The observations reveal the main features of the GMC, which we have dubbed the `Nexus' and `Filament', covering a 0$.\!\!^\circ$5$\times$0$.\!\!^\circ$25 area at 31$''$ angular resolution. In this publication we investigate the gas kinematics within the observed region and compare the distribution of molecular emission to previous infrared surveys to better understand the dust component. The observed gas tracers show centrally condensed cores corresponding to the positions of high dust column densities and low dust temperatures. We report the detection of a previously unknown NH$_3$ (3,3) maser, along with a 70$\mu$m source association, which supports the identification of this region as being actively star-forming. Gas emission in this region shows broad linewidths, comparable to values seen in CMZ clouds. The overall description of this cloud that we present is that of a highly dynamic region comprising dense gas and dust. This encapsulates a wide range of features associated with star formation, in addition to material transport related to the CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine parallax distances to nearby O stars with parsec-scale resolution three-dimensional dust maps of the local region of the Milky Way (within 1.25 kpc of the Sun) to simulate the transfer of Lyman continuum photons through the interstellar medium. Assuming a fixed gas-to-dust ratio, we determine the density of ionized gas, electron temperature, and H$\alpha$ emissivity throughout the local Milky Way. There is good morphological agreement between the predicted and observed H$\alpha$ all-sky map of the Wisconsin H$\alpha$ Mapper. We find that our simulation underproduces the observed H$\alpha$ emission while overestimating the sizes of HII regions, and we discuss ways in which agreement between simulations and observations may be improved. Of the total ionizing luminosity of $5.84 \times 10^{50}~{\rm photons~s^{-1}}$, 15% is absorbed by dust, 64% ionizes "classical'' HII regions, 11% ionizes the diffuse warm ionized medium, and 10% escapes the simulation volume. We find that 18% of the high altitude ($|b| > 30^{\circ}$) H$\alpha$ arises from dust-scattered rather than direct emission. These initial results provide an impressive validation of the three-dimensional dust maps and O-star parallaxes, opening a new frontier for studying the ionized ISM's structure and energetics in three dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Stream (MS) is a large tail of neutral and ionized gas originating from tidal and hydrodynamical interactions between the Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way (MW). It carries a significant gas reservoir that could impact the future evolution of the MW. Despite its importance, no direct observational constraints on the Stream's distance have been previously published. In this study, we analyze Very Large Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (VLT/UVES) spectra of five blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars in the MW halo located at distances ranging from 13 to 56 kpc near two regions of the Stream, with the aim of detecting Ca II and Na I absorption. No Ca II or Na I absorption is detected at Stream velocities in any of the individual spectra, or in higher signal-to-noise stacks of the spectra. The resulting limits on the Ca II absorption are significantly lower than the Ca II columns measured in the Stream along extragalactic directions. These non-detections establish a firm lower distance limit of 20 kpc for the two regions of the Stream studied. Ca II non-detections in the most distant stars yield tentative lower distance limits of 42 kpc and 55 kpc for the two regions, but deeper spectra are needed to confirm this. Our results provide the first observational constraints on the gaseous Stream's distance.

 - **Abstract**
 With the state-of-the-art Gaia astrometry, the number of confirmed white dwarfs has reached a few hundred thousand. We have reached the era where small features in the white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) of the solar neighbourhood can be resolved. We demonstrate how to apply Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling on a set of pre-computed partial-WDLFs to derive the star formation history of their progenitor stellar populations. We compare the results against many well-accepted and established works using various types of stars, including white dwarfs, main sequence stars, sub-giants and the entire stellar population. We find convincing agreements among most of the methods, particularly at the intermediate age of 0.1-9 Gyr.
#### Forming a clumpy circumstellar material in energetic pre-supernova activity

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate by three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of energy deposition into the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) model the inflation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable envelope that forms a compact clumpy circumstellar material (CSM). Our simulations mimic vigorous core activity years to months before a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion that deposits energy to the outer envelope. The fierce core nuclear activity in the pre-CCSN explosion phase might excite waves that propagate to the envelope. The wave energy is dissipated where envelope convection cannot carry the energy. We deposit this energy into a shell in the outer envelope with a power of L(wave)=2.6e6Lo or L(wave)=5.2e5Lo for 0.32 year. The energy-deposition shell expands while its pressure is higher than its surroundings, but its density is lower. Therefore, this expansion is Rayleigh-Taylor unstable and develops instability fingers. Most of the inflated envelope does not reach the escape velocity in the year of simulation but forms a compact and clumpy CSM. The high density of the inflated envelope implies that if a companion is present in that zone, it will accrete mass at a very high rate and power a pre-explosion outburst.
#### Origin of holes and rings in the Green Monster of Cassiopeia A: Insights from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Cassiopeia A (Cas A) provides a unique opportunity to study supernova (SN) dynamics and interactions with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Recent JWST observations revealed the "Green Monster" (GM), a structure with a likely CSM origin. We investigate its pockmarked morphology, characterized by circular holes and rings, by examining the role of small-scale ejecta structures interacting with a dense circumstellar shell. We adopted a neutrino-driven SN model to trace the evolution of its explosion from core collapse to the age of the Cas A remnant using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Besides other processes, the simulations include self-consistent calculations of radiative losses, accounting for deviations from electron-proton temperature equilibration and ionization equilibrium, as well as the ejecta composition derived from the SN. The GM's morphology is reproduced by dense ejecta clumps and fingers interacting with an asymmetric, forward-shocked circumstellar shell. The clumps and fingers form by hydrodynamic instabilities growing at the interface between SN ejecta and shocked CSM. Radiative cooling accounting for effects of non-equilibrium of ionization enhances the ejecta fragmentation, forming dense knots and thin filamentary structures that penetrate the shell, producing a network of holes and rings with properties similar to those observed. The origin of the holes and rings in the GM can be attributed to the interaction of ejecta with a shocked circumstellar shell. By constraining the timing of this interaction and analyzing the properties of these structures, we provide a distinction of this scenario from an alternative hypothesis, which attributes these features to fast-moving ejecta knots penetrating the shell ahead of the forward shock.
#### Low-Metallicity Star Formation Survey in Sh2-284 (LZ-STAR). I. Ordered massive star formation in the outer Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the Universe. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different galactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we introduce the Low-Metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284 (hereafter S284) region, which, at $Z\sim 0.3-0.5Z_\odot$, is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a multi-facility survey, including observations with {\it JWST}, {\it ALMA}, {\it HST}, {\it Chandra} and {\it Gemini}. As a starting point, we report {\it JWST} and {\it ALMA} observations of one of the most massive protostars in the region, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a symmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several parsecs, and fully covered by the {\it JWST} field of view and the {\it ALMA} observations of CO(2-1) emission. This allows us to infer that the protostar has maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its formation history. The {\it JWST} near-IR continuum observations detect a centrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a surrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer models of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting these models to the protostar's spectral energy distribution implies a current protostellar mass of $\sim11\:M_\odot$ has formed from an initially $\sim100\:M_\odot$ core over the last $\sim3\times10^5$ years. Overall, these results indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in low-metallicity, protocluster environments.
