 - **Abstract**
 Nova shells are the remnants of a nova eruption in a cataclysmic variable system. By studying their geometry we can better understand the physical mechanisms that shape them during the nova eruption. A nova shell that challenges our current understanding of these processes is the shell observed around V1425 Aql. It has at least two different components: an inner and symmetric shell, and an outer and asymmetric shell, with the latter expanding faster than the former. The physical reason behind the asymmetric ejecta is not clear. We aim to characterize the properties and differences between these two components to understand the origin behind the unusual shape. We acquired MUSE data to study the spatial position and kinematics of the expanding gas across the shell. Our analysis includes channel maps, position-velocity diagrams, and the reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the nova shell. Several emission lines are detected within the MUSE wavelength coverage, including but not limited to Balmer, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Helium lines. There are significant differences in the spectra of the inner and outer shells, with the latter being observed only in forbidden transitions, while the inner shows a mix of forbidden and allowed ones. Our analysis reveals that the outer shell has a geometry consistent with an arc-shaped structure that partially encircles the more spherical inner shell. Within the inner shell, clumpy structures start to be noticeable in the lines of H$\alpha$+[Nii]. We have constrained the geometry of the outer shell to an arc-shaped structure, although the physical reason behind its origin is still eluding us. Further monitoring of the evolution of both shells in this object might help to clarify the mechanism behind this unusual configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerous observations confirm the existence of dark matter (DM) at astrophysical and cosmological scales. Theory and simulations of galaxy formation predict that DM should cluster on small scales in bound structures called sub-halos or DM clumps. While the most massive DM sub-halos host baryonic matter, less massive, unpopulated sub-halos could be abundant in the Milky Way (MW), as well and yield high-energy gamma rays as final products of DM annihilation. Recently, it has been highlighted that the brightest halos should also have a sizeable extension in the sky. In this study, we examine the prospects offered by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray instrument, for detecting and characterizing such objects. Previous studies have primarily focused on high-latitude observations; here, we assess the potential impact of the CTAO's Galactic Plane Survey, which will provide unprecedentedly deep survey data for the inner five degrees of the Galactic plane. Our modeling accounts for tidal effects on the sub-halo population, examining the conditions under which DM sub-halos can be detected and distinguished from conventional astrophysical sources. We find that regions a few degrees above or below the Galactic plane offer the highest likelihood for DM sub-halo detection. For an individual sub-halo -- the brightest from among various realizations of the MW subhalo population -- we find that detection at the 5$\sigma$ level is achievable for an annihilation cross section of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 3\times10^{-25}$ cm$^3$/s for TeV-scale DM annihilating into $b\bar{b}$. For a full population study, depending on the distribution and luminosity model of Galactic sub-halos, yet unconstrained cross sections in the range $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-23}-10^{-22}$ cm$^3$/s for TeV DM candidates are necessary for the brightest sub-halos to be detected.
#### Cepheids in spectroscopic binary systems -- current status and recent discoveries

 - **Abstract**
 We present a summary of the current knowledge about Cepheids in binary systems. We focus on the most recent findings and discoveries, such as the highly increasing number of confirmed and candidate spectroscopic binary Cepheids and the progress in determining their physical parameters. This includes new and newly analyzed binary Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We will provide an update on the project to increase the number of the most valuable Cepheids in double-lined binary (SB2) systems from six to more than 100. To date, we have confirmed 60 SB2 systems, including detecting a significant orbital motion for 37. We identified systems with orbital periods up to five times shorter than the shortest period reported before and systems with mass ratios significantly different from unity (suggesting past binary interactions, including merger events). Both features are essential to understanding how multiplicity affects the formation and destruction of Cepheid progenitors and how this influences global Cepheid properties. We will also present nine new systems composed of two Cepheids. Only one such double Cepheid system was known before.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The emergence of mixed modes during the subgiant phase, whose frequencies are characterized by a fast evolution with age, can potentially enable a precise determination of stellar properties, a key goal for future missions like PLATO. However, current modelling techniques often consider grids that lack the resolution to properly account for the fast mode frequency evolution, consequently requiring the use of interpolation algorithms to cover the parameter space in between the grid models when applying model-data comparison methods. Aims. We aim at reproducing the $\ell$=1 mode frequencies within the accuracy limits associated with the typical observational errors ($\sim$0.1 $\mu$Hz) through interpolation on a grid of subgiant models. Methods. With that aim, we used variations of a two-step interpolation algorithm, which considered linear and cubic splines interpolation methods and different age proxies (physical age, scaled age, and central density). Results. The best results were obtained using an algorithm that considers cubic splines interpolation along tracks, linear interpolation across tracks, and central density $\rho_\text{c}$ as the age proxy. This combination yielded, on average, an absolute error of 0.14 $\mu$Hz, but reached maximum absolute errors on the interpolated frequencies of 1.2 $\mu$Hz for some models, which is an order of magnitude higher than the typical observational errors. Furthermore, we investigated the impact on the accuracy of the interpolation from changes in the physical properties of the stars, showing, in particular, how the addition of core overshoot can affect significantly the interpolation results.

 - **Abstract**
 Many close-in multiple-planet systems show a peas-in-a-pod trend, where neighbouring planets have similar sizes, masses, and orbital spacing. Others, including the Solar System, have a more diverse size and mass distribution. Classical planet formation models tend to produce the former rather than the latter, and the origin of this difference remains unclear. Recent studies suggest disc evolution is largely driven by magnetic winds rather than viscosity alone. In such wind-driven accretion discs, the mass accretion rate varies radially instead of being constant, as in classical viscous discs. We investigate how the wind's efficiency in removing disc mass affects planet formation and migration. We performed single-core planet formation simulations via pebble accretion in wind-driven accretion discs. We varied wind efficiency via the magnetic lever arm parameter $ \lambda $ and studied outcomes by considering a range of initial disc masses and accretion timescales. Our simulations show that higher $ \lambda $ discs, with less wind mass loss, lead to faster formation and migration, generating similar-mass planetary systems. Lower $ \lambda $ discs lead to slower formation and migration and more diverse-mass planetary systems. A mass jump occurs for all $ \lambda $ cases when planet formation and disc accretion timescales are comparable, but is larger for lower $ \lambda $ discs. Super-Earth systems with cold Jupiters form more frequently in metal-rich discs, consistent with observations. Our simulations suggest similar-mass and diverse-mass systems are approximately separated at $ \lambda \sim 2\text{--}3 $.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent ground- and space-based surveys have shown that planets between Earth and Neptune in size, known as "super-Earths," are among the most frequently found planets in the Galaxy. Although the JWST era has provided high-quality atmospheric data on several such super-Earths, modeling tools are crucial for understanding their unobservable interiors. Consequently, interior studies represent the next essential step in gaining a comprehensive understanding of this class of exoplanets. This study investigates the interior structure, thermal evolution, and atmospheric dynamics of the super-Earth GJ 486b using SERPINT, a 1-D self-consistent coupled interior structure and evolution model, aiming to understand the planet's thermal evolution based on an Earth-like structure. Our results indicate that GJ 486b's core is approximately 1.34 times larger than Earth's, with a core pressure of about 1171 GPa. The thermal evolution model predicts that the planet's mantle cools and solidifies over approximately 0.93 million years. As the magma ocean cools, water is released from the melt, forming a water-rich atmosphere during early solidification. Photolysis of water vapor and subsequent hydrogen escape lead to oxygen accumulation, forming a water- and oxygen-rich secondary atmosphere. Future high-sensitivity JWST observations, with improved wavelength coverage and the detection of additional trace gases, will enable a detailed analysis of the planet's atmospheric composition, providing crucial insights into the interior, surface, and subsurface properties of GJ 486b.

 - **Abstract**
 AGB stars are the primary source of dust and complex molecules in the interstellar medium. The determination of outflow parameters is often hindered by the unknown geometry of the circumstellar environment, creating a demand for high-angular resolution observations. We use our NIR spectra and photometry of the carbon AGB star V Cyg, along with literature data, to construct its SED over a wide range of wavelengths. The dust envelope responsible for the IR excess was also resolved in scattered polarized light at angular scales of 50-80 mas using differential speckle polarimetry. We present an interpretation of the thermal and scattered radiation of the dust using models of a spherical dusty outflow (Mdust = 5.3e-7 M_sun) and an inclined equatorial density enhancement, either in the form of a disk (Mdust = 7.6e-3 M_earth) or a torus (Mdust = 5.7e-3 M_earth), which material is concentrated at stellocentric distances less than 25 AU. The dust material consists of amorphous carbon and SiC, with 84% of the dust being amorphous carbon. Dust particle radii range from 5 to 950 nm and follow a power law with an exponent of -3.5. Modeling of the envelope allowed us to improve the accuracy of stellar luminosity estimations: 21000 L_sun and 8300 L_sun at maximum and minimum brightness, respectively. The relation between the disk and the high water content in the envelope is also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Flux emergence in the solar atmosphere is a complex process that causes a release of magnetic energy as heat and acceleration of solar plasma at a variety of spatial scales. Methods: We analysed imaging spectropolarimetric data taken in the He 1083 nm line. This line is sensitive to temperatures larger than 15 kK, unlike diagnostics such as \MgIIhk, \CaIIHK, and \Halpha, which lose sensitivity already at 15 kK. The He I data is complemented by imaging spectropolarimetry in the \CaIIK, \Feline, and \Caline\ lines. We employed inversions to determine the magnetic field and vertical velocity in the solar atmosphere. We computed He 1083 nm profiles from a radiation-MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere to help interpretation of the observations. Results: We find fast-evolving blob-like emission features in the He 1083 nm triplet at locations where the magnetic field is rapidly changing direction, and these are likely sites of magnetic reconnection. We fit the line with a model consisting of an emitting layer located below a cold layer representing the fibril canopy. The modelling provides evidence that this model, while simple, catches the essential characteristics of the line formation. The morphology of the emission in the He 1083 nm line is localized and blob-like, unlike the emission in the \CaIIK\ line, which is more filamentary. Conclusions: The modelling shows that the \Heline\ emission features and their Doppler shifts can be caused by opposite-polarity reconnection and/or horizontal current sheets below the canopy layer in the chromosphere. Based on the high observed Doppler width and the blob-like appearance of the emission features, we conjecture that at least a fraction of them are produced by plasmoids. We conclude that transition-region-like temperatures in the deeper layers of the active region chromosphere are more common than previously thought.

 - **Abstract**
 The hierarchical interplay among gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulent gas flows in delivering the necessary material to form massive protostellar clusters remains enigmatic. We have performed high-resolution (beam size $\sim$14 arcsec $\simeq$ 0.05 pc at a distance 725 pc) 850 $\mu$m dust polarization and C$^{18}$O molecular line observations of Cepheus A (Cep A), the second closest massive star-forming region, using the 15-meter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) along with the SCUBA-2/POL-2 and HARP instruments. Our key analyses reveal that (i) morphologically, all three fields--gravitational (G), magnetic (B), and kinetic (K) fields--are aligned with each other, and (ii) energetically, they exhibit a hierarchical relationship with gravitational ($E_{\mathrm{G}}$) > magnetic ($E_{\mathrm{B}}$) > kinetic ($E_{\mathrm{K}}$). Gravity dominates in Cep A clump and, as a primary active player, dictates the other two agents. Consequently, gravity plays two active roles: (i) induces gas flows and (ii) drags B-field lines toward the gravitational trough. Since magnetic energy dominates kinetic energy, $E_{\mathrm{B}}$ > $E_{\mathrm{K}}$, the "dragged-in" B-field as a secondary active player can mitigate turbulence and instabilities, thereby regularizing gas flows into a more ordered configuration. At the $\sim$0.60 pc clump scale, these flows deliver material at a substantially high rate of $\sim$ 2.1$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ toward the cluster center. Our study, for the first time, presents new insights into how B-fields and turbulent gas flows passively assist the active role of gravity in the formation of a protostellar cluster, contrasting with the standard notion that these agents primarily oppose gravitational collapse.
