 - **Abstract**
 votess is a library for computing parallel 3D Voronoi tessellations on heterogeneous platforms, from CPUs and GPUs, to future accelerator architectures. To do so, it leverages the SYCL abstraction layer to achieve portability and performance across these architectures. The core library is an implementation of a Voronoi cell-by-cell computation algorithm, producing the geometry of the cells and their neighbor connectivity information, rather than a full combinatorial mesh data structure. This simplifies the Voronoi tessellation and makes it more suitable to data parallel architectures than alternatives such as sequential insertion or the Bowyer-Watson algorithm. The library demonstrates significant performance improvements over established single-threaded programs and serves as a foundational tool for performance-critical applications, such as on-the-fly computations in hydrodynamical codes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Keck/KPIC phase II $K$-band observations of the non-transiting hot Jupiter HD 143105 b. Using a cross-correlation approach, we make the first detection of the planetary atmosphere at $K_p = 185^{+11}_{-13}\rm km\ s^{-1}$ and an inferior conjunction time 2.5 hours before the previously-published ephemeris. The retrieved $K_p$ value, in combination with orbital period, mass of the host star, and lack of transit detection, gives an orbital inclination of $78^{\circ+2}_{-12}$ and a true planet mass of 1.23$\pm0.10\rm\ M_J$. While the equilibrium temperature of HD 143105 b is in the transition regime between non-inverted and inverted atmospheres, our analysis strongly prefers a non-inverted atmosphere. Retrieval analysis indicates the atmosphere of HD 143105 b is cloud-free to approximately 1 bar and dominated by H$_2$O absorption ($\log \rm H_2O_{MMR} = -3.9^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$), placing only an upper limit on the CO abundance ($\log \rm CO_{MMR} < -3.7$ at 95% confidence). We place no constraints on the abundances of Fe, Mg, or $^{13}$CO. From these abundances, we place an upper limit on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio for HD 143105 b, $\rm C/O < 0.2$ at 95% confidence, and find the atmospheric metallicity is approximately $0.1\times$ solar. The low metallicity may be responsible for the lack of a thermal inversion, which at the temperature of HD 143105 b would likely require significant opacity from TiO and/or VO. With these results, HD 143105 b joins the small number of non-transiting hot Jupiters with detected atmospheres.
#### The lithium-rich giant stars puzzle: New observational trends for a general-mass-loss scenario

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of one percent of lithium-rich giant stars among normal, lithium-poor giant stars continues to be poorly explained. By merging two catalogues, one containing 10,535 lithium-rich giant stars with lithium abundances ranging from 1.5 to 4.9 dex, and the other detecting infrared sources, we have found 421 clump giant stars and 196 first-ascending giant stars with infrared excesses indicating stellar mass losses. The clump stars are the most lithium-rich. Approximately 5.8 percent of these stars episodically lose mass in periods of approximately 10^4 years or less, while the remaining stars ceased their mass loss and maintained their lithium for nearly 10^7 years. We propose a scenario in which all giant stars with masses below two solar masses undergo prompt lithium enrichment with mass-ejection episodes. We suggest that mass loss results from internal angular-momentum transport. It is possible that a transitory instability, perhaps of magnetic origin, rapidly transports the nuclear material responsible for the lithium enrichment to the stellar surface and triggers shell ejections. Additionally, the strong mass loss in some lithium-rich stars during their evolution activates their chromospheres, as observed in ultraviolet spectra. Furthermore, intense episodical mass losses in these stages led to the observable formation of complex organic and inorganic particles, as detected in near-infrared spectra. In contrast to first-ascending giant stars, helium flashes during the clump can contribute to additional lithium enrichment alongside the aforementioned process. The combination of these two lithium sources may explain the much higher observed lithium abundances in clump stars, as well as their observed infrared excesses. If our scenario based on a universal and rapid lithium enrichment episode process is correct, it could explain the rarity of lithium-rich giant stars.
#### PhaseTracer2: from the effective potential to gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the prospect of detecting gravitational waves sourced from a strongly first-order cosmological phase transition has emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers of gravitational wave astronomy. Cosmological phase transitions are an essential ingredient in the Standard Model of particle cosmology, and help explain the mechanism for creation of matter in the early Universe, provide insights into fundamental theories of physics, and shed light on the nature of dark matter. This underscores the significance of developing robust end-to-end tools for determining the resulting gravitational waves from these phase transitions. In this article we present PhaseTracer2, an improved version of the C++ software package PhaseTracer, designed for mapping cosmological phases and transitions in Standard Model extensions of multiple scalar fields. Building on the robust framework of its predecessor, PhaseTracer2 extends its capabilities by including new features crucial for a more comprehensive analysis of cosmological phase transitions. It can calculate more complex properties, such as the bounce action through the path deformation method or an interface with BubbleProfiler, thermodynamic parameters, and gravitational wave spectra. Its applicability has also been broadened via incorporating the dimensionally reduced effective potential for models obtained from DRalgo, as well as calculations in the MSbar and OS-like renormalisation schemes. This modular, flexible, and practical upgrade retains the speed and stability of the original PhaseTracer, while significantly expanding its utility.
#### Impact of Two-Population $\alpha$-particle Distributions on Plasma Stability

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of weakly collisional plasmas is well represented by linear theory, and the generated waves play an essential role in the thermodynamics of these systems. The velocity distribution functions (VDF) characterizing kinetic particle behavior are commonly represented as a sum of anisotropic bi-Maxwellians. For the majority of in situ observations of solar wind plasmas enabled by heliospheric missions, a three bi-Maxwellian model is commonly applied for the ions, assuming that the VDF consists of a proton core, proton beam, and a single He ($\alpha$) particle population, each with their own density, bulk velocity, and anisotropic temperature. Resolving an $\alpha$-beam component was generally not possible due to instrumental limitations. The Solar Orbiter Solar Wind Analyser Proton and Alpha Sensor (SWA PAS) resolves velocity space with sufficient coverage and accuracy to routinely characterize secondary $\alpha$ populations consistently. This design makes the SWA PAS dataset ideal for examining effects of the $\alpha$-particle beam on the plasma's kinetic stability. We test the wave signatures observed in the magnetic field power spectrum at ion scales and compare them to the predictions from linear plasma theory, Doppler-shifted into the spacecraft reference frame. We find that taking into account the $\alpha$-particle beam component is necessary to predict the coherent wave signatures in the observed power spectra, emphasizing the importance of separating the $\alpha$-particle populations as is traditionally done for protons. Moreover, we demonstrate that the drifts of beam components are responsible for the majority of the modes that propagate in oblique direction to the magnetic field, while their temperature anisotropies are the primary source of parallel Fast Magnetosonic Modes in the solar wind.
#### Eta-Earth Revisited II: Deriving a Maximum Number of Earth-like Habitats in the Galactic Disk

 - **Abstract**
 In Lammer et al. 2024, we defined Earth-like Habitats (EH) as rocky planets in the habitable zone of complex life (HZCL) on which Earth-like N$_2$-O$_2$-dominated atmospheres with minor amounts of CO$_2$ can exist and derived a formula for estimating their maximum number in the Galaxy. Here, we apply this formula by considering only requirements that are already scientifically quantifiable. By implementing models for star formation rate, initial mass function, and galactic mass distribution, we calculate the spatial distribution of disk stars as functions of stellar mass and birth age. We apply models for the GHZ and evaluate the thermal stability of Earth-like atmospheres with various CO$_2$ mixing ratios by implementing the newest stellar evolution and upper atmosphere models. In addition, we include the rocky exoplanet frequency, the availability of oceans and subaerial land, and the potential large moon requirement by evaluating their importance and implementing these criteria from minima to maxima values. We also discuss factors that are not yet scientifically quantifiable but may be requirements for EHs to evolve. We find that EHs are rare by obtaining maximum numbers of $2.5^{+71.6}_{-2.4}\times10^{5}$ and $0.6^{+27.1}_{-0.59}\times10^{5}$ planets that can potentially host N$_2$-Earth-like atmospheres with maximum CO$_2$ mixing ratios of 10\% and 1\%, respectively, implying that a minimum of $\sim 10^3 - 10^6$ rocky HZCL planets are needed for 1 EH to evolve. Their actual number, however, may be substantially lower as several requirements are not included in our model; this also implies ETIs are significantly rarer still. Our results illustrate that neither every star can host EHs, nor that each rocky HZCL planet evolves such that it may be able to host complex animal-like life. The Copernican Principle therefore cannot be applied to infer that such life is common in the Galaxy.
#### Open Cluster Study Using $Gaia$ I:Membership and Cluster Properties

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters are interesting laboratories to study star formation, single and binary stellar evolution, and stellar dynamics. We have used the exquisite data from $Gaia$'s data release 3 (DR3) to study 21 relatively rich and nearby open clusters with member numbers ($N_{\rm{cl}}$)$>500$. We have developed a non-parametric method to identify cluster members. Our method works well for clusters located in both sparse and crowded environments, hence, can be applied to a wide variety of star clusters. Since the member classification scheme does not make any assumptions on the expected distributions of potential cluster members, our method can identify members associated with clusters that are oddly shaped or have complex internal spatial or kinematic structures. In addition, since the membership determination does not depend on the proximity to any well-defined sequences on the color-magnitude diagram, this method easily identifies straggler members. Furthermore, for each of these clusters, we estimate essential cluster properties including age, metallicity, distance, and reddening using detailed Markov-Chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation. We report the full posteriors for these important cluster properties for all clusters in our study.

 - **Abstract**
 Although Cherenkov detectors of high-energy neutrinos in ice and water are often optimized to detect TeV-PeV neutrinos, they may also be sensitive to transient neutrino sources in the 1-100~GeV energy range. A wide variety of transient sources have been predicted to emit GeV neutrinos. In light of the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade, which will extend the IceCube detector's sensitivity down to a few GeV, as well as improve its angular resolution, we survey a variety of transient source models and compare their predicted neutrino fluences to detector sensitivities, in particular those of IceCube-DeepCore and the IceCube Upgrade. We consider the ranges of neutrino fluence from transients powered by non-relativistic shocks, such as novae, supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and tidal disruption events. We also consider fast radio bursts and relativistic outflows of high- and low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts. Our study sheds light on the prospects of observing GeV transients with existing and upcoming neutrino facilities.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroseismic inferences of main-sequence solar-like oscillators often rely on best-fit models. However, these models cannot fully reproduce the observed mode frequencies, suggesting that the internal structure of the model does not fully match that of the star. Asteroseismic structure inversions provide a way to test the interior of our stellar models. Recently, structure inversion techniques were used to study 12 stars with radiative cores. In this work, we extend that analysis to 43 main-sequence stars with convective cores observed by Kepler to look for differences in the sound speed profiles in the inner 30% of the star by radius. For around half of our stars, the structure inversions show that our models reproduce the internal structure of the star, where the inversions are sensitive, within the observational uncertainties. For the stars where our inversions reveal significant differences, we find cases where our model sound speed is too high and cases where our model sound speed is too low. We use the star with the most significant differences to explore several changes to the physics of our model in an attempt to resolve the inferred differences. These changes include using a different overshoot prescription and including the effects of diffusion, gravitational settling, and radiative levitation. We find that the resulting changes to the model structure are too small to resolve the differences shown in our inversions.
