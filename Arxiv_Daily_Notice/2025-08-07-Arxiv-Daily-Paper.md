 - **Abstract**
 Two nearby B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), are important contributors to the photoionization of the local interstellar clouds. At spectral type B1 II-III, $\beta$ CMa is slightly hotter than $\epsilon$ CMa (B2 II-III), but its ionizing flux at Earth is attenuated by a much larger H I column density. At the external surface of the clouds, the two stars produce similar fluxes in the Lyman continuum (LyC). From the $\beta$ CMa angular diameter, bolometric flux, and position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we obtain a consistent set of stellar parameters: $T_{\rm eff} = 25,180\pm1120$ K, $\log g = 3.70\pm0.08$, radius $R = 8.44\pm0.56\,R_{\odot}$, mass $M = 13\pm1\,M_{\odot}$, and luminosity $L = 10^{4.41\pm0.06}\, L_{\odot}$. The EUVE-observed fluxes and non-LTE model atmospheres are used to determine the ionizing photon production rate $Q_{\rm H} = 10^{46.0}$ photons s$^{-1}$ and fluxes incident on the local clouds, $\Phi_{\rm HI} \approx 3700$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\Phi_{\rm HeI} \approx 110$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the H I and He I continua. The corresponding photoionization rates are $\Gamma_{\rm HI} \approx 1.5\times10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm HeI} \approx 7.3\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. Within the local cloud, the LyC flux is attenuated by an H I column density $N_{\rm HI} = (1.9\pm0.1)\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, with optical depth $\tau_{\rm LL} = 12.0\pm 0.6$ at the Lyman limit. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun approximately 4.4 Myr ago, with incident ionizing fluxes 180-200 times larger. Their EUV radiation photoionized and heated the tunnel in the local interstellar gas, associated dynamically with past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of binary black hole (BH) mergers remains a topic of active debate, with effective spins (chi_eff) measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration providing crucial insights. In this study, our objective is to investigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin components) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations, assuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of formation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the effect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation. We employ simple yet robust Monte Carlo simulations of the final core collapse forming the second-born BH, using minimal assumptions to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The synthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK science runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations, and three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We find strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK sources are dominated by the isolated binary channel. Simulations with spin-axis tossing achieve high p-values (up to 0.882) using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, while without tossing, all p-values drop below 0.001 for isolated binaries. A statistically acceptable solution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH mergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions. Finally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal in ~30% of the progenitor binaries. Predictions from this study can be tested with LVK O4+O5 data as well as the 3G detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, enabling improved constraints on formation channel ratios and the critical question of BH spin-axis tossing.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observed our closest solar twin, $\alpha$ Cen A, with the MIRI coronagraph in F1550C (15.5 $\mu$m) at three distinct epochs between August 2024 and April 2025. For the first time with JWST, we demonstrate the application of reference star differential imaging to simultaneously subtract the coronagraphic image of a primary star and the point spread function (PSF) of its binary companion to conduct a deep search for exoplanets and dust emission. We achieve a typical 5$\sigma$ point source contrast sensitivity between $\sim$$10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ at separations $\gtrsim$ 1" and an exozodiacal disk (coplanar with $\alpha$ Cen AB) sensitivity of $\sim$5-8$\times$ the Solar System's zodiacal cloud around $\alpha$ Cen A. The latter is an extraordinary limit, representing the deepest sensitivity to exozodiacal disks achieved for any stellar system to date. Post-processing with the PCA-KLIP algorithm reveals a point source, called $S1$, in August 2024, detected at S/N $=$ 4-6 (3.3-4.3$\sigma$), a separation of $\approx$1.5" (2 au), and with a F1550C flux (contrast) of $\approx$3.5 mJy ($\approx 5.5 \times 10^{-5}$). Various tests conducted with the data show that $S1$ is unlikely to be a detector or PSF subtraction artifact and confirm that it is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not re-detected in the two follow-up observations (February and April 2025). If $S1$ is astrophysical in nature, the only explanation is that it has moved to a region of poor sensitivity due to orbital motion. We perform PSF injection-recovery tests and provide 2D sensitivity maps for each epoch to enable orbital completeness calculations. Additional observations are necessary to re-detect candidate $S1$ and confirm its nature as a planet orbiting our nearest solar-type neighbor.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on coronagraphic observations of the nearest solar-type star, $\alpha$ Cen A, using the MIRI instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. With three epochs of observation (August 2024, February 2025, and April 2025), we achieve a sensitivity sufficient to detect $T_{\rm eff}\approx$ 225-250 K (1-1.2 $R_{\rm Jup}$) planets between 1"-2" and exozodiacal dust emission at the level of $>$5-8$\times$ the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud. The lack of exozodiacal dust emission sets an unprecedented limit of a few times the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud$-$a factor of $\gtrsim$10 more sensitive than measured toward any other stellar system to date. In August 2024, we detected a F$_\nu$(15.5 $\mu$m) = 3.5 mJy point source, called $S1$, at a separation of 1.5" from $\alpha$ Cen A. Because the August 2024 epoch had only one successful observation at a single roll angle, it is not possible to unambiguously confirm $S1$ as a bona fide planet. Our analysis confirms that $S1$ is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not recovered in the February and April 2025 epochs. However, if $S1$ is the counterpart of the object, $C1$, seen by the VLT/NEAR program in 2019, we find that there is a 52% chance that the $S1+C1$ candidate was missed in both follow-up JWST/MIRI observations due to orbital motion. Incorporating constraints from the non-detections, we obtain families of dynamically stable orbits for $S1+C1$ with periods between 2-3 years. These suggest that the planet candidate is on an eccentric ($e \approx 0.4$) orbit significantly inclined with respect to $\alpha$ Cen AB orbital plane ($i_{\rm mutual} \approx 50^\circ$, or $\approx 130^\circ$). Based on the photometry and orbital properties, the planet candidate could have a temperature of 225 K, a radius of $\approx$1-1.1 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and a mass between 90-150 $M_{\rm Earth}$, consistent with RV limits.

 - **Abstract**
 The power spectrum of light curves from satellites like CoRoT and TESS of massive main-sequence stars have shown stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability or excess power in the low frequency regime. To investigate the origin of this phenomenon, we conducted high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic \texttt{PPMstar} simulations of a non-rotating $25 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ zero-age main sequence star, modeling 95\% of the stellar structure with both core and thin outer envelope convection zones. The thin outer envelope convection zone was implemented through modification of the opacity model, shifting the Fe opacity bump inward and enhancing its amplitude to ensure computational feasibility. The luminosity power spectrum from our primary simulation (M424) exhibits qualitative and quantitative characteristics similar to observed SLF variability, with a two-order-of-magnitude difference between high and low frequencies matching observational data. The spectrum displays distinct features attributable to internal gravity waves (IGWs) evanescent in the thin outer envelope convection zone, originating from the thin outer envelope convective boundary. To isolate the contributions of different stellar regions, we performed controlled numerical experiments with suppressed core convection, envelope convection and thin outer envelope-only configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that thin outer envelope convection alone produces significantly less power at low frequencies than the full-star configuration. Our results indicate that IGWs excited at the thin outer envelope convection inner boundary and interacting with the thin outer envelope convection are the dominant contributors to SLF variability in our simulations. The IGW spectral characteristics depend on the complete stellar stratification, demonstrating that interior structure could influence observable surface variability.

 - **Abstract**
 We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of four Luminous Red Novae (LRNe): dusty, extragalactic transients from stellar mergers following common-envelope evolution (CEE) in massive binary stars. Our targets - AT2021blu, AT2021biy, AT2018bwo, and M31-LRN-2015 - span a broad range in progenitor primary masses ($\approx$3-24M$_{\odot}$) and post-merger ages ($\approx$1100-3700 days). All four were observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) from 5-25$\mu$m; AT2021blu and AT2021biy additionally have 5-12$\mu$m spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer. These spectra show strong features of oxygen-rich molecules, including water vapor, supporting the recent association of water fountain sources with CEE. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distributions yields dust masses of $\approx$4.2$\times10^{-5}$, 3$\times10^{-4}$, 7.5$\times10^{-5}$, and 7.7$\times10^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$ respectively - corresponding to $\approx10$%, 60%, 6% and 12% of median dust masses in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) at similar phases. Accounting for their occurrence rates, we estimate that LRNe can contribute $\sim$25% as much dust as CCSNe to the cosmic dust budget. Furthermore, the lower expansion velocities of LRNe may reduce dust destruction by reverse shocks compared to CCSNe, potentially increasing this contribution. In addition to dust masses, we use our \emph{JWST} observations to measure late-time properties such as the luminosities, temperatures, radii, and dust-to-gas ratios of the merger remnants. Our results highlight the need for broader infrared studies of LRNe to quantify their contribution to the cosmic dust budget, study the evolution of oxygen-rich molecules, and probe the final fates of CEE.

 - **Abstract**
 Main-sequence dipper stars, characterized by irregular and often aperiodic luminosity dimming events, offer a unique opportunity to explore the variability of circumstellar material and its potential links to planet formation, debris disks, and broadly star-planet interactions. The advent of all-sky time-domain surveys has enabled the rapid discovery of these unique systems. We present the results of a large systematic search for main-sequence dipper stars, conducted across a sample of 63 million FGK main-sequence stars using data from Gaia eDR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. Using a novel light curve scoring algorithm and a scalable workflow tailored for analyzing millions of light curves, we have identified 81 new dipper star candidates. Our sample reveals a diverse phenomenology of light curve dimming shapes, such as skewed and symmetric dimmings with timescales spanning days to years, some of which closely resemble exaggerated versions of KIC 8462852. Our sample reveals no clear periodicity patterns sensitive to ZTF in many of these dippers and no infrared excess or irregular variability. Using archival data collated for this study, we thoroughly investigate several classification scenarios and hypothesize that the mechanisms of such dimming events are either driven by circumstellar clumps or occultations by stellar/sub-stellar companions with disks. Our study marks a significant step forward in understanding main-sequence dipper stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present precise parameters for two compact double white dwarf binaries, SDSS J232230.20+050942.0 (J2322+0509) and SDSS J063449.92+380352.2 (J0634+3803), with orbital periods of 20 and 26.5 minutes, respectively. These systems will serve as verification sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). To significantly improve the electromagnetic (EM) constraints on these two systems and the LISA detectability predictions, we conducted spectroscopic follow-up observations using HST/STIS, Keck I/LRIS, and Keck II/ESI. Our analysis significantly improves the temperature, surface gravity, and mass constraints for both primary and secondary components in J2322+0509, as well as dynamical properties such as radial velocities and orbital periods in both systems. For J2322+0509, we derive an updated inclination of $i$ = 25$^{+4.5}_{-3.0}$ deg, while for J0634+3803, we obtain $i$ = 43$^{+7.0}_{-5.6}$ deg. We assess the detectability of these sources using LDASOFT. Incorporating EM priors on inclination significantly enhances the gravitational wave signal recovery, reducing uncertainties in amplitude by a factor of 2-4 and shortening the detection time by up to a few months. Our results underscore the importance of multi-messenger observations in characterizing double white dwarf binaries and maximizing LISA's early scientific capabilities.

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) $R$-modes are oscillations in rotating stars, primarily restored by the Coriolis force. These oscillations are the most susceptible to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability driven by gravitational wave emission, which makes them promising targets for current and future gravitational wave searches. In order to develop, the instability must overcome dissipative processes within the star. As a result, $r$-modes become unstable only for certain combinations of stellar angular velocity $\Omega$ and (redshifted) temperature $T^\infty$, defining the so-called instability window on the $(\Omega, T^\infty)$ plane. At high temperatures, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, arising from out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions, is the dominant dissipative agent. Dissipation due to $\zeta$ can be greatly enhanced by two independent mechanisms: (1) the presence of hyperons, which significantly increases the bulk viscosity, and (2) the distinctive properties of relativistic $r$-modes in nonbarotropic matter, which further amplify dissipation beyond Newtonian predictions. In this work, we present the first investigation of the combined impact of these mechanisms on $r$-mode instability windows. Our calculations also account for the fact that chemical reactions modify the adiabatic index, in addition to producing bulk viscosity. We further estimate the influence of nucleon pairing effects on the instability windows. By comparing our predictions with recent observations of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we find that bulk viscosity in hyperonic matter may provide the necessary dissipation to stabilize $r$-modes in the fastest-spinning and moderately hot stars, even when nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity are taken into account. These results have important implications for the interpretation of observations and for the broader understanding of relativistic $r$-mode physics.
#### Magnetized Proto-Neutron Stars: Structure and Stability

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the evolution of the global properties of magnetized proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across four key stages: neutrino-trapping, deleptonization, the neutrino-transparent phase, and the formation of a cold, catalyzed neutron star (NS). We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with strong magnetic fields of approximately 10^17 Gauss. The stellar matter is modeled using equations of state (EoS) derived from relativistic mean-field theory, employing density-dependent couplings calibrated by the DDME2 parameterization. We analyze how the gravitational mass, equatorial radius, shape deformation, magnetic flux, and the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio evolve in response to changes in internal composition, thermodynamic conditions, and magnetic field configuration. Our results show that as PNSs evolve, increasing entropy per baryon and decreasing lepton fractions lead to higher core temperatures. These thermodynamic changes enhance the star's susceptibility to magnetic field-induced deformation, facilitate greater magnetic flux confinement, and increase the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio, especially during the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases. The PNS's core temperature also determines the efficiency of magnetic field decay. We find that dissipation is fastest during the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases, a process that ultimately defines the observable magnetic field of the mature NS.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark sector interactions can be explored via the so-called Type 3 model where dark matter and dark energy exchange momentum only, so as to minimize deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history. Using N-body simulations, we analyze the imprint of Type 3 model parameters, the momentum exchange coupling constant $\beta$ and the slope of scalar field potential $\lambda$, on large-scale structure (LSS) observables, particularly the matter pairwise velocity statistics. We find that the effects of $\beta$ ($< 0$) and $\lambda$ on the mean matter peculiar pairwise velocity and velocity dispersion are degenerate. Our results highlight the potential of velocity statistics as a probe of dark sector interactions and underscore the importance of disentangling $\beta$ and $\lambda$ in cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between 12-20 Msun focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss ~10^-4-10^-2 Msun/yr in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM (>~10^-15 g/cm^3 at distances <~10^15 cm) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large-Area Central Molecular Zone Exploration (FIREPLACE) survey with SOFIA has mapped plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientations within the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way. Applying the Histogram of Relative Orientation (HRO) analysis to the FIREPLACE data, we find that the relative orientation between magnetic fields and column density structures is random in low-density regions (2x10^22<N(H2)<10^23 cm^{-2}), but becomes preferentially parallel in high-density regions (>10^23 cm^{-2}). This trend is in contrast with that of the nearby molecular clouds, where the relative orientation transitions from parallel to perpendicular with increasing column densities. However, the relative orientation varies between individual CMZ clouds. Comparisons with MHD simulations specific to the CMZ conditions suggest that the observed parallel alignment is intrinsic rather than artifacts caused by the projection effect. The origin of this parallel configuration may arise from the fact that most dense structures in the CMZ are not self-gravitating, as they are in super-virial states, except for the mini-starburst region Sgr B2. These findings are consistent with the low star formation efficiency observed in the CMZ compared to that in the Galactic disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV) and image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is under-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational imaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive optics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use the AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely controlled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images that exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then be jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we show this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO operation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate end-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the upsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal statistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our experimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations, demonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO super-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no hardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a complete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily transferred to an operational telescope.
