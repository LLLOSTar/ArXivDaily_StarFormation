 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the fractal dimension of open clusters using 3D spatial data from Gaia DR3 for 93 open clusters from Pang et al. (2024) and 127 open clusters from Hunt & Reffert (2024) within 500 pc. The box-counting method is adopted to calculate the fractal dimension of each cluster in three regions: the all-member region, $r \leq r_t$ (inside the tidal radius), and $r > r_t$ (outside the tidal radius). In both the Pang and Hunt catalogs, the fractal dimensions are smaller for the regions $r > r_t$ than those for $r \leq r_t$, indicating that the stellar distribution is more clumpy in the cluster outskirts. We classify cluster morphology based on the fractal dimension via the Gaussian Mixture Model. Our study shows that the fractal dimension can efficiently classify clusters in the Pang catalog into two groups. The fractal dimension of the clusters in the Pang catalog declines with age, which is attributed to the development of tidal tails. This is consistent with the expectations from the dynamical evolution of open clusters. We find strong evidence that the fractal dimension increases with cluster mass, which implies that higher-mass clusters are formed hierarchically from the mergers of lower-mass filamentary-type stellar groups. The transition of the fractal dimension for the spatial distribution of open clusters provides a useful tool to trace the Galactic star forming structures, from the location of the Local Bubble within the solar neighborhood to the spiral arms across the Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Low-mass bodies, such as comets, asteroids, planetesimals, and free-floating planets, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems. These can be modeled as massless particles (MLPs, hereafter). The dynamics of large populations of MLPs, however, has yet received little attention in literature. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of MLP populations in star clusters, and characterize their kinematics and ejection rates. Methods. We present NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS, a modified version of the N-body simulation code NBODY6++GPU, that allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles (MLPs). NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS contains routines specifically directed at the dynamical evolution of low-mass bodies, such as planets. Results. Unlike stars, MLPs do not participate in the mass segregation process. Instead, MLPs mostly follow the gravitational potential of the star cluster, which gradually decreases over time due to stellar ejections and stellar evolution. The dynamical evolution of MLPs is primarily affected by the evolution of the core of the star cluster. This is most apparent in the outer regions for clusters with higher initial densities. High escape rates of MLPs are observed before the core-collapse, after which escape rates remain stable. Denser star clusters undergo a more intense core collapse, but this does not impact the dynamical evolution of MLPs. The speeds of escaping stars are similar to those of escaping MLPs, when disregarding the high-velocity ejections of neutron stars during the first 50 Myr.

 - **Abstract**
 A complete understanding of the initial conditions of high-mass star formation and what processes determine multiplicity require the study of the magnetic field (B-field) in young, massive cores. Using ALMA 250 GHz polarization (0.3" = 1000 au) and ALMA 220 GHz high-angular resolution observations (0.05" = 160 au), we have performed a full energy analysis including the B-field at core scales and have assessed what influences the multiplicity inside a massive core previously believed to be in the prestellar phase. With 31 Msun, the G11.92 MM2 core has a young CS outflow with a dynamical time scale of a few thousand years. At high-resolution, the MM2 core fragments into a binary system with a projected separation of 505 au and a binary mass ratio of 1.14. Using the DCF method with an ADF analysis, we estimate in this core a B-field strength of 6.2 mG and a mass-to-flux ratio of 18. The MM2 core is strongly subvirialized with a virial parameter of 0.064, including the B-field. The high mass-to-flux ratio and low virial parameter indicate that this massive core is very likely undergoing runaway collapse, which is in direct contradiction with the core-accretion model. The MM2 core is embedded in a filament that has a velocity gradient consistent with infall. In line with clump-fed scenarios, the core can grow in mass at a rate of 1.9--5.6 x 10^-4 Msun/yr. In spite of the B-field having only a minor contribution to the total energy budget at core scales, it likely plays a more important role at smaller scales by setting the binary properties. Considering energy ratios and a fragmentation criterion at the core scale, the binary could have been formed by core fragmentation. The binary properties (separation and mass ratio), however, are also consistent with radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations with super-Alfvenic, supersonic (or sonic) turbulence that form binaries by disk fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of Gaia, the accurate determination of stellar ages is transforming Galactic archaeology. We demonstrate the feasibility of inferring stellar ages from Gaia's RVS spectra and the BP/RP (XP) spectrophotometric data, specifically for red giant branch and high-mass red clump stars. We successfully train two machine learning models, dubbed SIDRA: Stellar age Inference Derived from Gaia spectRA to predict the age. The SIDRA-RVS model uses the RVS spectra and SIDRA-XP the stellar parameters obtained from the XP spectra by Fallows and Sanders 2024. Both models use BINGO, an APOGEE-derived stellar age from Ciuca et al. 2021 as the training data. SIDRA-RVS estimates ages of stars whose age is around $\tau_\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr with a standard deviation of residuals of $\sim$ 0.12 dex in the unseen test dataset, while SIDRA-XP achieves higher precision with residuals $\sim$ 0.064 dex for stars around $\tau_\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr. Since SIDRA-XP outperforms SIDRA-RVS, we apply SIDRA-XP to analyse the ages for 2,218,154 stars. This allowed us to map the chronological and chemical properties of Galactic disc stars, revealing distinct features such as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger and a potential gas-rich interaction event linked to the first infall of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. This study demonstrates that machine learning techniques applied to Gaia's spectra can provide valuable age information, particularly for giant stars, thereby enhancing our understanding of the Milky Way's formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Brown dwarfs are the bridge between low-mass stars and giant planets. One way of shedding light on their dominant formation mechanism is to study them at the earliest stages of their evolution, when they are deeply embedded in their parental clouds. Several works have identified pre- and proto-brown dwarfs candidates using different observational approaches. The aim of this work is to create a database with all the objects classified as very young substellar candidates in the litearature in order to study them in an homogeneous way. We have gathered all the information about very young substellar candidates available in the literature until 2020. We have retrieved their published photometry from the optical to the centimeter regime, and we have written our own codes to derive their bolometric temperatures and luminosities, and their internal luminosities. We have also populated the database with other parameters extracted from the literature, like e.g. the envelope masses, their detection in some molecular species, and presence of outflows. The result of our search is the SUCANES database, containing 174 objects classified as potential very young substellar candidates in the literature. We present an analysis of the main properties of the retrieved objects. Since we have updated the distances to several star forming regions, this has allowed us to reject some candidates based on their internal luminosities. We have also discussed the derived physical parameters and envelope masses for the best substellar candidates isolated in SUCANES. As an example of a scientific exploitation of this database, we present a feasibility study for the detection of radiojets with upcoming facilities: the ngVLA and the SKA interferometers. The SUCANES database is accessible through a Graphical User Interface and it is open to any potential user.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock waves from supernova remnants (SNRs) have strong influence on the physical and chemical properties of molecular clouds (MCs). Shocks propagating into magnetized MCs can be classified into "jump" J-shock and "continuous" C-shock. The molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas behind J-shock is still not well understood, which will provide a comprehensive view of the chemical feedback of SNRs and the chemical effects of J-shock. We conducted a W-band (71.4-89.7 GHz) observation toward a re-formed molecular clump behind a J-shock induced by SNR W51C with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope to study the molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas. Based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we estimate the column densities of HCO+, HCN, C2H and o-c-C3H2, and derive the maps of their abundance ratios with CO. The gas density is constrained by non-LTE analysis of the HCO+ J=1-0 line. We obtain the following abundance ratios: $N({\rm HCO^+})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.0\text{--}4.0)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm HCN})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.8\text{--}5.3)\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\rm C_2H})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.6\text{--}5.0)\times 10^{-3}$, and $N({o\text{-}c\text{-}{\rm C_3H_2}})/N({\rm CO})\sim (1.2\text{--}7.9)\times 10^{-4}$. The non-LTE analysis suggests that the gas density is $n_{\rm H_2}\gtrsim 10^4\rm \ cm^{-3}$. We find that the N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO) are higher than typical values in quiescent MCs and shocked MCs by 1-2 orders of magnitude, which can be qualitatively attributed to the abundant C+ and C at the earliest phase of molecular gas re-formation. The Paris-Durham shock code can reproduce, although not perfectly, the observed abundance ratios, especially the enhanced N(C2H)/N(CO) and N(o-c-C3H2)/N(CO), with J-shocks propagating in to both non-irradiated and irradiated molecular gas with a preshock density of $n_{\rm H}=2\times 10^3\rm \ cm^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The solar corona is highly structured by bunches of magnetic field lines forming either loops, or twisted flux ropes representing prominences/filaments, or very dynamic structures such as jets. The aim of this paper is to understand the interaction between filament channels and jets. We use high-resolution H$\alpha$ spectra obtained by the ground-based Telescope Heliographique pour lEtude du Magnetisme et des Instabilites Solaires (THEMIS) in Canary Islands, and data from Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). In this paper we present a multi-wavelength study of the interaction of filaments and jets. They both consist of cool plasma embedded in magnetic structures. A jet is particularly well studied in all the AIA channels with a flow reaching 100-180 km s$^{-1}$. Its origin is linked to cancelling flux at the edge of the active region. Large Dopplershifts in H$\alpha$ are derived in a typical area for a short time (order of min). They correspond to flows around 140 km s$^{-1}$. In conclusion we conjecture that these flows correspond to some interchange of magnetic field lines between the filament channel and the jets leading to cool plasmoid ejections or reconnection jets perpendicularly to the jet trajectory.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended main-sequence stars that are dim in the ultraviolet passbands of Hubble Space Telescope (UV-dim stars) are found in several young and intermediate-age Magellanic Cloud star clusters. The obscuring of the dust in the discs of stars expelled due to fast rotation have been suggested to be responsible for the appearance of UV-dim stars, and play an important role in the formation of extended main-sequences. In this paper, we report a population of A- and F-type stars who show H{\alpha} emission features in their spectra in a young (~ 340 Myr-old) Galactic neighboring star cluster NGC 3532. By fitting the observed absorption profiles, we found that most H{\alpha} emitters are fast rotating stars, indicating that they form decretion discs by fast rotation like Be stars. As A- and F-type stars dominate the extended main-sequence turn-off regions of intermediate-age clusters, their appearance provides observational evidence to support the dust extinction scenario for these clusters, and might be the counterparts of UV-dim stars that are detected in remote Magellanic Cloud star clusters like NGC 1783.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out an extensive light curve comparison of BL Her stars using observations from Gaia DR3 and stellar pulsation models computed using MESA-RSP with the goal to obtain the best-matched modeled-observed pairs for BL Her stars in the LMC. We use the Fourier decomposition technique to analyse the light curves in the G band obtained from Gaia DR3 and from MESA-RSP and use a robust light curve fitting approach to score the modeled-observed pairs with respect to their pulsation periods and over their Fourier parameter space. We obtain the best-fit models for 48 BL Her stars in the LMC and thereby provide the stellar parameter estimates of these stars, 30 of which are labelled as the gold sample with superior light curve fits. We find a relatively flat distribution of stellar masses between 0.5-0.65 Msolar for the gold sample of modeled-observed pairs. An interesting result is that the majority of the best-matched models in the gold sample are computed using the convection parameter sets without radiative cooling. The period-Wesenheit relation for the best-matched gold sample of 30 BL Her models exhibits a slope of $-2.805 \pm 0.164$ while the corresponding period-radius relation exhibits a slope of $0.565 \pm 0.035$, both in good agreement with the empirical PW and PR slopes from BL Her stars in the LMC, respectively. We also used the Wesenheit magnitudes of the 30 best-matched modeled-observed pairs to estimate a distance modulus of $\mu_{\rm LMC} = 18.582 \pm 0.067$ to the LMC, which lies within the bounds of previous literature values. We also discuss the degeneracy in the stellar parameters of the BL Her models that result in similar pulsation periods and light curve structure, and highlight that caution must be exercised while using the stellar parameter estimates.
#### Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 I: the recent starburt and launch of outflow in simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 through high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve the star formation and feedback processes, avoiding the reliance on various assumed models as in previous works. We probe the effects of different stellar feedback mechanisms, the gas return from star-forming clouds and initial gas disc mass on the starburst and launch of outflow. Our simulations can generate a starburst that lasts 20-30 Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. However, the total stellar mass formed in the starburst in our simulations often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow's launch occurs in two stages. Initially, continuous SNe explosions form numerous small bubbles, merging into a super bubble foam composed of low-density warm/hot gas and high-density cool filaments. After approximately 10 Myr of SN energy injection, the super bubble breakout the disc, marking the second stage, which takes 10-15 Myr to develop a multiphase, kpc-scale outflow. Our simulations reveal that cool filaments within the turbulent ISM can survive from the feedback associated to the starburst, then were entrained into the outflow and stretched to hundreds pc in length due to interaction with the hot wind. While the mass loading factor of the well-developed outflow is comparable to M82, the cool gas mass outflow rate is often lower, and its velocity is slower than the estimated value in M82 by $50\%-60\%$. Warm and hot gas are $20\%-30\%$ slower. SN feedback acts as the primary driver of the outflow, while gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow properties. The initial mass of gas disc has a moderate effect, while stellar wind and radiation feedback have minor effect. To address the shortcomings in our results, enhanced SN feedback effect, due to clustered SNe, is likely necessary.
#### A universal and physically motivated threshold for Hessian-based cosmic web identification: V-Web case

 - **Abstract**
 The study of large-scale structure can benefit from accurate and robust identification of the cosmic web. Having such classification can facilitate a more complete extraction of cosmological information encoded therein. Classification methods like T-web and V-web, based on the Hessian matrix, are widely used to signal-out voids, sheets, filaments, and knots. However, these techniques depend on a threshold parameter which value is chosen without physical justification, usually relying on a user visual impression, thus limiting the universality of results. In this paper we focus on the V-web method. Our aim is to find a physical motivation for deriving an universal threshold that can be applied across different cosmic scales and epochs. V-web classify the large-scale structure using the eigenvalues of the velocity shear tensor. Using a set of gravity-only simulations we introduce a normalization that incorporates the standard deviation of the velocity divergence field, isolating the beyond Gaussian evolution of cosmic web elements. In the Zeldovich's approximation, the probability presence of each cosmic web element remains constant at a threshold equal to 0. For the first time, we reveal that this behavior also holds in the non-linear regime for a normalized positive 'constant volume threshold' that depends on both the redshift and the applied smoothing scale. The conservation of volume fractions is valid for the studied redshifts between 0 and 2, regardless of cosmic variance, and is most precise for intermediate smoothing scales around 3 Mpc/h. The properties of the cosmic web derived using this approach in the V-web align with expectations from other methods, including visual impressions. We provide a general fit formula to compute the constant volume threshold for any standard cosmological simulation, regardless of its specific properties.
