 - **Abstract**
 Small-sized exoplanets in tight orbits around young stars (10-1000 Myr) give us the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms that led to their formation, the evolution of their physical and orbital properties and, especially, of their atmospheres. Thanks to the all-sky survey carried out by TESS, many of these exoplanets have been discovered and have subsequently been characterized with dedicated follow-up observations. In the context of a collaboration among the GAPS, TKS and CPS teams, we measured with a high level of precision the mass and the radius of TOI-1430 b, a young (~700 Myr) exoplanet with an escaping He atmosphere orbiting the K-dwarf star HD 235088 (TOI-1430). By adopting appropriate stellar parameters, which were measured in this work, we were able to simultaneously model the signals due to strong stellar activity and the transiting planet TOI-1430 b in both photometric and spectroscopic series. This allowed us to measure the density of the planet with high precision, and reconstruct the evolution of its atmosphere. TOI-1430 is an active K-dwarf star born 700+/-150 Myr ago and rotates in ~12 d. It hosts a mini-Neptune whose orbital period is Pb=7.434133+/-0.000004 d. Thanks to long-term monitoring of this target performed with TESS, HARPS-N, HIRES, and APF, we estimated a radius Rb=1.98+/-0.07 $R_{\oplus}$, a mass Mb=4.2+/-0.8 $M_{\oplus}$, and thus a planetary density $\rho$b=0.5+/-0.1 $\rho_{\oplus}$. TOI-1430 b is hence a low-density mini-Neptune with an extended atmosphere, at the edge of the radius gap. Because this planet is known to have an evaporating atmosphere of He, we reconstructed its atmospheric history. Our analysis supports the scenario in which, shortly after its birth, TOI-1430 b may have been super-puffy, with a radius 5x-13x and a mass 1.5x-2x that of today; in ~200 Myr from now, TOI-1430 b should lose its envelope, showing its Earth-size core.
#### Mapping Galactic Dust Emission and Extinction with HI, HII, and H$_2$

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) emission closely traces the dust column density at high Galactic latitudes and is thus a powerful tool for predicting dust extinction. However, the relation between HI column density $N_{\rm HI}$ and high-latitude dust emission observed by Planck has large-scale residuals at the level of $\lesssim 20\%$ on tens of degree scales. In this work, we improve HI-based dust templates in the North/South Galactic poles covering a sky fraction of $f_{\rm sky}=13.5\%/11.0\%$ (5,577/4,555 deg$^2$) by incorporating data from ionized (HII) and molecular (H$_2$) gas phases. We make further improvements by employing a clustering analysis on the HI spectral data to identify discrete clouds with distinct dust properties. However, only a modest reduction in fitting residuals is achieved. We quantify the contributions to these residuals from variations in the dust-to-gas ratio, dust temperature and opacity, and magnetic field orientation using ancillary datasets. Although residuals in a few particular regions can be attributed to these factors, no single explanation accounts for the majority. We derive an upper limit on the high-latitude dust temperature variation of $\sigma_T<1.28$ K, lower than the temperature variation reported in previous studies. Joint analysis of multiple existing and upcoming datasets that trace Galactic gas and dust properties is needed to clarify the origins of the variation of gas and dust properties found here and to significantly improve gas-based extinction maps.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of supernova remnants (SNRs) in a two-phase cloudy medium by performing a series of high-resolution (up to $\Delta x\approx0.01\,\mathrm{pc}$), 3D hydrodynamical simulations including radiative cooling and thermal conduction. We aim to reach a resolution that directly captures the shock-cloud interactions for the majority of the clouds initialized by the saturation of thermal instability. In comparison to the SNR in a uniform medium with the volume filling warm medium, the SNR expands similarly (following $\propto t^{2/5}$) but sweeps up more mass as the cold clouds contribute before shocks in the warm medium become radiative. However, the SNR in a cloudy medium continuously loses energy after shocks toward the cold clouds cool, resulting in less hot gas mass, thermal energy, and terminal momentum. Thermal conduction has little effect on the dynamics of the SNR but smooths the morphology and modifies the internal structure by increasing the density of hot gas by a factor of $\sim 3-5$. The simulation results are not fully consistent with many previous 1D models describing the SNR in a cloudy medium including a mass loading term. By direct measurement in the simulations, we find that, apart from the mass source, the energy sink is also important with a spatially flat cooling rate $\dot{e}\propto t^{-11/5}$. As an illustration, we show an example 1D model including both mass source and energy sink terms (in addition to the radiative cooling in the volume filling component) that better describes the structure of the simulated SNR.

 - **Abstract**
 Shock-generated transients, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs), upstream of planetary bow shocks, play a critical role in electron acceleration. Using multi-mission data from NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and ESA's Cluster missions, we demonstrate the transmission of HFAs through Earth's quasi-parallel bow shock, associated with acceleration of electrons up to relativistic energies. Energetic electrons, initially accelerated upstream, are shown to remain broadly confined within the transmitted transient structures downstream, where betatron acceleration further boosts their energy due to elevated compression levels. Additionally, high-speed jets form at the compressive edges of HFAs, exhibiting a significant increase in dynamic pressure and potentially contributing to driving further localized compression. Our findings emphasize the efficiency of quasi-parallel shocks in driving particle acceleration far beyond the immediate shock transition region, expanding the acceleration region to a larger spatial domain. Finally, this study underscores the importance of multi-scale observational approach in understanding the convoluted processes behind collisionless shock physics and their broader implications.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on an international scientific conference, where we brought together the African and European academic astronomy communities. This conference aimed to bridge the gap between those in position of privilege, with ease of access to international networking events (i.e., the typical experience of those affiliated with Western institutions), with those who have been historically excluded (affecting the majority of African scientists/institutions). We describe how we designed the conference around cutting-edge problems in the research field, but with a large focus on building networking and professional relationships. Significant effort went into: (1) ensuring a diverse representation of participants; (2) practically and financially supporting those who may have never attended an international conference and; (3) creating an inclusive and supportive environment through a careful programme of activities, both before and during the event. Throughout this process maintaining scientific integrity was a core commitment. We summarise some of the successes, challenges, and lessons learnt from organising this conference. We also present feedback obtained from participants, which demonstrates an overall achievement of our objectives. This is all combined to provide some key recommendations for any groups, from any research field, who wishes to lead similar initiatives.

 About 15%-60% of all supernova remnants are estimated to interact with dense molecular this http URL these high density environments, radiative losses are this http URL cooling radiation can be observed in forbidden lines at optical this http URL aim to determine whether supernovae at different positions within a molecular cloud can be distinguished based on their optical emission, using machine this http URL have conducted a statistical analysis of the optical line emission of simulated supernovae interacting with molecular clouds that formed from the multi-phase interstellar medium modelled in the SILCC-Zoom simulations with and without magnetic fields. This work is based on the post-processing of 3-D (magneto)hydrodynamical this http URL data set consists of 22 simulations. The supernovae are placed at a distance of either 25 pc or 50 pc from the molecular cloud centre of mass. First, we calculate optical synthetic emission maps (taking into account dust attenuation within the simulation sub-cube). Second, we analyse the data set of synthetic observations using principle component analysis to identify clusters with the k-means algorithm. We find that the presence or absence of magnetic fields has no statistically significant effect on the optical line emission. However, the ambient density distribution at the site of the supernova changes the entire evolution and morphology of the supernova remnant. Due to the different ambient densities in the 25 pc and 50 pc simulations, we are able to distinguish them in a statistically significant manner. Although, optical line attenuation within the supernova remnant can mimic this result depending on the attenuation model that is used. That is why, multi-dimensional analysis of optical emission line ratios in this work does not give extra information about the environmental conditions (ambient density and ambient magnetic field) of the SNR.

 - **Abstract**
 The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer on the Mid-Infrared Instrument on JWST obtained spectra of three carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Two of the spectra differ significantly from spectra obtained ~16-19 years earlier with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The one semi-regular variable among the three has changed little. The long-period Mira variable in the sample shows changes consistent with its pulsation cycle. The short-period Mira shows dramatic changes in the strength of its molecular absorption bands, with some bands growing weaker and some stronger. Whether these variations result from its pulsation cycle or its evolution is not clear.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming regions host a large and evolving suite of molecular species. Molecular transition lines, particularly of complex molecules, can reveal the physical and dynamical environment of star formation. We aim to study the large-scale structure and environment of high-mass star formation through single-dish observations of CH$_3$CCH, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$CO. We have conducted a wide-band spectral survey with the IRAM 30-m telescope and the 100-m GBT towards the high-mass star-forming region DR21(OH)/N44. We use a multi-component local thermodynamic equilibrium model to determine the large-scale physical environment near DR21(OH) and the surrounding dense clumps. We follow up with a radiative transfer code for CH$_3$OH to look at non-LTE behaviour. We then use a gas-grain chemical model to understand the formation routes of these molecules in their observed environments. We disentangle multiple components of DR21(OH) in each of the three molecules. We find a warm and cold component each towards the dusty condensations MM1 and MM2, and a fifth broad, outflow component. We also reveal warm and cold components towards other dense clumps in our maps: N40, N36, N41, N38, and N48. We find thermal mechanisms are adequate to produce the observed abundances of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$CCH while non-thermal mechanisms are needed to produce CH$_3$OH. Through a combination of wide-band mapping observations, LTE and non-LTE model analysis, and chemical modelling, we disentangle the different velocity and temperature components within our clump-scale beam, a scale that links a star-forming core to its parent cloud. We find numerous warm, 20-80 K components corresponding to known cores and outflows in the region. We determine the production routes of these species to be dominated by grain chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The magnetic dynamo mechanism of giant stars remains an open question, which can be explored by investigating their activity-rotation relations with multiple proxies. By using the data from the LAMOST and \emph{GALEX} surveys, we carried out a comprehensive study of activity-rotation relations of evolved stars based on \cahk lines, $\rm{H\alpha}$ lines and near ultraviolet (NUV) emissions. Our results show that evolved stars and dwarfs obey a similar power-law in the unsaturated region of the activity-rotation relation, indicating a common dynamo mechanism in both giant and dwarfs. There is no clear difference in the activity levels between red giant branch stars and red clump stars, nor between single giants and those in binaries. Additionally, our results show that the NUV activity levels of giants are comparable to those of G- and K-type dwarfs and are higher than those of M dwarfs.
#### SDSS J102915.14+172927.9: Revisiting the chemical pattern

 - **Abstract**
 Context: The small- to intermediate-mass ($M <0.8 M_\odot$), most metal-poor stars that formed in the infancy of the Universe are still shining today in the sky. They are very rare, but their discovery and investigation brings new knowledge on the formation of the first stellar generations. Aims: SDSS J102915.14+172927.9 is one of the most metal-poor star known to date. Since no carbon can be detected in its spectrum, a careful upper limit is important, both to classify this star and to distinguish it from the carbon-enhanced stars that represent the majority at these metallicities. Methods: We undertook a new observational campaign to acquire high-resolution UVES spectra. The new spectra were combined with archival spectra in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. From the combined spectrum, we derived abundances for seven elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, and a tentative Li) and five significant upper limits (C, Na, Al, Sr, and Ba). Results: The star has a carbon abundance A(C) <4.68 and therefore is not enhanced in carbon, at variance with the majority of the stars at this Fe regime, which typically show A(C)> 6.0. A feature compatible with the Li doublet at 670.7 nm is tentatively detected. Conclusions: The upper limit on carbon implies $Z<1.915 \times 10^{-6}$, more than 20 times lower than the most iron-poor star known. Therefore, the gas cloud out of which the star was formed did not cool via atomic lines but probably through dust. Fragmentation of the primordial cloud is another possibility for the formation of a star with a metallicity this low.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the vast gap between photometric and spectroscopic data volumes, there is great potential in using 5D kinematic information to identify and study substructures of the Milky Way. We identify substructures in the Galactic halo using 46,575 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) from Gaia DR3 with the photometric metallicities and distances newly estimated by Li et al. (2023). Assuming a Gaussian prior distribution of radial velocity, we calculate the orbital distribution characterized by the integrals of motion for each RRL based on its 3D positions, proper motions and corresponding errors, and then apply the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify groups moving along similar orbits. We have identified several known substructures, including Sagittarius (Sgr) Stream, Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC), Virgo Overdensity (VOD), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Orphan-Chenab stream, Cetus-Palca, Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Wukong and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) leading arm, along with 18 unknown groups. Our findings indicate that HAC and VOD have kinematic and chemical properties remarkably similar to GES, with most HAC and VOD members exhibiting eccentricity as high as GES, suggesting that they may share a common origin with GES. The ability to identify the low mass and spatially dispersed substructures further demonstrates the potential of our method, which breaks the limit of spectroscopic survey and is competent to probe the substructures in the whole Galaxy. Finally, we have also identified 18 unknown groups with good spatial clustering and proper motion consistency, suggesting more excavation of Milky Way substructures in the future with only 5D data.
