 - **Abstract**
 The recent tension in the value of the cosmological parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_M/0.3)^{1/2}$, which represents the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations of the universe, has not been resolved. In this work, we present constraints on $S_8$ with the X-ray angular power spectra of clusters and groups measured with the half-sky map from the eROSITA All Sky Survey data release 1 (eRASS1). Thanks to the extensive sky coverage of eRASS1, its power spectrum achieves unprecedented precision compared to previous measurements. Using a well-calibrated, physical halo gas model that includes astrophysics of feedback and non-thermal pressure support, we obtain $S_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ with 1$\sigma$ uncertainty that is competitive against other cosmological probes. Our derived $S_8$ value is smaller than the primary CMB measurements from Planck, but still consistent to within $1\sigma$. We also obtain constraints on the astrophysics of feedback, non-thermal pressure, equation of state in cluster cores, and gas boundaries in clusters and groups. We discuss how additional X-ray observations, and cosmological surveys in microwave and optical, will further improve the cosmological constraints with the angular power spectrum. Our work demonstrates that the angular power spectrum of clusters and groups is a promising probe of both cosmology and astrophysics.
#### Retrievals on NIRCam transmission and emission spectra of HD 189733b with PLATON 6, a GPU code for the JWST era

 - **Abstract**
 We present the 2.4--5.0 \um JWST/NIRCam emission spectrum of HD 189733b, along with an independent re-reduction of the previously published transmission spectrum at the same wavelengths. We use an upgraded version of PLanetary Atmospheric Tool for Observer Noobs (PLATON) to retrieve atmospheric parameters from both geometries. In transit, we obtain [M/H]=$0.53_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$ and C/O=$0.41_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$, assuming a power-law haze and equilibrium chemistry with methane depletion. In eclipse, we obtain [M/H]=$0.68_{-0.11}^{+0.15}$ and C/O=$0.43_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$, assuming a clear atmosphere and equilibrium chemistry without methane depletion. These results are consistent with each other, and with a re-run of our previously published joint retrieval of HST and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra. Accounting for methane depletion decreases the C/O ratio by 0.14/0.04 (transmission/emission), but changing the limb cloud parameterization does not affect the C/O ratio by more than 0.06. We detect H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$S in both the NIRCam transmission and emission spectra, find that methane is depleted on the terminator, and confirm with VULCAN that photochemistry is a potential cause of this depletion. We also find tentative (1.8$\sigma$) evidence of a dayside thermal inversion at millibar pressures. Finally, we take this opportunity to introduce a new version of PLATON. PLATON 6 supports GPU computation, speeding up the code up to 10x. It also supports free retrievals using both volume mixing ratio and centered-log ratio priors; emission from planetary surfaces of different compositions; updated opacities at improved resolution; and Pareto smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross validation (PSIS-LOO).
#### Fast Transients from Magnetic Disks Around Non-Spinning Collapsar Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 Most black holes (BHs) formed in collapsing stars have low spin, though some are expected to acquire a magnetic accretion disk during the collapse. While such BH disks can launch magnetically driven winds, their physics and observational signatures have remained unexplored. We present global 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars that form slowly spinning BHs with accretion disks. As the disk transitions to a magnetically arrested state, it drives mildly relativistic, wobbling, collimated magnetic outflows through two mechanisms: steady outflows along vertical magnetic field lines (''Blandford-Payne jets'') and magnetic flux eruptions. With an isotropic-equivalent energy of $E_{\rm iso}\approx10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$, exceeding that of relativistic jets from BHs with spin $a\lesssim 0.25$, the disk outflows unbind the star, ultimately capping the final BH mass at $ M_{\rm BH} \approx 4\,M_\odot$. Once the outflows emerge from the star, they produce mildly relativistic shock breakout, cooling, and $^{56}{\rm Ni}$-decay emission. Our cooling emission estimates suggest a bright near-ultraviolet and optical signal at absolute magnitude $M_{\rm AB}\approx-16$ lasting for several days. This indicates that disk winds could be responsible for the first peak in the double-peaked light curves observed in Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe) or power another class of transients. The detection rate in the upcoming Rubin Observatory and ULTRASAT/UVEX will enable us to differentiate between competing models for the origin of the first SN peak and provide constraints on the physics and formation rate of accretion disks in core-collapse SNe.
#### Stellar Expansion or Inflation?

 - **Abstract**
 While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.

 - **Abstract**
 The outskirts of the Milky Way disc have been known to be warped since the late 1950s. Although various stellar populations have shown an underlying warped distribution, the relation between the age of the population and the warp they trace remains an open question. Our goal in this work is to detect the presence of the warp in the RR Lyrae (RRL) population of the Galactic disc. We use a compilation of public catalogues of RRL stars, precise photometric distances ($\sim 5\%$) and Gaia DR3 proper motions to kinematically select a sample of thin disc RRL in the Galactic anticentre, where the tangential velocity best approximates the azimuthal velocity to differentiate between disc and halo. For disc-like RRL we analyse their mean vertical height and mean vertical velocity. We show, for the first time, that RRL stars with thin disc-like kinematics trace the warp. In the anticentre direction, the RRL population reaches a minimum in mean vertical height of $\approx 0.4$ kpc, with a trend systematically lower than the one found with Classical Cepheids. The kinematical signal of the RRL warp starts at $R\approx 10$ kpc and, rather than resembling the Cepheid's, shows a similar trend to the Red Clump population from previous works, reaching a maximum value of $\approx 7$ km/s in vertical velocity. We also obtain an estimation of the pattern speed of the RRL warp with a prograde rotation of $\approx 13 \pm 2 $ km/s/kpc, compatible with results obtained from Cepheids. Finally, we obtain a vertical velocity dispersion $\approx 17 $km/s, inconsistent with the kinematics of a canonical old age ($> 10$ Gyr) disc population and, instead, favouring a population dominated by intermediate-age ($3-4$ Gyr). Our results indicate that the thin disc RRL stars are a dynamical intermediate-age tracer of the warp, opening a new window to study the dependency of the warp with stellar age.
#### First results from the JWST Early Release Science Program Q3D: AGN photoionization and shock4 ionization in a red quasar at z = 0.45

 - **Abstract**
 Red quasars, often associated with potent [OIII] outflows on both galactic and circumgalactic scales, may play a pivotal role in galactic evolution and black hole feedback. In this work, we explore the [FeII] emission in one such quasar at redshift z = 0.4352, F2M J110648.32+480712.3, using the integral field unit (IFU) mode of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our observations reveal clumpy [FeII] gas located to the south of the quasar. By comparing the kinematics of [FeII] and [OIII], we find that the clumpy [FeII] gas in the southeast and southwest aligns with the outflow, exhibiting similar median velocities up to v_50 ~ 1200 km/s and high velocity widths W_80 > 1000 km/s. In contrast, the [FeII] gas to the south shows kinematics inconsistent with the outflow, with W_80 ~ 500 km/s, significantly smaller than the [OIII] at the same location, suggesting that the [FeII] may be confined within the host galaxy. Utilizing standard emission-line diagnostic ratios, we map the ionization sources of the gas. According to the MAPPINGS III shock models for [FeII]/Pabeta, the regions to the southwest and southeast of the quasar are primarily photoionized. Conversely, the [FeII] emission to the south is likely excited by shocks generated by the back-pressure of the outflow on the galaxy disk, a direct signature of the impact of the quasar on its host.
#### The Dust Extinction Curve: Beyond R(V)

 - **Abstract**
 The dust extinction curve is typically parameterized by a single variable, R(V), in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. R(V) controls the slope of the extinction-vs.-wavelength curve, and is thought to reflect the grain-size distribution and composition of dust. Low-resolution, flux-calibrated BP/RP spectra from Gaia have allowed the determination of the extinction curve along sightlines to 130 million stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We show that these extinction curves contain more than a single degree of freedom - that is, that they are not simply described by R(V). We identify a number of components that are orthogonal to R(V) variation, and show that these components vary across the sky in coherent patterns that resemble interstellar medium structure. These components encode variation in the 770 nm extinction feature, intermediate-scale and very broad structure, and a newly identified feature at 850 nm, and likely trace both dust composition and local conditions in the interstellar medium. Correlations of the 770 nm and 850 nm features with R(V) suggest that their carriers become more abundant as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom feature is destroyed. Our 24 million extinction-curve decompositions and feature equivalent-width measurements are publicly available at this https URL.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova shocks into dense molecular cores in IC 443 (clumps B, C, and G) and 3C 391 were observed using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and complemented by archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory. The pure rotational transitions 0-0 S(1) and S(5) of H2, and the ground-state 110-101 transition of H2O, are all broadened, arising from molecules that survive the passage of the shock front. Theoretical models from the Paris-Durham shock code were analyzed to generate synthetic profiles that approximately match the observations. The observations can be fit with two shock conditions, which approximate the range of densities in the pre-shock molecular cloud. The width and brightness of the S(5) lines require shocks into gas with a density of order 2,000 cm-3, into which the IC 443 blast wave drives shocks with speed 60 km/s. The brightness and narrower width of the S(1) lines requires different shocks, into gas with density of order 10^5 cm-3, with shock speeds of 10 km/s. The H2O velocity distribution is also consistent with these shocks. The existence of shocks into dense gas shows that the bright shocked clumps in IC~443 were prestellar cores. It is unlikely that they will form stars soon after the passage of the shock front, given the input of kinetic and thermal energy from the shocks.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we carry out multiwavelength and multiview observations of the prominence eruption, which generates a C2.3 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2023 March 7. For the first time, we apply the revised cone model to three-dimension reconstruction and tracking of the eruptive prominence for ~4 hrs. The prominence propagates non-radially and makes a detour around the large-scale coronal loops in active region NOAA 13243. The northward deflection angle increases from ~36 degrees to ~47 degrees before returning to ~36 degrees and keeping up. There is no longitudinal deflection throughout the propagation. The angular width of the cone increases from ~30 degrees and reaches a plateau at ~37 degrees. The heliocentric distance of the prominence rises from ~1.1 to ~10.0 solar radii, and the prominence experiences continuous acceleration (~51 m/s^2) over two hours, which is probably related to the magnetic reconnection during the C-class flare. The true speed of CME front is estimated to be ~829 km/s, which is ~1.2 times larger than that of CME core (prominence). It is concluded that both acceleration and deflection of eruptive prominences in their early lives could be reproduced with the revised cone model.

 - **Abstract**
 Large gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events can pose a radiation risk to crewed spaceflight and a significant threat to near-Earth satellites however, the origin of the SEP seed particle population, how these particles are released, accelerated and transported into the heliosphere are not well understood. We analyse NOAA active region (AR) 12673, that was the source responsible for multiple large gradual SEP events during September 2017, and found that almost immediately after each significant eruptive event associated with SEPs an enhanced Si/S abundance ratio was measured by Wind, consistent with the previous work by Brooks et al. Hinode/EIS took data roughly 8~hours before the second SEP event on 2017 September 6 that allowed the regions of enhanced Si/S abundance ratio in the AR to be determined. We have shown that the AR contains plasma with elemental abundance values detected in situ by Wind. In particular, the plasma originates from the core of the AR, similar to Brooks et al., but in the moss (footpoints) associated with hot sigmoidal AR loops. The sigmoid, that contains highly fractionated plasma, erupts and propagates towards an Earth-connected magnetic null point, providing a direct channel for the highly fractionated plasma to escape and be detected in the near-Earth environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying stars belonging to different classes is vital in order to build up statistical samples of different phases and pathways of stellar evolution. In the era of surveys covering billions of stars, an automated method of identifying these classes becomes necessary. Many classes of stars are identified based on their emitted spectra. In this paper, we use a combination of the multi-class multi-label Machine Learning (ML) method XGBoost and the PySSED spectral-energy-distribution fitting algorithm to classify stars into nine different classes, based on their photometric data. The classifier is trained on subsets of the SIMBAD database. Particular challenges are the very high sparsity (large fraction of missing values) of the underlying data as well as the high class imbalance. We discuss the different variables available, such as photometric measurements on the one hand, and indirect predictors such as Galactic position on the other hand. We show the difference in performance when excluding certain variables, and discuss in which contexts which of the variables should be used. Finally, we show that increasing the number of samples of a particular type of star significantly increases the performance of the model for that particular type, while having little to no impact on other types. The accuracy of the main classifier is ~0.7 with a macro F1 score of 0.61. While the current accuracy of the classifier is not high enough to be reliably used in stellar classification, this work is an initial proof of feasibility for using ML to classify stars based on photometry.
#### A multi-faceted view of the X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert galaxy Ark 120

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing a range of techniques including multi-band light curves, softness ratio analysis, structure functions, rms spectra, cross-correlation functions, and ratios of spectra from different intervals, we present a comprehensive study of the complex X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, through re-analyzing its six XMM-Newton observations taken between 2003 and 2014. We find a clear ''softer-when-brighter" trend in the 2--10 keV power-law component over long timescales, with this trend being timescale dependent, as it is much weaker on shorter timescales, similar to that previously detected in NGC 4051. Notably, a rare ''harder-when-brighter" trend is observed during one exposure, indicating dynamic changes in the spectral variability behavior of the power-law component. This exceptional exposure, with the spectral variability indeed marked by a power-law pivoting at an unusually low energy of ~ 2 keV, suggests intricate variations in the thermal Comptonization processes within the corona. Furthermore, when the data below 2 keV are included, we identify that the soft excess component adds significant complexity to the spectral variability, such as evidenced by a transition from ''harder-when-brighter'' to ''softer-when-brighter'' during another single exposure. Such extra complexity arises because the variability of the soft excess sometimes follows and sometimes does not follow the changes in the power-law component. Our findings underscore the necessity of applying multiple analytic techniques to fully capture the multifaceted spectral variability of AGNs.
#### Dust extinction-curve variation in the translucent interstellar medium is driven by PAH growth

 - **Abstract**
 The first all-sky, high-resolution, 3D map of the optical extinction curve of the Milky Way (Zhang & Green 2024) revealed an unexpected steepening of the extinction curve in the moderate-density, "translucent" interstellar medium (ISM). We argue that this trend is driven by growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through gas-phase accretion. We find a strong anti-correlation between the slope of the optical extinction curve -- parameterized by $R(V)$ -- and maps of PAH abundance -- parameterized by $q_{\rm PAH}$ -- derived from infrared emission. The range of observed $q_{\rm PAH}$ indicates PAH growth by a factor of $\sim$2 between $A_V \simeq 1$ and 3. This implies a factor-of-two stronger 2175 Angstrom feature, which is sufficient to lower $R(V)$ by the observed amount. This level of PAH growth is possible given rapid accretion timescales and the depletion of carbon in the translucent ISM. Spectral observations by JWST would provide a definitive test of this proposed explanation of $R(V)$ variation.

 - **Abstract**
 Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is a prominent mechanism for energizing charged particles up to very large rigidities at astrophysical collisionless shocks. In addition to ions and electrons, it has been proposed that interstellar dust grains could also be accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration, for instance, at supernova remnants (SNRs). Considering interstellar dust grains of various size and composition, we investigate the possibility of grain acceleration at young SNR shocks (throughout the free expansion and Sedov-Taylor phases) and the maximum energies reached by the accelerated grains. We investigate the potential implications on the abundance of refractory species relative to volatile elements in the cosmic-ray composition. We rely on semi-analytical descriptions of particle acceleration at strong shocks, and on self-similar solutions for the dynamics of SNR shock waves. For simplicity, type Ia thermonuclear SNRs expanding in uniform interstellar medium are considered. We find that the acceleration of dust grains at relativistic speed is possible, up to Lorentz factor of $\sim 10^{2}$, kinetic energy $E_{\rm k}/\text{nuc}\sim 10^2$ GeV/nuc for the smaller grains of size $a\sim 5 \times 10^{-7}$ cm. We find that the subsequent sputtering of grains can produce nuclei with a rigidity sufficient to be injected in the process of diffusive shock acceleration. Such scenario can help naturally account for the overabundance of refractory elements in the Galactic cosmic-ray composition, provided that a fraction $\eta \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ of dust grains swept up by a SNR are energized through DSA.

 Knowledge of the composition of material that will form planets is crucial to understand planetary diversity and the occurrence of potentially habitable planets. Ultimately, it is the chemistry in circumstellar disks that determines the global make up of planetary systems, as the dust in these disks grows into giant planet cores and rocky planets, the gas becomes incorporated in giant planet atmospheres, and the ices can be delivered to rocky planets by comets and meteorites. With the advent of ALMA a decade ago and the recent launch of JWST, the composition of the disk gas and ice can now be studied in great detail. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of the disk chemical structure, focusing on the six elements essential to life on Earth: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).
