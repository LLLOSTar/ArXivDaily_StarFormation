#### Probing the Kinematics of Multiple- and Single-Protostar Systems in Perseus with N2H+

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the dense gas kinematics in two Class 0/I protostellar cores, Per 30 and NGC 1333 IRAS 7, in the Perseus molecular cloud to determine whether their velocity structures are indicative of rotation. We examine the hyperfine structure of the N2H+ J=1-0 transition by combining 3" (900 AU) Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) measurements with 9" (2700 AU) measurements from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We use the CASA Feather method to combine these data in order to maximize our sensitivity across spatial scales. We fit the N2H+ spectra to constrain the centroid velocity of the gas at each pixel and use these values to calculate the linear velocity gradient and specific angular momentum within apertures centered on each protostar with radii ranging from 5-60". Our results indicate that the velocity structure probed by the N2H+ emission is likely not a result of core rotation. These findings are consistent with other studies in the literature which indicate rotation is often not evident on scales less than 1000 AU. We instead suggest that the velocity structure we see is a result of torques caused by irregular density distributions in these protostellar systems.
#### Ice sublimation in the dynamic HD 100453 disk reveals a rich reservoir of inherited complex organics

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks around luminous young A-type stars are prime observational laboratories to determine the abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) present during planet formation. In contrast to their lower stellar mass counterparts, these warmer disks contain the sublimation fronts of complex molecules such as CH3OH on spatial scales accessible with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We present ALMA observations of the Herbig Ae disk HD 100453 that uncover a rich reservoir of COMs sublimating from the dust cavity edge. In addition to CH3OH, we detect 13CH3OH for the first time in a Class II disk, revealing a factor of three enhancement of 13C in the disk large organics. A tentative detection of CH2DOH is also reported, resulting in a D/H of 1-2%, which is consistent with the expected deuterium enhancement from the low temperature CH3OH formation in molecular clouds and with the deuteration of CH3OH measured in comets. The detection of methyl-formate (CH3OCHO), at only a few percent level of CH3OH is an order of magnitude lower compared to claims towards other organic-rich Herbig Ae disks but is more in line with organic abundance patterns towards the earlier stages of star formation. Together these data provide multiple lines of evidence that disks, and therefore the planet and comet-forming materials, contain inherited interstellar ices and perhaps the strongest evidence to date that much of the interstellar organic ice composition survives the early stages of planet formation.
#### Out on a Limb: The Signatures of East-West Asymmetries in Transmission Spectra from General Circulation Models

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of JWST, observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres are becoming increasingly precise. As a result, the signature of limb asymmetries due to temperature or abundance differences and the presence of aerosols can now be directly measured using transmission spectroscopy. Using a grid of general circulation models (GCMs) with varying irradiation temperature (1500 K - 4000 K) and prescriptions of cloud formation, we simulate 3D ingress/egress and morning/evening-limb transmission spectra. We aim to assess the impact that clouds, 3D temperature structure, and non-uniform distribution of gases have on the observed spectra, and how these inhomogeneities can be identified. A second goal is to assess the relative merits of two separate methods (ingress/egress v.s. morning/evening-limb spectroscopy) for isolating atmospheric asymmetries. From our models, it is evident that an east-west temperature difference is the leading order effect for producing ingress/egress or morning/evening-limb spectral differences. We additionally find that clouds contribute strongly to the observed limb asymmetry at moderate irradiation temperatures in our grid ($\sim 2000 \mathrm{K} < T_{\mathrm{irr}} < 3500 \mathrm{K}). At lower temperatures clouds equally dominate the optical depth on both limbs, while at higher temperatures the entire terminator region remains cloud-free. We develop limb asymmetry metrics that can be used to assess the degree of east-west asymmetry for a given planet and predict trends in these metrics with respect to irradiation temperature that are indicative of various physical processes. Our results are useful for predicting and diagnosing the signatures of limb asymmetries in JWST spectra.
#### The Ophiuchus DIsk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA): A Unified Evolutionary Sequence of Planet-Driven Substructures Explaining the Diversity of Disk Morphologies

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the origin of substructures in protoplanetary disks and their connection to planet formation is currently one of the main challenges in astrophysics. While some disks appear smooth, most exhibit diverse substructures such as gaps, rings, or inner cavities, with varying brightness and depth. As part of the Ophiuchus Disk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA), we previously proposed an evolutionary sequence to unify this diversity, driven by the formation of giant planets through core accretion and subsequent planet-disk interactions. By combining the disk evolution and planet formation code PLANETALP with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, we have now reproduced the key aspects of the proposed evolutionary sequence. Starting with a smooth disk (like e.g., WLY 2-63), we modeled the evolution of a fiducial disk with a 1 Jupiter-mass planet at 57 au. Within a few hundreds of orbits, a narrow gap forms, resembling ISO-Oph 17. By $\sim$0.1 Myr, the gap widens, and dust accumulates at the cavity edge, producing a structure similar to Elias 2-24. At $\sim$0.4 Myr, the disk evolves further into a morphology akin to DoAr 44, characterized by a smaller inner disk and a brighter inner rim. By $\sim$1 Myr, the system transitions to a single narrow ring, resembling RXJ1633.9-2442. This line of work strongly supports the planetary origin of substructures and enables the possibility of identifying a population of planets that is currently beyond the reach of more direct detection techniques.
#### Red Supergiant problem viewed from the nebular phase spectroscopy of type II supernovae
 - **Authors:** Qiliang Fang, Takashi J. Moriya, Keiichi Maeda

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14502

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14502

 - **Abstract**
 The red supergiant (RSG) problem refers to the observed dearth of luminous RSGs identified as progenitors of Type II supernovae (SNe II) in pre-SN imaging. Understanding this phenomenon is essential for studying pre-SN mass loss and the explodability of core-collapse SNe. In this work, we re-assess the RSG problem using late-phase spectroscopy of a sample of 50 SNe II. The [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300,6363 emission in the spectra is employed to infer the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass distribution of the progenitors, which is then transformed into a luminosity distribution via an observation-calibrated mass-luminosity relation. The resulting luminosity distribution reveals an upper cutoff at log $L/L_{\odot} = 5.21^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ dex, and the RSG problem is statistically significant at the 2$\sigma$ to 3$\sigma$ level. Assuming single RSG progenitors that follow the mass-luminosity relation of KEPLER models, this luminosity cutoff corresponds to an upper ZAMS mass limit of $20.63^{+2.42}_{-1.64}$ $M_{\odot}$. Comparisons with independent measurements, including pre-SN imaging and plateau-phase light curve modeling, consistently yield an upper ZAMS mass limit below about 25 $M_{\odot}$, with a significance level of 1-3$\sigma$. While each individual method provides only marginal significance, the consistency across multiple methodologies suggests that the lack of luminous RSG progenitors may reflect a genuine physical problem. Finally, we discuss several scenarios to account for this issue should it be confirmed as a true manifestation of stellar physics.
#### Initiation Route of Coronal Mass Ejections: II. The Role of Filament Mass
 - **Authors:** Chen Xing, Xin Cheng, Guillaume Aulanier, Mingde Ding

 - **Abstract**
 The thorough understanding on the initiation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which is manifested as a slow rise of pre-eruptive structures before the impulsive ejection in kinematics, is the key for forecasting the solar eruptions. In our previous work, we showed that the slow rise of a hot flux rope with coronal mass density is caused by the moderate magnetic reconnection occurring in the hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) combined with the torus instability. However, it remains unclear how the initiation process varies when a filament is present in the pre-eruptive flux rope. In this work, we reveal the complete initiation route of a CME containing filament mass with a state-of-the-art full-magnetohydrodynamics simulation. The comprehensive analyses show that the filament mass has an important impact on the CME initiation through triggering and driving the slow rise of flux rope with its drainage, besides the contributions of HFT reconnection and torus instability. Finally, in combination with our previous work, we propose that the enhanced drainage of filament mass and various features related to the HFT reconnection, such as, the split of pre-eruptive structure and the pre-flare loops and X-ray emissions, can serve as the precursors of CME initiation in observations.
#### Cloud-cloud collision and star formation in G013.313+0.193

 - **Abstract**
 We study the G013.313+0.193 G013.313 region, a complex environment characterized by molecular cloud interactions indicative of cloud-cloud collision (CCC). Observations of the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions were obtained using the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, while HCO+ (1-0), 12CO, 13CO, and C18O(1-0) transitions from the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 14 m telescope. Archival data are also included. We identified key observational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions, U-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The position-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction between two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an estimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated collision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of collision-induced star formation. Hub-filament system (HFS) are identified in the compressed gas region, where filaments converge toward a dense hub, suggesting the CCC as a potential driver of HFS formation and massive star formation. The high column density suggests favorable conditions for the formation of massive stars. Although alternative kinematic drivers such as longitudinal collapse and shear motion are considered, CCC remains the most plausible explanation for the observed features. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cloud dynamics and massive star formation in turbulent molecular environments.
#### A New Formation Mechanism of Counterstreaming Mass Flows in Filaments and the Doppler Bullseye Pattern in Prominences

 - **Abstract**
 The eruption of solar prominences can eject substantial mass and magnetic field into interplanetary space and cause geomagnetic storms. However, various questions about prominences and their eruption mechanism remain unclear. In particular, what causes the intriguing Doppler bullseye pattern in prominences has not yet been solved, despite some preliminary studies proposing that they are probably associated with counterstreaming mass flows. Previous studies are mainly based on single-angle and short timescale observations, making it difficult to determine the physical origin of Doppler bullseye patterns in prominences. Here, taking advantage of stereoscopic observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory and a three-dimensional numerical simulation, we investigate the origin of prominence Doppler bullseye pattern by tracing a long-lived transequatorial filament/prominence from July 23 to August 4, 2012. We find that repeated coronal jets at one end of the prominence can launch the Doppler bullseye pattern. It is evidenced in our observations and simulation that during the forward traveling of jet plasma along the helical magnetic field structure of the prominence, part of the ejecting plasma can not pass through the apex of the prominence due to the insufficient kinetic energy and therefore forms a backward-moving mass flow along the same or neighboring magnetic field lines. This process finally forms counterstreaming mass flows in on-disk filaments. When the on-disk filament rotates to the solar limb to be a prominence, the counterstreaming mass flows are naturally observed as a Doppler bullseye pattern.

 - **Abstract**
 Filaments are special plasma phenomena embedded in the solar atmosphere, characterized by unique thermodynamic properties and magnetic structures. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are useful to investigate the eruption mechanisms of filaments. We conduct a data-constrained zero-$\beta$ MHD simulation in spherical coordinates to investigate a C3.5 class flare triggered by an eruptive filament on 2022 August 15 in a decaying weak active region 13079. We reconstruct the three-dimensional coronal magnetic field using vector magnetograms and synoptic maps from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI). We transform vector magnetic field into Stonyhurst heliographic spherical coordinates combined with a synoptic map and constructed a potential field source surface (PFSS) model with a magnetic flux rope (MFR) embedded using the Regularized Biot--Savart Laws (RBSL). Subsequently, we conduct a spherical zero-$\beta$ MHD simulation using the Message Passing Interface Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) and replicated the entire dynamic process of the filament eruption consistent with observations. With the calculation of time-distance profile, Qusai-Separatrix Layers (QSL), and synthetic radiation from simulated current density, we find a good agreement between our simulation and observations in terms of dynamics and magnetic topology. Technically, we provide a useful method of advanced data-constrained simulation of weak active regions in spherical coordinates. Scientifically, the model allows us to quantitatively describe and diagnose the entire process of filament eruption.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Its success, however, critically depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. In this work, we investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRLQs for future 21-cm forest studies. Building upon a previously developed quasar luminosity function (QLF), we forecast HzRLQ abundances under various array configurations. Assuming a total survey area of $10^4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and 1 year of observation, we compare continuum surveys with 10 MHz bandwidth and 21-cm forest surveys with 5 kHz resolution. Our results show that a minimum collecting area of $\sim$6 500 m$^2$ enables detection at $z \sim 6$, while SKA-like arrays ($N_{\mathrm{st}} = 512$) extend the detection limit to $z \sim 10$ for 21-cm forest survey and $z \sim 16$ for continuum survey. Larger arrays with $N_{\mathrm{st}} = 2048$ can reach $z \sim 11$ in 21-cm forest mode. We also explore configurations that maintain fixed collecting areas while increasing the number to enhance survey efficiency. This boosts source detection but significantly increases the data volume and computational demands. These results underscore the importance of optimizing array design for different survey goals and balancing sensitivity, spectral resolution, and data management. A well-designed Moon-based array could open a new observational window on reionization and early cosmic structure formation.
#### Multiwavelength Observations of the Precursors Before the Eruptive X4.9 Limb Solar Flare on 25 February, 2014: Current Sheet, Eruptive Filament, Flare and Eruption Onset in the Frame of the Tether-Cutting Magnetic Reconnection Scenario

 - **Abstract**
 We present multiwavelength analysis of the pre-flare phase and onset of the powerful X4.9 near-limb eruptive solar flare on February 25, 2014, revealing the tether-cutting (TC) geometry. We aim at determining relationship between the region of pre-flare energy release with the regions where the flare started to develop, and to investigate a detailed chronology of energy release during the pre-flare time interval and the beginning of the impulse phase. Using X-ray, ultraviolet and radio microwave data we found that the pre-flare energy release site was compact and localized in the vicinity of TC interaction of magnetic structures near the polarity inversion line. The analysis indicates that a pre-flare current sheet (CS) could be in this region. Good correspondence between the location of the pre-flare and flare emission sources visible at the very beginning of the impulsive phase is shown. We found relationship between dynamics of the energy release in the pre-flare CS and formation of the future flare eruptive structure. The growth of the magnetic flux rope was associated with activation of plasma emissions, flows and an increase of UV radiation fluxes from the region where the pre-flare CS was located. The eruptive flux rope gradually grew due to feeding by magnetized plasma ejected from the reconnecting pre-flare CS. Finally, it is shown that the most probable trigger of the eruption was a local fast microflare-like magnetic reconnection in the pre-flare CS. Some local instability in the pre-flare sheet could lead to a transition from the slow to fast reconnection regime. As a result, an ejection from the sheet was initiated and the eruptive flux rope lost its stability. Then, the eruptive flux rope itself initiated formation of the main reconnecting flare CS as in the Standard Flare Model during its movement, and intense emissions associated with the impulsive phase were observed.
#### Coronal Gas in Magellanic-Analog Dwarfs: Insights from the \textsc{HESTIA} Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the warm circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a dwarf galaxy pair with properties similar to the Magellanic Clouds in the \textsc{Hestia} cosmological simulations. The system consists of a massive dwarf ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$) and a lower-mass companion ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$), dynamically evolving in isolation before infall into a Milky Way-mass halo. The massive dwarf hosts a warm coronal gas envelope with a temperature of $T \sim 3 \times 10^5$ K, consistent with expectations for virialized CGM in dwarf halos. Tidal interactions produce a neutral gas stream that extends over $\sim 150$ kpc, with an \ion{H}{1} mass of $M_{\rm HI} \sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$, similar to the Magellanic Stream. Furthermore, in the \textsc{Hestia} simulation suite, we find that coronal gas is ubiquitous in all halos with $M_{\rm halo} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, implying that massive dwarfs generically develop extended gaseous envelopes prior to accretion. This result has significant implications for the survival of neutral tidal structures, and suggests that current and future high-ion UV absorption-line observations are indicative of warm coronae surrounding LMC-mass dwarfs, independent of their environment.
