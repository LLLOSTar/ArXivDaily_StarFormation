#### Chemistry and ro-vibrational excitation of HeH$^+$ in the Planetary Nebula NGC 7027

 - **Abstract**
 HeH$^+$ belongs to the class of "reactive" ions that can be destroyed so quickly that chemical formation and destruction rates may compete with inelastic rates and should be considered when solving the statistical equilibrium equations. This so-called chemical "pumping" or "excitation" effect is investigated here for the first time in HeH$^+$. The chemical evolution of HeH$^+$ in NGC 7027 is modeled with the CLOUDY photoionization code using updated reaction rate coefficients. The non-LTE analysis of the three observed HeH$^+$ emission lines is then performed with the CLOUDY and RADEX codes using an extensive set of spectroscopic and inelastic collisional data suitable for the specific high-temperature environment of NGC 7027. In a second approach, chemical formation and destruction rates of HeH$^+$ are implemented in RADEX. This code is combined with MCMC sampling (performed on the RADEX-parameters space) to extract the best-fit HeH$^+$ column density and physical conditions from the observed line fluxes. The CLOUDY and RADEX non-LTE results are found to be in good agreement, and the $\upsilon=1-0 \ P(2)/P(1)$ line ratio is better than 20%. Agreement to better than a factor of 2.3 is obtained when including the reaction between He($2^3S$) and H as an additional source of HeH$^+$. The RADEX/MCMC model with chemical pumping is found to reproduce both the observed line fluxes and the line ratio to 20%. Our results suggest that additional HeH$^+$ lines must be detected in NGC 7027 to better constrain the physical conditions via non-LTE models. Uncertainties in collisional (reactive and inelastic) data of HeH$^+$ have been largely reduced in this work. The three observed lines are not sensitive to chemical pumping while excited "short-lived" levels are significantly overpopulated with respect to a non-LTE model neglecting chemical excitation.

 - **Abstract**
 Most globular clusters in the local group show multiple stellar populations, a pattern defined by variations of several light elements, with some also displaying dispersions in heavy elements. Since helium is the most immediate product of hydrogen burning, almost all models suggest that second-generation stars should show different levels of helium enrichment than first-generation stars. Therefore, investigating helium enrichment in stellar populations of globular clusters can constrain different theoretical models. Using the deep photometry carried out by the {\sl Hubble} Space Telescope, we have analyzed the morphologies of the main sequences of four Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, Hodge 11, NGC 1841, NGC 2210, and NGC 2257. We aim to constrain the helium distributions among their main sequence stars. We found a clear broadening of main sequences in all four clusters. After excluding the effects of photometric errors, differential reddening, unresolved binaries, and metallicity dispersions, this broadening would suggest a substantial helium enrichment in their star populations, ranging from $\delta{Y}=0.08$ to $\delta{Y}\geq0.12$, depending on the presumed helium distributions. Helium-enriched stars are comparable in number to normal stars within these clusters, and may even dominate, comprising approximately $\sim$40\% to over 80\% of the total stellar population. However, given the great distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it is difficult to rule out the significant impact of crowding, so our results may only represent an upper limit.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the confirmation of TOI-6324 b, an Earth-sized (1.059 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_\oplus$) ultra-short-period (USP) planet orbiting a nearby ($\sim$20 pc) M dwarf. Using the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph, we have measured the mass of TOI-6324 b 1.17 $\pm$ 0.22 M$_\oplus$. Because of its extremely short orbit of just $\sim$6.7 hours, TOI-6324 b is intensely irradiated by its M dwarf host, and is expected to be stripped of any thick, H/He envelope. We were able to constrain its interior composition and found an iron core mass fraction (CMF = 27$\pm$37%) consistent with that of Earth ($\sim$33%) and other confirmed USPs. TOI-6324 b is the closest to Earth-sized USP confirmed to date. TOI-6324 b is a promising target for JWST phase curve and secondary eclipse observations (Emission Spectroscopy Metric = 25) which may reveal its surface mineralogy, day-night temperature contrast, and possible tidal deformation. From 7 sectors of TESS data, we report a tentative detection of the optical phase curve variation with an amplitude of 42$\pm$28 ppm.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Trojan asteroids of Mars date from an early phase of solar system evolution. Based on a sample of <10 asteroids, MT distribution has been previously shown to be both asymmetric and inhomogeneous with population evolution dominated by thermal radiation forces acting over timescales of Gyr. Remarkably, a single asteroid family associated with (5261) Eureka (H~16) at L5 contains most MTs and all members of the stable population fainter than H=18. Aims. Using the currently available sample of MTs and their orbits, we take a fresh look at this population to re-evaluate these earlier conclusions and to search for additional features diagnostic of the evolutionary history of MTs and the Eureka family in particular. Methods. We perform harmonic analysis on numerical time series of the osculating elements to compile a new proper element catalogue comprising 16 L5 and 1 L4 Mars Trojan asteroids. We then combine sample variance analysis with statistical hypothesis testing to identify clusters in the distribution of orbits and assess their significance. Results. We identify two small clusterings significant at 95% confidence of three H=20-21 asteroids each and investigate their likely origin. One of the clusters is probably the result of rotational breakup of a Eureka family asteroid ~10^8 yr ago. The significantly higher tadpole libration width of asteroids in the other cluster is more consistent with an origin as impact ejecta from Eureka itself and on a timescale comparable to the ~1 Gyr age of its family. We further confirm the previously reported correlations in Eureka family orbital distribution attributed to the long-term action of radiation-driven forces and torques on the asteroids.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects, are a significant product of star formation. Their sensitivity to initial conditions and early dynamical evolution makes them especially valuable for studying both planetary and stellar formation processes. Aims. We search for brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects in a young star forming region to better constrain their formation mechanisms. Methods. We take advantage of Euclid unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and wide-field of view to search for brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects in the LDN 1495 region of the Taurus molecular clouds. We combine the recent Euclid Early Release Observations with older very deep ground-based images obtained over more than 20 yr to derive proper motions and multi-wavelength photometry, and select members based on their morphology and their position in a proper motion diagram and in 9 color-magnitude diagrams. Results. We identify 15 point sources with proper motions, colors, and luminosity consistent with being members of LDN 1495. Six of these objects were already known M9-L1 members. The remaining nine are newly identified sources that could have spectral types ranging from late-M to early-T with masses potentially as low as 1-2 MJup based on their luminosity and according to evolutionary models. However, follow-up observations are needed to confirm their nature, spectral type and membership. If extrapolated to theentire Taurus star forming region, this result suggests the potential presence of several dozen free-floating planetary mass objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. As the Solar System orbits the Milky Way, it encounters various Galactic environments, including dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM). These encounters can compress the heliosphere, exposing parts of the Solar System to the ISM, while also increasing the influx of interstellar dust into the Solar System and Earth's atmosphere. The discovery of new Galactic structures, such as the Radcliffe wave, raises the question of whether the Sun has encountered any of them. Aims. The present study investigates the potential passage of the Solar System through the Radcliffe wave gas structure over the past 30 million years (Myr). Methods. We used a sample of 56 high-quality, young ($\leq$ 30 Myr) open clusters associated with a region of interest of the Radcliffe wave to trace its motion back and investigate a potential crossing with the Solar System's past orbit. Results. We find that the Solar System's trajectory intersected the Radcliffe wave in the Orion region. We have constrained the timing of this event to between 18.2 and 11.5 Myr ago, with the closest approach occurring between 14.8 and 12.4 Myr ago. Notably, this period coincides with the Middle Miocene climate transition on Earth, providing an interdisciplinary link with paleoclimatology. The potential impact of the crossing of the Radcliffe wave on the climate on Earth is estimated. This crossing could also lead to anomalies in radionuclide abundances, which is an important research topic in the field of geology and nuclear astrophysics.
#### Dense Cores in IRDC G14.225-0.506 revealed by ALMA Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Dense cores in massive, parsec-scale molecular clumps are sites that harbor protocluster formation. We present results from observations towards a hub-filament structure of a massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G14.225-0.506 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dense cores are revealed by the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission at an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1.5'' and are identified through the hierarchical Dendrogram technique. Combining with the N$_2$D$^+$ 3-2 spectral line emission and gas temperatures derived from a previous NH$_3$ study, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the dense cores. The results show transonic and supersonic-dominated turbulent motions. There is an inverse correlation between the virial parameter and the column density, which implies that denser regions may undergo stronger gravitational collapse. Molecular outflows are identified in the CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 emission, indicating active protostellar activities in some cores. Besides these star formation signatures revealed by molecular outflows in the dense cores, previous studies in the infrared, X-ray, and radio wavelengths also found a rich and wide-spread population of young stellar objects (YSOs), showing active star formation both inside and outside of the dense cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Asteroid shape inversion using photometric data has been a key area of study in planetary science and astronomical this http URL, the current methods for asteroid shape inversion require extensive iterative calculations, making the process time-consuming and prone to becoming stuck in local optima. We directly established a mapping between photometric data and shape distribution through deep neural networks. In addition, we used 3D point clouds to represent asteroid shapes and utilized the deviation between the light curves of non-convex asteroids and their convex hulls to predict the concave areas of non-convex asteroids. We compared the results of different shape models using the Chamfer distance between traditional methods and ours and found that our method performs better, especially when handling special shapes. For the detection of concave areas on the convex hull, the intersection over union (IoU) of our predictions reached 0.89. We further validated this method using observational data from the Lowell Observatory to predict the convex shapes of the asteroids 3337 Milo and 1289 Kuta, and conducted light curve fitting experiments. The experimental results demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of the method
#### The extreme starburst J1044+0353 blows kpc-scale bubbles

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of a kpc-scale lacy filamentary structure in low surface-brightness H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda5007$ emission around the low-redshift, extremely metal-poor, and compact reionisation-era analogue SDSS J1044+0535. We identify seven elliptical arcs in H$\alpha$ emission at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} \sim 1 - 2 \times 10^{-18}$erg\,s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. These arcs extent 6-9 kpc outwards from the star-forming complexes. We interpret these features as limb-brightened giant-shells that bound egg-shaped kpc-scale bubbles. These shells are five to eight times larger than the known giant-shells around nearby star-forming dwarfs. Kinematic maps reveal a gradient perpendicular to the major-axis and line broadening in the outskirts. The latter, when interpreted due to line-splitting of the expanding shells, provides an estimate of the kinetic energy of the bubbles that can be well reconciled with them being blown by the mass dominating 15-20 Myr old stellar population.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation galaxy surveys promise unprecedented precision in testing gravity at cosmological scales. However, realising this potential requires accurately modelling the non-linear cosmic web. We address this challenge by exploring conditional generative modelling to create 3D dark matter density fields via score-based (diffusion) and flow-based methods. Our results demonstrate the power of diffusion models to accurately reproduce the matter power spectra and bispectra, even for unseen configurations. They also offer a significant speed-up with slightly reduced accuracy, when flow-based reconstructing the probability distribution function, but they struggle with higher-order statistics. To improve conditional generation, we introduce a novel multi-output model to develop feature representations of the cosmological parameters. Our findings offer a powerful tool for exploring deviations from standard gravity, combining high precision with reduced computational cost, thus paving the way for more comprehensive and efficient cosmological analyses
#### Accretion bursts in young intermediate-mass stars make planet formation challenging

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the occurrence of accretion bursts, dust accumulation, and the prospects for planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk with globally suppressed but episodically triggered magnetorotational instability (MRI), particularly in young intermediate-mass stars (YIMSs) but with a brief comparison to low-mass counterparts. We use numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit (FEOSAD code) to model the formation and long-term evolution of a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk, including dust dynamics and growth, since the collapse of a massive slowly-rotating prestellar cloud core. Massive gas concentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the radially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability (GI). These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI). However, gradual warming of the dust rings, thanks to high opacity and GI-induced influx of matter increases the gas temperature above a threshold for the MRI to develop via thermal ionization of alkaline metals. The ensuing MRI bursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI problematic. In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to diminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and more extended inner dead zone, both acting to reduce the dust concentration below the threshold for SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less affected by these adverse effects. Our results suggest that disks around young intermediate-mass stars may be challenging environments for planetesimal formation via SI. This may explain the dearth of planets around stars with $M_\ast > 3.0 \,$$M_\odot$.
#### The Starburst Acceleration of High-Velocity Clouds in the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 High-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the Galactic center have garnered significant attention due to their mysterious formation, potentially linked to starburst events or supermassive black hole activity in the region. However, it remains challenging to explain the observed column density and velocity distribution of HVCs. The discovery of high-velocity molecular clouds (HVMCs), which are denser and more massive, adds to this complexity. To address this, we conduct three-dimensional numerical simulations to explore the origin and magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of HVCs in the context of a starburst in the Galactic center. By incorporating magnetic fields and an initial tangential velocity for the clouds, our simulation results align with the observed properties of HVCs, supporting the notion that these clouds can originate from a starburst process. In addition, ~5% of the total mass of initial clouds can survive after 3.5 Myr, as a result, the following star formation will be more efficient than a feedback process that destroys all cool clouds.
#### A JWST Panchromatic Thermal Emission Spectrum of the Warm Neptune Archetype GJ 436b

 - **Abstract**
 GJ 436b is the archetype warm Neptune exoplanet. The planet's thermal emission spectrum was previously observed via intensive secondary eclipse campaigns with Spitzer. The atmosphere has long been interpreted to be extremely metal-rich, out of chemical equilibrium, and potentially tidally heated. We present the first panchromatic emission spectrum of GJ 436b observed with JWST's NIRCAM (F322W2 and F444W) and MIRI (LRS) instruments between 2.4 and 11.9 $\mu$m. Surprisingly, the JWST spectrum appears significantly fainter around 3.6 $\mu$m than that implied by Spitzer photometry. The molecular absorption features in the spectrum are relatively weak, and we only find tentative evidence of CO$_2$ absorption at 2$\sigma$ significance. Under the assumption of a day-side blackbody, we find $T_{\rm day}$=662.8$\pm$5.0 K, which is similar to the zero Bond albedo equilibrium temperature. We use it to obtain a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the Bond albedo of $A_B{\le}$0.66. To understand the spectrum we employ 1D radiative-convective models but find that atmospheric constraints depend strongly on model assumptions. If thermochemical equilibrium is assumed, we find a cloudy metal-enriched atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 300$\times$solar). We employ 1D photochemical modeling to show that the observed spectrum is also consistent with a cloud-free, relatively lower-metallicity atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 80$\times$solar) with a cold internal temperature ($T_{\rm int}$$\sim$60 K). These are much lower metallicities and internal temperatures than inferences from Spitzer photometry. The low $T_{\rm day}$ and non-detection of transmission features at high spectral resolution does suggest a role for cloud opacity, but this is not definitive.

 - **Abstract**
 Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.
