 - **Abstract**
 Current star formation models are based on the local structure of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet the details on how the small-scale physics propagates up to global galactic-scale properties are still under debate. To investigate this we use {\small VINTERGATAN}, a high-resolution (20 pc) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We study how the velocity dispersion and density structure of the ISM on 50-100 pc scales evolve with redshift, and quantify their impact on the star formation efficiency per free-fall timescale, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. During starbursts the ISM can reach velocity dispersions as high as $\sim 50$ km s$^{-1}$ for the densest and coldest gas, most noticeable during the last major merger event ($1.3 < z < 1.5$). After a merger-dominated phase ($1<z<5$), {\small VINTERGATAN} transitions into evolving secularly, with the cold neutral ISM typically featuring velocity dispersion levels of $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Despite strongly evolving density and turbulence distributions over cosmic time, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ at the resolution limit is found to change by only a factor of a few: from median efficiencies of 0.8\% at $z>1$ to 0.3\% at $z<1$. The mass-weighted average shows a universal $\langle \epsilon_{\rm ff} \rangle \approx 1\%$, caused by an almost invariant virial parameter distribution in star forming clouds. Changes in their density and turbulence levels are coupled so the kinetic-to-gravitational energy ratio remains close to constant. Finally, we show that a \textit{theoretically} motivated instantaneous $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is intrinsically different to its \textit{observational} estimates adopting tracers of star formation e.g. H$\alpha$. Since the physics underlying star formation can be lost on short ($\sim$ 10 Myr) timescales, caution must be taken when constraining star formation models from observational estimates of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.
#### Connecting integrated RGB mass loss from asteroseismology and globular clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Asteroseismic investigations of solar-like oscillations in giant stars enable the derivation of their masses and radii. For mono-age mono-metallicity populations of stars this allows the integrated red giant branch (RGB) mass loss to be estimated by comparing the median mass of the low-luminosity RGB stars to that of the helium-core-burning stars (HeCB). Aims. We aim to exploit quasi mono-age mono-metallicity populations of field stars in the $\alpha$-rich sequence of the Milky Way (MW) to derive the integrated mass loss and its dependence on metallicity. By comparing to metal-rich globular clusters (GCs), we wish to determine whether the RGB mass loss differs in the two environments. Methods. Catalogues of asteroseismic parameters based on time-series photometry from the Kepler and K2 missions cross-matched to spectroscopic information from APOGEE-DR17, photometry from 2MASS, parallaxes from Gaia DR3 and reddening maps are utilised. The RGB mass loss is determined by comparing mass distributions of RGB and HeCB stars in three metallicity bins. For two GCs, the mass loss is derived from colour-magnitude diagrams. Results. Integrated RGB mass loss is found to increase with decreasing metallicity and/or mass in the [Fe/H] range from -0.9 to +0.0. At [Fe/H]=-0.50 the RGB mass loss of MW $\alpha$-rich field stars is compatible with that in GCs of the same metallicity. Conclusions. We provide novel empirical determinations of the integrated mass loss connecting field stars and GC stars at comparable metallicities. These show that mass loss cannot be accurately described by a Reimers mass-loss law with a single value of $\eta$. This should encourage further theoretical developments aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of the processes involved in mass loss.
#### Thousands of planetesimals: Simulating the streaming Instability in very large computational domains
 - **Authors:** Urs Schäfer, Anders Johansen, Troels Haugbølle, Åke Nordlund

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability is a mechanism whereby pebble-sized particles in protoplanetary discs spontaneously come together in dense filaments, which collapse gravitationally to form planetesimals upon reaching the Roche density. The extent of the filaments along the orbital direction is nevertheless poorly characterised, due to a focus in the literature on small simulation domains where the behaviour of the streaming instability on large scales cannot be determined. We present here computer simulations of the streaming instability in boxes with side lengths up to 6.4 scale heights in the plane. This is 32 times larger than typically considered simulation domains and nearly a factor 1,000 times the volume. We show that the azimuthal extent of filaments in the non-linear state of the streaming instability is limited to approximately one gas scale height. The streaming instability will therefore not transform the pebble density field into axisymmetric rings; rather the non-linear state of the streaming instability appears as a complex structure of loosely connected filaments. Including the self-gravity of the pebbles, our simulations form up to 4,000 planetesimals. This allows us to probe the high-mass end of the initial mass function of planetesimals with much higher statistical confidence than previously. We find that this end is well-described by a steep exponential tapering. Since the resolution of our simulations is moderate -- a necessary trade-off given the large domains -- the mass distribution is incomplete at the low-mass end. When putting comparatively less weight on the numbers at low masses, at intermediate masses we nevertheless reproduce the power-law shape of the distribution established in previous studies.
#### Assessing Core-Powered Mass Loss in the Context of Early Boil-Off: Minimal Long-Lived Mass Loss for the Sub-Neptune Population

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a python-based state-of-the-art sub-Neptune evolution model that incorporates both the post-formation boil-off at young ages $\leq$ 1 Myr and long-lived core-powered mass loss ($\sim$ Gyrs) from interior cooling. We investigate the roles of initial H/He entropy, core luminosity, energy advection, radiative atmospheric structure, and the transition to an XUV-driven mass-loss phase, with an eye on relevant timescales for planetary mass loss and thermal evolution. With particular attention to the re-equilibration process of the H/He envelope, including the energy sources that fuel the hydrodynamic wind, and energy transport timescales, we find boil-off and core-powered escape are primarily driven by stellar bolometric radiation. We further find that both boil-off and core-powered escape are decoupled from the thermal evolution. We show that, with a boil-off phase that accounts for the initial H/He mass fraction and initial entropy, post-boil-off core-powered escape has an insignificant influence on the demographics of small planets, as it is only able to remove at most 0.1% of the H/He mass fraction. Our numerical results are directly compared to previous work on analytical core-powered mass loss modeling for individual evolutionary trajectories and populations of small planets. We examine a number of assumptions made in previous studies that cause significant differences compared to our findings. We find that boil-off, though able to completely strip the gaseous envelope from a highly irradiated ($F \geq 100 F_\oplus$) planet that has a low-mass core ($M_c \leq 4M_\oplus$), cannot by itself form a pronounced radius gap as is seen in the observed population.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most promising techniques for detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos involves the use of radio antennas to observe the 10-1000 MHz radiation generated by the showers that neutrinos induce in large volumes of ice. The expected neutrino detection rates of one neutrino or less per detector station per 10 years make the characterization of backgrounds a priority. The largest natural background comes from ultra-high energy cosmic rays which are orders of magnitude more abundant than neutrinos. Particularly crucial is the understanding of geometries in which substantial energy of the cosmic-ray-induced air shower is deposited in the ice giving rise to a compact in-ice shower close to the ice surface. We calculated the radio emission of air-shower cores using the novel CORSIKA 8 code and found it to be similar to the predictions for neutrino-induced showers. For the first time, we calculated the detection rates for O(100m) deep antennas yielding 10-100 detections per year and detector station, which makes this a useful calibration source as these downward-going signals can be differentiated from neutrino-induced showers based on the signal arrival direction. However, the presence of reflection layers in the ice confuses the arrival directions, which makes this a potentially important background. We review the existing information on reflecting layers in the South Pole glacier and, for the first time, quantify the corresponding rate of reflected air-shower signals for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 radio array and discuss mitigation strategies. The reflectivity of the layers is the dominant uncertainty resulting in rate predictions of much less than one detection to several detections per year for IceCube-Gen2 if not mitigated.

 - **Abstract**
 The ubiquitous phenomena of crystallization and melting occur in various geophysical contexts across many spatial and temporal scales. In particular, they take place in the iron core of terrestrial planets and moons, profoundly influencing their dynamics and magnetic field generation. Crystallization and melting entail intricate multiphase flows, buoyancy effects, and out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, posing challenges for theoretical modeling and numerical simulations. Besides, due to the inaccessible nature of the planetary deep interior, our understanding relies on indirect data from seismology, mineral physics, geochemistry, and magnetism. Consequently, phase-change-driven flows in planetary cores constitute a compelling yet challenging area of research. This paper provides an overview of the role of laboratory fluid dynamics experiments in elucidating the solid-liquid phase change phenomena occurring thousands of kilometers beneath our feet and within other planetary depths, along with their dynamic repercussions. Drawing parallel with metallurgy, it navigates through all scales of phase change dynamics, from microscopic processes (nucleation and crystal growth) to macroscopic consequences (solid-liquid segregation and large-scale flows). The review delves into the two primary planetary solidification regimes, top-down and bottom-up, and elucidates the formation of mushy and/or slurry layers in the various relevant configurations. Additionally, it outlines remaining challenges, including insights from ongoing space missions poised to unveil the diverse planetary regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We used TESS observations to search for pulsations in six known Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds. We find evidence for pulsational variability in three Of?p stars: UCAC4 115-008604, OGLE SMC-SC6 237339, and AzV 220. Two of them, UCAC4 115-008604 and OGLE SMC-SC6 237339, have been reported to possess kG-order magnetic fields. The obtained results are important to constrain and improve stellar evolution models.
#### BD+44 493: Chemo-Dynamical Analysis and Constraints on Companion Planetary Masses from WIYN/NEID Spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present high-resolution (R~100,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N~800) spectroscopic observations for the well-known, bright, extremely metal-poor, carbon-enhanced star BD+44 493. We determined chemical abundances and upper limits for 17 elements from WIYN/NEID data, complemented with 11 abundances re-determined from Subaru and Hubble data, using the new, more accurate, stellar atmospheric parameters calculated in this work. Our analysis suggests that BD+44 493 is a low-mass (0.83Msun) old (12.1-13.2Gyr) second-generation star likely formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single metal-free 20.5Msun Population III star in the early Universe. With a disk-like orbit, BD+44 493 does not appear to be associated with any major merger event in the early history of the Milky Way. From the precision radial-velocity NEID measurements (median absolute deviation - MAD=16m/s), we were able to constrain companion planetary masses around BD+44 493 and rule out the presence of planets as small as msin(i)=2MJ out to periods of 100 days. This study opens a new avenue of exploration for the intersection between stellar archaeology and exoplanet science using NEID.
#### Wolf-Rayet -- compact object binaries as progenitors of binary compact objects

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries with a Wolf-Rayet star and a compact object (WR-COs), either a black hole (BH) or a neutron star (NS), have been proposed as possible progenitors for the binary compact object mergers (BCOs) observed with the gravitational wave (GW) detectors. In this work, we use the open-source population synthesis code SEVN to investigate the role of WR-COs as BCO progenitors. We consider an initial population of $5 \times 10^6$ binaries and we evolve it across 96 combinations of metallicities, common envelope efficiencies, core-collapse supernova models and natal kick distributions. We find that WR-COs are the progenitors of most BCOs, especially at high and intermediate metallicity. At $Z=0.02,\,{}0.014,$ and $0.0014$, more than $\gtrsim 99 \%$ of all the BCOs in our simulations evolved as WR-COs. At $Z = 0.00014$, inefficient binary-stripping lowers the fraction of BCOs with WR-CO progenitors to $\approx 83-95 \%$. Despite their key role in BCO production, only $\approx 5-30 \%$ of WR-COs end their life as BCOs. We find that Cyg X-3, the only WR-CO candidate observed in the Milky Way, is a promising BCO progenitor, especially if it hosts a BH. In our simulations, about $\approx 70-100 \%$ of the Cyg X-3 - like systems in the WR-BH configuration (BH mass $ \leq 10 \rm ~ M_\odot$) are BCO progenitors, in agreement with the literature. Future observations of WR-COs similar to Cyg X-3 may be the Rosetta stone to interpret the formation of BCOs.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes (BH), one of the most intriguing objects in the universe, can manifest themselves through electromagnetic radiations initiated by the accretion flow. Some stellar-mass BHs drive relativistic jets when accreting matter from their companion stars, called microquasars. Non-thermal emission from the radio to tera-electronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray band has been observed from microquasars, indicating acceleration of relativistic particles by the system. Here we report detection of ultrahigh-energy (UHE, photon energy $E>100$TeV) gamma-ray associated with 5 out of 12 microquasars harboring BHs visible by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, namely, SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070, and Cygnus X-1. In the central region of SS 433, extended UHE emission is detected in spatial coincidence with a giant gas cloud, suggesting the hadronic origin of the emission. An elongated source is discovered from V4641 Sgr with the spectrum continuing up to 800 TeV. GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070 and Cygnus X-1 are detected with quasi-stable radiations up to $\sim$100 TeV. The detection of UHE gamma-rays demonstrates that accreting BHs and their environments can operate as extremely efficient accelerators of particles out of 1 peta-electronvolt (PeV), thus contributing to Galactic cosmic rays especially around the `knee' region.
#### A JWST/MIRI View of the ISM in M83: I. Resolved Molecular Hydrogen Properties, Star Formation, and Feedback

 - **Abstract**
 We present a spatially-resolved (~3 pc pix$^{-1}$) analysis of the distribution, kinematics, and excitation of warm H2 gas in the nuclear starburst region of M83. Our JWST/MIRI IFU spectroscopy reveals a clumpy reservoir of warm H2 (> 200 K) with a mass of ~2.3 x 10$^{5}$ Msun in the area covered by all four MRS channels. We additionally use the [Ne II] 12.8 ${\mu}$m and [Ne III] 15.5 ${\mu}$m lines as tracers of the star formation rate, ionizing radiation hardness, and kinematics of the ionized ISM, finding tantalizing connections to the H2 properties and to the ages of the underlying stellar populations. Finally, qualitative comparisons to the trove of public, high-spatial-resolution multiwavelength data available on M83 shows that our MRS spectroscopy potentially traces all stages of the process of creating massive star clusters, from the embedded proto-cluster phase through the dispersion of ISM from stellar feedback.
