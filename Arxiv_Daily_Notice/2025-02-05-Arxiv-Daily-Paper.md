 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are produced by the Hills mechanism when a stellar binary is disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The HVS Survey detected 21 unbound B-type main-sequence stars in the Milky Way's outer halo that are consistent with ejection via the Hills mechanism. We revisit the trajectories of these stars in light of proper motions from {\it Gaia} DR3 and modern constraints on the Milky Way -- Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) orbit. We find that half of the unbound HVSs discovered by the HVS Survey trace back not the Galactic Center, but to the LMC. Motivated by this finding, we construct a forward-model for HVSs ejected from an SMBH in the LMC and observed through the selection function of the HVS Survey. The predicted spatial and kinematic distributions of simulated HVSs are remarkably similar to the observed distributions. In particular, we reproduce the conspicuous angular clustering of HVSs around the constellation Leo. This clustering occurs because HVSs from the LMC are boosted by $\sim300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ by the orbital motion of the LMC, and stars launched parallel to this motion are preferentially selected as HVS candidates. We find that the birth rate and clustering of LMC HVSs cannot be explained by supernova runaways or dynamical ejection scenarios not involving a SMBH. From the ejection velocities and relative number of Magellanic vs. Galactic HVSs, we constrain the mass of the LMC SMBH to be $10^{5.8^{+0.2}_{-0.4}} M_{\odot}$ ($\simeq 6\times10^5 M_{\odot}$).

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a deep learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II, an updated model targeted towards providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star-black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values, making it more interpretable. For significant O4 event alerts issued between May 2023 and December 2024, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.

 - **Abstract**
 Formaldehyde is a key precursor in the formation routes of many complex organic molecules (COMs) in space. It is also an intermediate step in CO hydrogenation sequence that leads to methanol formation on the surface of interstellar grains in cold dense prestellar cores where pristine ices are formed. Various chemical models successfully reproduce the COMs abundances in cold cores, however, they consistently overpredict the abundance of formaldehyde by an order of magnitude. This results in an inverse H2CO:CH3OH abundance ratios obtained in the astrochemical simulations as compared to the observed values. In this work, we present a homogeneous data set of formaldehyde observational maps obtained towards seven dense cores in the L1495 filament with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Resolving the spatial distribution of the molecules is essential to test the chemical models. We carefully estimate the formaldehyde column densities and abundances to put reliable observational constraints on the chemical models of cold cores. Through numerous tests, we aim to constrain the updated chemical model MONACO to better align with the observed formaldehyde abundance and its ratio to methanol. In particular, we elaborate on the branching ratio of the CH3 + O reaction at low temperatures. The revised MONACO model reproduces abundances of both methanol and formaldehyde within an order of magnitude. However the model tends to overproduce formaldehyde and underpredict methanol. Consequently, the model systematically overestimates the H2CO:CH3OH ratio, although it remains within an order of magnitude of the values derived from observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the properties of planets younger than about 50 Myr helps to test different planetary formation and evolution models. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, including a wide range of star-forming regions and young stellar clusters, expanding our census of the newborn planet population. In this work, we present the discovery of the TIC 88785435 planetary system located in the Upper-Centaurus Lupus (UCL) region of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association (Sco-Cen) and a preliminary survey of the planet population within Sco-Cen. TIC 88785435 is a pre-main sequence, K7V dwarf ($M_\star = 0.72M_\odot$, $R_\star = 0.91R_\odot$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 3998K, V = 11.7 mag) located within the bounds of UCL. We investigate the distribution of rotation periods measured from the TESS long-cadence data and the Halpha and Li abundances from the spectra of TIC 88785435. TESS long-candence data reveal that TIC 88785435 hosts a transiting super-Neptune ($R_b = 5.03R_\oplus$, P = 10.51 days), TIC 88785435 b. Ground-based follow-up validates the planetary nature of TIC 88785435 b. Using the TESS data, we perform a preliminary survey to investigate how TIC 88785435 b compares to the population of newly born planets located within Sco-Cen.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we train score-based diffusion models to super-resolve gigaparsec-scale cosmological simulations of the 21-cm signal. We examine the impact of network and training dataset size on model performance, demonstrating that a single simulation is sufficient for a model to learn the super-resolution task regardless of the initial conditions. Our best-performing model achieves pixelwise $\mathrm{RMSE}\sim0.57\ \mathrm{mK}$ and dimensionless power spectrum residuals ranging from $10^{-2}-10^{-1}\ \mathrm{mK^2}$ for $128^3$, $256^3$ and $512^3$ voxel simulation volumes at redshift $10$. The super-resolution network ultimately allows us to utilize all spatial scales covered by the SKA1-Low instrument, and could in future be employed to help constrain the astrophysics of the early Universe.
#### The survey of planetary nebulae in Andromeda (M31) VII. Predictions of a major merger simulation model compared with chemodynamical data of the disc and inner halo substructures

 - **Abstract**
 The nearest spiral galaxy, M31, exhibits a kinematically hot stellar disc, a global star formation episode ~2-4 Gyr ago, and conspicuous substructures in its stellar halo, suggestive of a recent accretion event. Recent chemodynamical measurements in the M31 disc and inner halo can be used as additional constraints for N-body hydrodynamical simulations that successfully reproduce the disc age-velocity dispersion relation and star formation history, together with the morphology of the inner halo substructures. We combine an available N-body hydrodynamical simulation of a major merger (mass ratio 1:4) with a well-motivated chemical model to predict abundance distributions and gradients in the merger remnant at z=0. We computed the projected phase space and the [M/H] distributions for the substructures in the M31 inner halo, i.e. the GS, the NE-, W- Shelves. We compare these chemodynamical properties of the simulated M31 remnant with recent measurements for the M31 stars in the inner halo. This major merger model predicts (i) distinct multiple components within each of the substructure; (ii) a high mean metallicity and large spread in the GS, NE- and W- Shelves, explaining various photometric and spectroscopic metallicity measurements; (iii) simulated phase space diagrams that qualitatively reproduce various features identified in the projected phase space of the substructures in published data from the DESI; (iv) a large distance spread in the GS, as suggested by previous tip of the RGB measurements, and (v) phase space ridges caused by several wraps of the secondary, as well as up-scattered main M31 disc stars, that also have plausible counterparts in the observed phase spaces. These results provide further independent arguments for a major satellite merger in M31 ~3 Gyr ago and a coherent explanation for many of the observational results that make M31 look so different from the MW.
#### QUOKKA-based understanding of outflows (QED) -- III. Outflow loading and phase structure as a function of galactic environment

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a suite of 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of supernova-driven outflows from galactic disc regions with a range of gas surface density, metallicity, and supernova scale height. We use this suite to quantify how outflow properties -- particularly the loading factors for mass, metallicity, and energy -- vary with these parameters. We find that the winds fall into three broad categories: steady and hot, multiphase and moderately bursty, and cool and highly bursty. The first of these is characterised by efficient metal and energy loading but weak mass loading, the second by moderate loading of mass, metals, and energy, and the third by negligible metal and energy loading but substantial mass loading. The most important factor in determining the kind of wind a galaxy will produce is the ratio of supernova to gas gas scale heights, with the latter set by a combination of supernova rate, metallicity-dependent cooling rate, and the gravitational potential. These often combine in counterintuitive ways -- for example increased cooling causes cold clouds to sink into the galactic midplane more rapidly, lowering the volume-filling factor of dense gas and making the environment more favourable for strong winds. Our findings suggest that the nature of galactic winds is likely highly sensitive to phenomena such as runaway stars occuring at a large height and dense gas and are poorly captured in most simulations, and that metal loading factors for type Ia supernovae may be substantially larger than those for type II, with important implications for galactic chemical evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The HI distribution at high Galactic latitudes is found to be filamentary and closely related to the far infrared (FIR) in caustics with coherent velocity structures. These structures trace the orientation of the magnetic field lines. Aims. Recent absorption observations with the Australian SKA Pathfinder Telescope have led to major improvements in our understanding of the physical properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. We use these results to explore how far the physical state of the CNM may be related with caustics in HI and FIR. Methods. We trace filamentary FIR and HI structures and probe the absorption data for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. 57 percent of the absorption positions are associated with known FIR/HI caustics, filamentary dusty structures with a coherent velocity field. The remaining part of the absorption sample is coincident in position and velocity with genuine HI filaments that are closely related to the FIR counterparts. Thus, within the current sensitivity limitations, all of the positions with HI absorption lines are associated with filamentary structures in FIR and/or HI. We summarize physical parameters for then CNM along filaments in the framework of filament velocities that have been determined from a Hessian analysis of FIR and HI emission data. Velocity deviations between absorption components and filament velocities are due to local turbulence and we determine for the observed CNM an average turbulent velocity dispersion of 2.48 < delta_vturb < 3.9 km/s. The CNM has a mean turbulent Mach number of Mt = 3.4 +/- 1.6 km/s. Conclusions. Most, if not all, of the CNM in the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitudes is located in filaments, identified as caustics with the Hessian operator.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Protostellar jets driven by massive protostars are collimated outflows producing high-speed shocks through dense interstellar medium. Fast shocks can accelerate particles up to relativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration, producing non-thermal emission that can originate ${\gamma}$-ray photons. HH 80-81 is one of the most powerful collimated protostellar jets in our galaxy, with non-thermal emission detected in radio, X-ray, and ${\gamma}$-ray bands. Characterize the ${\gamma}$-ray emission originated by the accelerated particles of the region is crucial for demonstrating the capability of protostars to accelerate cosmic rays. Aims. Our goal is to determine the particle distribution that is producing the ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum of HH 80-81 in order to ascertain the leptonic/hadronic origin of the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. We aim at associating the high-energy emission in the region with the HH 80-81 system, characterize its spectrum, and elaborate emission models based on what we expect from the diffusive shock acceleration. Methods. We use the 15 yr database provided by the Fermi-LAT satellite to study the high-energy emission of the jet, spanning from 300 MeV to 100 GeV. In addition, we perform a source association based on positional arguments. Then, we employ the naima and Gamera softwares to analyze the possible mechanisms that are producing ${\gamma}$-rays considering the ambient conditions. We perform a radiative fitting and study the nature of the particles behind the ${\gamma}$-ray emission. Results. By analyzing all the candidates to produce the ${\gamma}$-ray emission that we detect, we conclude that HH 80-81 is the most probable candidate to explain the ${\gamma}$-ray emission in the region. The detected spectrum can be explained by both hadronic and leptonic particle components.

 - **Abstract**
 The main goal of this work was to measure the masses and radii of white dwarfs that belong to widely separated, common proper motion binaries with non-degenerate companions. These can be assessed, independently from theoretical mass-radius relations, through measurements of gravitational redshifts and photometric radii. We studied 50 white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, performing a detailed analysis of high-resolution (R ~ 18,500) spectra by means of state-of-the-art grids of synthetic models and specialized software. Hence, we measured accurate radial velocities from the H-alpha and H-beta line-cores, thus obtaining the white dwarf gravitational redshifts. Jointly with a photometric analysis that is formalized by a Bayesian inference method, we measured precise white dwarf radii that allowed us to directly measure the white dwarf masses from their gravitational redshifts. The distributions of measured masses and radii agree within 6% (at the 1-sigma level) from the theoretical mass-radius relation, thus delivering a much smaller scatter in comparison with previous analyses that used gravitational redshift measurements from low-resolution spectra. A comparison against model-dependent spectroscopic estimates produces a larger scatter of 15% on the mass determinations. We find an agreement within ~10% from previous model-based, photometric mass estimates from the literature. Combining gravitational redshift measurements and photometric analysis of white dwarfs delivers precise and accurate, empirical estimates of their masses and radii. This work confirms the reliability of the theoretical mass-radius relation from the lightest to the heaviest white dwarfs in our sample (0.38-1.3 Msun). [abridged]
#### The Membership and Age of the Planet-hosting Young Star IRAS 04125+2902

 - **Abstract**
 A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus star-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known planets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one based on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study for a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North). However, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most temperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the observed sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr). Meanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field stars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations, so its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS 04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds (B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32 Ori. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes, but the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that >M4 stars at ages of <10 Myr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one member of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of 3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by happenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model isochrones.
#### Effects of planetary mass uncertainties on the interpretation of the reflectance spectra of Earth-like exoplanets

 - **Abstract**
 Atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets through reflected light spectroscopy is a key goal for upcoming direct imaging missions. A critical challenge in this endeavor is the accurate determination of planetary mass, which may influence the measurement of atmospheric compositions and the identification of potential biosignatures. In this study, we used the Bayesian retrieval framework ExoReL$^\Re$ to investigate the impact of planetary mass uncertainties on the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial exoplanets observed in reflected light. Our results indicate that precise prior knowledge of the planetary mass can be crucial for accurate atmospheric retrievals if clouds are present in the atmosphere. When the planetary mass is known within 10\% uncertainty, our retrievals successfully identified the background atmospheric gas and accurately constrained atmospheric parameters together with clouds. However, with less constrained or unknown planetary mass, we observed significant biases, particularly in the misidentification of the dominant atmospheric gas. For instance, the dominant gas was incorrectly identified as oxygen for a modern-Earth-like planet or carbon dioxide for an Archean-Earth-like planet, potentially leading to erroneous assessments of planetary habitability and biosignatures. These biases arise because, the uncertainties in planetary mass affect the determination of surface gravity and atmospheric scale height, leading the retrieval algorithm to compensate by adjusting the atmospheric composition. Our findings emphasize the importance of achieving precise mass measurements-ideally within 10\% uncertainty-through methods such as extreme precision radial velocity or astrometry, especially for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.
