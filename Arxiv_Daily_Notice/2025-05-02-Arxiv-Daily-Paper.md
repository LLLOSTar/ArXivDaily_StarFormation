 - **Abstract**
 Extended gamma-ray emission around isolated pulsars at TeV energies, also known as TeV halos, have been found around a handful of middle-aged pulsars. The halos are significantly more extended than their pulsar wind nebulae but much smaller than the particle diffusion length in the interstellar medium. The origin of TeV halos is unknown. Interpretations invoke either local effects related to the environment of a pulsar or generic particle transport behaviors. The latter scenario predicts that TeV halos would be a universal phenomena for all pulsars. We searched for extended gamma-ray emission around 36 isolated middle-aged pulsars identified by radio and gamma-ray facilities using 2321 days of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. Through a stacking analysis comparing TeV flux models against a background-only hypothesis, we identified TeV halo-like emission at a significance level of $5.10\,\sigma$. Our results imply that extended TeV gamma-ray halos may commonly exist around middle-aged pulsars. This reveals a previously unknown feature about pulsars and opens a new window to identify the pulsar population that is invisible to radio, x-ray, and GeV gamma-ray observations due to magnetospheric configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to measure NS radii to better than $\sigma=0.1$ km accuracy, providing unprecedented opportunities to extract novel information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model for NS EOS encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark phase transition and satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we investigate how NS radius data with higher precision may better inform us about (1) the NS crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$, (2) the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, quark matter fraction $F_{\rm{QM}}$ and its radius $R_{\rm{QM}}$, and (3) high-density NS EOS parameters. Using fiducial NS radius data with mocked precisions varying from $\sigma=1.0$ km to 0.1 km, we found (a) the most probable crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$ and its 68\% confidence boundaries are essentially unaffected by $\sigma$ especially for massive NSs; (b) our answers to the questions (2) and (3) listed above depend sensitively on the prior range of hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$ assumed. Using its fiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\rho_t$) has a major peak around $(1.7-2.0)\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing all existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\rho_0$ consistent with the indication about $\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan Experiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\rho_t$ to $(3.0-6.0)\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\sigma$ can constrain more stringently the posterior PDF($\rho_t$), $F_{\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\rm{QM}}$ and several high-density hadronic EOS parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 When a neutron star (NS) intercepts gas from a non-degenerate star, e.g., in a tidal disruption event, a common-envelope phase, or the collapsing core of a massive star, photons become trapped in the hot flow around the NS. This gas forms a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) until the density and temperature close to the NS surface grow large enough for binding energy to be converted to neutrinos. Here we present three-dimensional, general-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a non-rotating, unmagnetized NS. These connect, for the first time, an extended accretion disk with a self-consistent hydrostatic atmosphere around the star. The impact of different seed magnetic fields and accretion rates is studied by approximating the radiation-pressure dominated flow as an ideal gas with an adiabatic index of $4/3$, coupled to a variable neutrino emissivity. At low accretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak magnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic field mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the atmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the accretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these results with more general initial conditions and describing the main features of the flow. Our results have implications for the spin and mass evolution of hypercritically accreting NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 The prestellar core Barnard 68 (B68) is a prototypical source to study the initial conditions and chemical processes of star formation. A previous numerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main body of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping observations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were made with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and channel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected. The velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a solid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the bullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the velocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet is most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical non-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the radial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated intensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\prime\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from the core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger than 60$^{\prime\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is enhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock waves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core. In conclusion, based on the kinematical and chemical analysis, our observational results support the previously proposed core-core collision scenario in B68.
#### Dust density enhancements and the direct formation of planetary cores in gravitationally unstable discs

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can accumulate to form planetary cores. There are a number of barriers to the collisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift, or metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to cause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs, potentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from the disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that explore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is massive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density waves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and find that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an order of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid particles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to sufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo direct gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically between $1$ and $10$ M$_\oplus$. Thus, the concentration of dust in a self-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and directly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia DR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the number identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria, ASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15 to 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.
#### Luminosity Function of collapsar Gamma-Ray Bursts:the Progenitor of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts Is Not Singular

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful probes of the high-redshift universe. However, the proportion of collapsar GRBs among long GRBs and their event rate relative to the star formation rate (SFR) remain contentious issues. We assume that long GRBs with $z\geq 2$ are all collapsar GRBs and construct the luminosity function using a high-redshift sample from the Swift satellite spanning 2004 to 2019. We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law form and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and density evolution. Our results are as follows: 1) The no-evolution model can be ruled out. 2) The fitting results indicate that to adequately explain the observations, a significant redshift evolution in either luminosity (evolution index $\delta = 1.54^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$) or density ($\delta = 2.09^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$) is required. This excludes the possibility that the evolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from non-collapsar GRBs. 3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ is 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$. The density evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \geq 1 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ is 80.2, accounting for 47.7% of the observation. Regardless of the model, a substantial portion of the long GRBs are not collapsar GRBs.
