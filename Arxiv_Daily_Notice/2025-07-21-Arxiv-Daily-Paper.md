 - **Abstract**
 A crucial ingredient affecting fast neutrino flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is the shape of the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN). The presence of an ELN crossing signals favorable conditions for flavor conversion. However, the dependence of ELN crossings on the SN properties is only partially understood. We investigate a suite of 12 spherically symmetric neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of the core collapse of a SN with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$; each model employs different microphysics (i.e., three different nuclear equations of state, with and without muon creation) and includes or not a mixing-length treatment for proto-neutron star convection. We solve the Boltzmann equations to compute the neutrino angular distributions relying on static fluid properties extracted from each of the SN simulations in our suite for six selected post-bounce times. We explore the dependence of the ELN distributions on the SN microphysics and proto-neutron star convection. We find that the latter shifts the proto-neutron star radius outwards, favoring the appearance of ELN crossings at larger radii. On the other hand, muon creation causes proto-neutron star contraction, facilitating the occurrence of ELN crossings at smaller radii. These effects mildly depend on the nuclear equation of state. Our findings highlight the subtle impact of the SN microphysics, proto-neutron star convection, and neutrino transport on the ELN angular distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Sub-Neptune exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet known today. As they do not have a Solar System counterpart, many open questions exist about their composition and formation. Previous spectroscopic studies rule out aerosol-free hydrogen-helium-dominated atmospheres for many characterized sub-Neptunes but are inconclusive about their exact atmospheric compositions. Here we characterize the hot (Teq=1311K) sub-Neptune HD 86226 c, which orbits its G-type host star. Its high equilibrium temperature prohibits methane-based haze formation, increasing the chances for a clear atmosphere on this planet. We use HST data taken with WFC3 and STIS from the Sub-neptune Planetary Atmosphere Characterization Experiment (SPACE) Program to perform near-infrared 1.1-1.7micrometer transmission spectroscopy and UV characterization of the host star. We report a featureless transmission spectrum that is consistent within 0.4 sigma with a constant transit depth of 418+-14ppm. The amplitude of this spectrum is only 0.01 scale heights for a H/He-dominated atmosphere, excluding a cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere on HD 86226 c with a confidence of 6.5 sigma. Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis and forward models of cloud and haze formation, we find that the featureless spectrum could be due to a metal enrichment [M/H] above 2.3 (3 sigma confidence lower limit) of a cloudless atmosphere, or silicate (MgSiO3), iron (Fe), or manganese sulfide (MnS) clouds. For these species, we perform an investigation of cloud formation in high-metallicity, high-temperature atmospheres. Our results highlight that HD 86226c does not follow the aerosol trend of sub-Neptunes found by previous studies. Follow-up observations with the JWST could determine whether this planet aligns with the recent detections of metal-enriched atmospheres or if it harbors a cloud species otherwise atypical for sub-Neptunes.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A comprehensive study of comets over a wide heliocentric distance range helps us understand the physical processes driving their activity and reveals compositional differences across dynamical groups. C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) is a Dynamically New Oort Cloud comet (DNC) that showed activity as far as 23.75 au and displayed a CO-rich coma at 6.72 au, making it a key object to investigate pre- and post-perihelion behavior. Aims. We aim to study the long-term activity evolution and chemical composition of C/2017 K2 using photometry and spectroscopy, from October 2017 (r$_h$ = 15.18 au) pre-perihelion to April 2025 (r$_h$ = 8.46 au) post-perihelion. Methods. Broad-band and narrow-band imaging from both TRAPPIST telescopes enabled us to produce an 8-year light curve, color analysis, and derivation of activity slopes. Production rates of OH, NH, CN, C$_3$, and C$_2$ were computed using a Haser model, along with the dust proxy A(0)f$\rho$. High-resolution spectra from CRIRES$^+$ and UVES at three epochs (May - September 2022) provided simultaneous observations of parent and daughter species as the comet crossed the water sublimation zone. Results. The light curve of C/2017 K2 shows a complex evolution with varying slopes and a brightness plateau around perihelion, indicating multiple active species. Coma colors remained constant, suggesting uniform dust properties and similarity to other active long-period comets. Gas production rates indicate a typical C$_2$/CN composition with a high dust-to-gas ratio. Analysis of forbidden oxygen lines shows a transition from CO and CO$_2$-driven activity to water-driven sublimation inside 3 au. Infrared spectra reveal C/2017 K2 as a typical-to-enriched comet, with HCN identified as the main parent of CN, and C$_2$ likely originating from C$_2$H$_2$ rather than C$_2$H$_6$.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.

 - **Abstract**
 V960~Mon is an FU Orionis object that shows strong evidence of a gravitationally unstable spiral arm that is fragmenting into several dust clumps. We report the discovery of a new substellar companion candidate around this young star, identified in high-contrast $L'$-band imaging with VLT/ERIS. The object is detected at a projected separation of $0.898 \pm 0.01$ arcseconds with a contrast of $(8.39 \pm 0.07) \times 10^{-3}$. The candidate lies close to the clumps previously detected in the sub-mm (at 1.3 mm) and is co-located with extended polarized IR signal from scattered stellar irradiation, suggesting it is deeply embedded. The object is undetected in the SPHERE $H$-band total intensity, placing an upper mass limit of $\sim38~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the contrast curve. Using evolutionary models at an assumed age of 1~Myr, we estimate a mass of $\sim660~M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from the L' brightness; however, this value likely includes a significant contribution from a disk around the companion. The discrepancy between near- and mid-infrared results again suggests the source is deeply embedded in dust. This candidate may represent an actively accreting, disk-bearing substellar object in a young, gravitationally unstable environment.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally classified into long (lGRBs) and short (sGRBs) durations based on their $T_{90}$, with lGRBs widely used as tracers of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) due to their observed association with core-collapse supernovae. However, recent detections of kilonovae accompanying some lGRBs challenge this assumption, suggesting potential contamination from compact binary mergers. Here, we move beyond the conventional $T_{90}$-based classification and focus exclusively on GRBs directly associated with supernovae - the most direct signatures of massive stellar collapse - to reassess their connection to the SFR. Using a sample of SN/GRBs, we construct the luminosity - redshift ($L$-$z$) plane and uncover a significant correlation between these variables. To account for observational biases, we apply the $\tau$ statistic and Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method to derive the intrinsic luminosity function and formation rate. Our analysis reveals that even among this well-defined subsample, the SN/GRB formation rate still exceeds the SFR at low redshifts ($z < 1$). These findings suggest that GRBs at low redshift may not serve as reliable tracers of the SFR, and that larger samples are required to further investigate this discrepancy.
#### Probing neutrino emission at GeV energies from compact binary mergers detected during O1-O4a with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binary mergers, detected in gravitational waves since 2015, are candidate sources for astrophysical neutrinos in the GeV regime from proton-proton and proton-neutron collisions. This contribution presents the results of the search for such a signal using mergers detected during the fourth observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers. We use the dense infill array at the center of the IceCube detector, IceCube-DeepCore, to select neutrino candidates in the 0.5-5 GeV energy range. The search for a statistically significant excess associated with an astrophysical signal is performed in a $\pm$ 500 s window around the gravitational wave detection time. We do not observe any statistically significant excess in the neutrino data, and set upper limits on the neutrino emission from these objects. Additionally, we search for subpopulations of neutrino-emitting sources, including merger events detected in previous observing runs; no significant signal has been identified yet.
#### Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 years of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations detected stellar clumps around the z=1.4 gravitationally lensed Sparkler galaxy (of stellar mass $M_*\sim 10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$), with ages and metallicities compatible with globular clusters (GCs). However, most of their masses ($>10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) and sizes (>30 pc) are about 10 times those of GCs in the local Universe. To assess whether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of their dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of dynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied performing multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of mass $M_{200}\simeq 5\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (from the stellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved clumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the same halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like stellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass $>10^7\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly contributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass distribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive clumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from low-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of present-day GCs. When the surviving clumps are corrected for tidal stripping, their mass distribution peak shifts to $2\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, compatible with massive GCs. Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the Sparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might become bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster. The remaining clumps are too large in size to be progenitors of GCs.
#### XUE 10. The CO$_2$-rich terrestrial planet-forming region of an externally irradiated Herbig disk

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS gas molecular content of an externally irradiated Herbig disk, the F-type XUE 10 source, in the context of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program. XUE 10 belongs to the massive star cluster NGC 6357 (1.69 kpc), where it is exposed to an external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation $\approx$ 10$^3$ times stronger than in the Solar neighborhood. We modeled the molecular features in the mid-infrared spectrum with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 0D slab models. We derived basic parameters of the stellar host from a VLT FORS2 optical spectrum using PHOENIX stellar templates. We detect bright CO2 gas with the first simultaneous detection (> 5$\sigma$) of four isotopologues (12CO2, 13CO2, 16O12C18O, 16O12C17O) in a protoplanetary disk. We also detect faint CO emission (2$\sigma$) and the HI Pf$\alpha$ line (8$\sigma$). We also place strict upper limits on the water content, finding a total column density $\lesssim$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CO2 species trace low gas temperatures (300-370 K) with a range of column densities of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (16O12C17O)-1.3 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (12CO2) in an equivalent emitting radius of 1.15 au. The emission of 13CO2 is likely affected by line optical depth effects. 16O12C18O and 16O12C17O abundances may be isotopically anomalous compared to the 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios measured in the interstellar medium and the Solar System. We propose that the mid-infrared spectrum of XUE 10 is explained by H2O removal either via advection or strong photo-dissociation by stellar UV irradiation, and enhanced local CO2 gas-phase production. Outer disk truncation supports the observed CO2-H2O dichotomy. A CO2 vapor enrichment in 18O and 17O can be explained by means of external UV irradiation and early on (10$^{4-5}$ yr) delivery of isotopically anomalous water ice to the inner disk.
#### Reconnection-driven Flares in M87*: Proton-synchrotron Powered GeV Emission

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.
