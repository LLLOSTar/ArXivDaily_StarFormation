 - **Abstract**
 Tidally induced spin-up of stripped helium stars in short-period (<\,1\,d) binaries with black holes has been presented as one of the possible mechanisms to reproduce the high-spin tail of the black hole spin distribution derived from gravitational wave (GW) merger observations. At such short periods, a fraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be accreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be released as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray luminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium stars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries that merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for estimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black holes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive lower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped helium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 $Z_{\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large fraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also transfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities above $10^{35}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\sim10^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. Such binaries should be observable as X-ray bright systems at 0.1\,$Z_{\odot}$, 0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$, representative of Sextans A, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Solar neighbourhood, respectively. The formation efficiency of these systems increases with decreasing metallicity. However, accounting for the local star formation rates, our population synthesis predicts $\sim$2 and $\sim$1 such observable binaries in the Milky Way and LMC, respectively, that will produce a binary compact object merger within a Hubble time.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multi-telescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 8.25 events for type Ia, 3.06 for type Ic, 1.04 for type IIb, 0.66 for type IIL, 0.89 for type IIn, 5.26 for type IIP, and 1.44 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-Field Survey (WFS) program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 3.30 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.4\%$ precision in estimating the Hubble constant.

 - **Abstract**
 Reconstructing the dark matter density, velocity, and tidal (MTV) fields from galaxy surveys is essential for advancing our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we present a machine learning-based framework using a UNet convolutional neural network to reconstruct the MTV fields from mock samples of the DESI bright galaxy survey within the redshift range $0.1 < z < 0.4$. Our approach accounts for realistic observational effects, including geometric selection, flux-limited data, and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects, thereby improving the fidelity of the reconstructed fields. Testing on mock galaxy catalogs generated from the Jiutian N-body simulation, our method achieves significant accuracy level. The reconstructed density field exhibits strong consistency with the true field, effectively eliminating most RSD effects and achieving a cross-correlation power spectrum coefficient greater than 0.985 on scales with $k < 0.1 \, h \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The velocity field reconstruction accurately captures large-scale coherent flows and small-scale turbulent features, exhibiting slopes of the grid-to-grid relationship close to unity and a scatter below $\sim$100 $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, the tidal field is reconstructed without bias, successfully recovering the features of the large-scale cosmic web, including clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids. Our results confirm that the proposed framework effectively captures the large-scale distribution and dynamics of dark matter while addressing key systematic challenges. These advancements provide a reliable and robust tool for analyzing current and future galaxy surveys, paving the way for new insights into cosmic structure formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) contain crucial information about their origin and propagation through the interstellar medium. When GCRs reach Earth, they are significantly influenced by the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. This effect introduces time-dependent variations in GCR fluxes. The AMS-02 experiment has released time-dependent flux data for protons, electrons, and positrons, revealing clear correlations with solar modulation. Studies suggest that cosmic rays with the same charge, such as protons and helium nuclei, exhibit similar/same solar modulation parameters. In this work, we derive the LIS for protons and positrons under the assumption of a common solar modulation potential, using data from Voyager 1 and a 7-year average from AMS-02. Similarly, the LIS for antiprotons and electrons is derived by assuming they are governed by a separate solar modulation potential. We demonstrate that the time-dependent fluxes of positrons and protons can be accurately modeled using the same set of solar modulation parameters within a modified force-field approximation framework. Based on this, we predict the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons using the corresponding electron flux data.

 - **Abstract**
 The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but recent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these periodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments. A systematic study of filament oscillations over the solar cycle can shed light on the evolution of the prominences. Until now, only manual techniques have been used to analyze these oscillations. Aims. This work serves as a proof of concept, aiming to demonstrate the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks automatically detect filament oscillations by applying power-spectrum analysis to H$\alpha$ data from the GONG telescope network. Methods. The proposed technique studies periodic fluctuations of every pixel of the H$\alpha$ data cubes. Using the Lomb Scargle periodogram, we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the dataset. The background noise is well fitted to a combination of red and white noise. Using Bayesian statistics and Markov chains -- Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms we can fit the spectra and determine the confidence threshold of a given percentage to search for real oscillations. We built two CNN models to obtain the same results as the MCMC approach. Results. We applied the CNN models to some observations reported in the literature, proving its reliability in detecting the same events as the classical methods. A day with events not previously reported has been studied to check for the model capabilities outside of a controlled dataset where we can check with previous reports. Conclusions. CNNs proved to be a useful tool to study solar filament oscillations, using spectral techniques. Computing times have been reduced significantly while getting results similar enough to the classical methods. This is a relevant step towards the automatic detection of filament oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 The subsurface convective zones (CZs) of massive stars significantly influences many of their key characteristics. Previous studies have paid little attention to the impact of rotation on the subsurface convective zone (CZ), so we aim to investigate the evolution of this zone in rapidly rotating massive stars. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to simulate the subsurface CZs of massive stars during the main sequence phase. We establish stellar models with initial masses ranging from 5 $M_{\odot}$ to 120 $M_{\odot}$, incorporating four metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.006, 0.002, and 0.0001) and three rotational velocities ($\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0, $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.50, and $\mit\omega/\omega_{\text {crit}}$ = 0.75). We find that rapid rotation leads to an expansion of the subsurface CZ, increases convective velocities, and promotes the development of this zone. Additionally, subsurface CZs can also emerge in stars with lower metallicities. Comparing our models with observations of massive stars in the Galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, we find that rotating models better encompass the observed samples. Rotation significantly influences the evolution of the subsurface CZ in massive stars. By comparing with the observed microturbulence on the surfaces of OB stars, we propose that the subsurface CZs may be one of the sources of microturbulence.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.
#### Can supermassive stars form in protogalaxies due to internal Lyman-Werner feedback?

 - **Abstract**
 Population III stars are possible precursors to early massive and supermassive black holes (BHs). The presence of soft UV Lyman Werner (LW) background radiation can suppress Population III star formation in minihalos and allow them to form in pristine atomic cooling halos. In the absence of molecular hydrogen ($\rm H_2$) cooling, atomic-cooling halos enable rapid collapse with suppressed fragmentation. High background LW fluxes from preceding star-formation have been proposed to dissociate $\rm H_2$. This flux can be supplemented by LW radiation from one or more Population III star(s) in the same halo, reducing the necessary background level. Here we consider atomic-cooling halos in which multiple protostellar cores form close to one another nearly simultaneously. We assess whether the first star's LW radiation can dissociate nearby $\rm H_2$, enabling the prompt formation of a second, supermassive star (SMS) from warm, atomically-cooled gas. We use a set of hydrodynamical simulations with the code ENZO, with identical LW backgrounds centered on a halo with two adjacent collapsing gas clumps. When an additional large local LW flux is introduced, we observe immediate reductions in both the accretion rates and the stellar masses that form within these clumps. While the LW flux reduces the $\text{H}_2$ fraction and increases the gas temperature, the halo core's potential well is too shallow to promptly heat the gas to $\gtrsim$ 1000 K and increase the accretion rate onto the second protostar. We conclude that internal LW feedback inside atomic-cooling halos is unlikely to facilitate the formation of SMSs or massive BH seeds.
