 - **Abstract**
 The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is poised to revolutionize our scientific understanding of exoplanets, dark matter, dark energy, and general astrophysics, including through an innovative community approach to defining and executing sky surveys. The Roman Observations Time Allocation Committee (ROTAC) was convened to recommend time allocations for the three Core Community Surveys (CCS) using the Wide Field Instrument (WFI): the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, the High Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, as well as balance the time allocation for the General Astrophysics Surveys. Each CCS had a corresponding Definition Committee that collected community input and designed proposals for a nominal (in-guide) survey, as well as underguide and overguide options with smaller and larger time allocations, respectively. These options explored different ways of fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general astrophysics science goals enabled by the surveys. In this report, the ROTAC lays out its recommendations for the three CCS observing designs and the WFI time allotment for CCS (74.5%) and the General Astrophysics Surveys (25.5%).

 - **Abstract**
 Saturn's moon Titan undergoes a long annual cycle of 29.45 Earth years. Titan's northern winter and spring were investigated in detail by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft (2004-2017), but the northern summer season remains sparsely studied. Here we present new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Keck II telescope made in 2022 and 2023 during Titan's late northern summer. Using JWST's mid-infrared instrument, we spectroscopically detected the methyl radical, the primary product of methane break-up and key to the formation of ethane and heavier molecules. Using the near-infrared spectrograph onboard JWST, we detected several non-local thermodynamic equilibrium CO and CO2 emission bands, which allowed us to measure these species over a wide altitude range. Lastly, using the near-infrared camera onboard JWST and Keck II, we imaged northern hemisphere tropospheric clouds evolving in altitude, which provided new insights and constraints on seasonal convection patterns. These observations pave the way for new observations and modelling of Titan's climate and meteorology as it progresses through the northern fall equinox, when its atmosphere is expected to show notable seasonal changes.
#### Primordial black holes as dark matter candidates: Multi-frequency constraints from cosmic radiation backgrounds

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. This study investigates the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in shaping cosmic radiation backgrounds--the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), the Lyman-Werner background (LWB), and the cosmic radio background (CRB)--and evaluates their viability as dark matter (DM) candidates based on observational constraints and theoretical limits. Methods. PBH accretion is modelled using analytical frameworks that include electron advection-dominated accretion flows (eADAF), standard advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF), luminous hot accretion flows (LHAF), and thin disks. Emission from PBHs in both dark matter halos and the intergalactic medium (IGM) is computed. We assess the impact of variations in model assumptions, such as halo gas density profiles, gas velocities, and emission models. The results are compared with observational limits and theoretical thresholds to constrain the PBH fraction as DM for masses between 1 and 100 solar masses Results. PBHs may contribute up to 99, 93, 80, and 91 per cent of the unresolved soft X-ray background for masses of 1, 10, 33, and 100 solar masses, respectively, and about 33-39 per cent of the hard X-ray background. These contributions limit the PBH DM fraction to 7e-3, 6e-4, 6e-4, and 7e-4, respectively, in our baseline model. These constraints are consistent with those from the LWB, ensuring molecular cooling and early star formation are preserved. However, explaining the radio background excess and the EDGES signal would require PBH fractions well above these limits. For 1 solar mass, excluding ADAF subregimes relaxes the constraint to 3e-2, highlighting the sensitivity to accretion physics. Variations in model assumptions introduce only minor differences in the predicted backgrounds.
#### Spectral Biases, Starspot Morphology, and Dynamo Transitions on the Pre-Main Sequence: Insights from the X-Shooter WTTS Library

 - **Abstract**
 Starspots are ubiquitous in young, low mass stars, yet their impact on the spectral classification and fundamental parameter inference of pre main sequence stars has been largely overlooked. In this study, we demonstrate that cool starspots systematically distort spectral morphology and bias derived effective temperatures, surface gravities, and luminosities in non accreting Weak Lined T Tauri Stars (WTTS). Using a sample of 56 WTTS with high resolution, broad band X-Shooter spectra, we perform two temperature spectral fits that explicitly account for spot coverage and temperature contrast. These composite models consistently outperform traditional single temperature fits, particularly in the 3350 4000 K regime, where spot contributions dominate the red optical and near infrared flux. Moreover, we propose that surface gravity discrepancies between optical and infrared measurements are a natural consequence of spot dominated emission in PMS stars that is accentuated by observational uncertainty. We find that single temperature models can overestimate effective temperatures by up to 700 K and underestimate log g by 1-2 dex. Using spot-corrected effective temperatures, we derive masses and ages from traditional, magnetic, and spotted evolutionary models, finding that spot corrections systematically raise inferred masses by up to 80 percent and stellar ages by up to 0.5 dex. These discrepancies are strongest for stars in the 0.3 to 0.8 solar mass range. Using starspots as a proxy for magnetic topology, we find evidence that a shift from largely axisymmetric to non axisymmetric magnetic fields dominated by small scale structures coincides with the formation of a radiative core during the pre main sequence, effectively separating convective and interface dynamo regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols are common in exoplanet atmospheres, but their formation-whether through gas condensation or photochemical reactions-remains uncertain. We report a 6$\sigma$ detection of limb asymmetry in the transmission spectrum of WASP-94A b, revealing a cloud-covered (11$\sigma$) cooler morning limb and a clear hotter evening limb with strong H$_2$O absorption (10$\sigma$). Models suggest cloud droplets formed near mbar pressures are lofted to 0.01 mbar by strong vertical dynamics in the morning limb. They evaporate when circulated to the hotter evening limb, requiring a minimum 280 K (3$\sigma$) limb-to-limb temperature difference. We confirm that aerosols in hot Jupiters like WASP-94A b can have clouds cycling between day and night sides instead of photochemical hazes. Ignoring these effects severely biases inferred chemical abundances, showing limb-resolved spectroscopy is critical for characterizing the formation mechanisms of transiting exoplanets-from gas giants to terrestrial exoplanets, indicating the need to reassess inferences from a decade's worth of Hubble Space Telescope observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We report that the formation of the twin-bubble system N65 and N65bis may be caused by the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) from the Bullet Nebula. The blue-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component (N65a [47, 55] km s$^{-1}$) is associated with the twin-bubble system, while the red-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component (N65b [55, 62] km s$^{-1}$) is linked to the Bullet Nebula. The distinct signatures of CCC, such as the bridge feature, the U-shape cavity and the complementary distribution with displacement, are found between N65a and N65b. The collision timescale is estimated to be 1.15 to 2.0 Myr, which is consistent with the dynamical ages of the two \HII regions in N65a (0.73 Myr for N65bis and 1.19 Myr for N65, respectively), indicating their CCC-related origin. A total of 354 young stellar objects (YSOs) are founded, which are clustered into eight MST (Minimum Spinning Tree) groups. The distribution of M1 (at the post-frontal edge) and M2, M3, M4 (at the pre-frontal edge) suggests that the CCC triggers star formation along the collision path of $b=0^{\circ}.35$, with younger YSOs present at the pre-frontal edge. Therefore, the bipolar morphology of the twin-bubble system can be interpreted by the collision of N65a and N65b along $b=0^{\circ}.35$ about 2 Myr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent small-scale eruptions are fascinating phenomena in the solar atmosphere. However, their underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. On 2021 May 23, five recurrent jetlets (J1-J5) were observed continuously ejecting from a satellite spot located at the north edge of AR 12824. Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength data from NVST, SDO, and IRIS, we investigate the physical characteristics of these jetlets and their relationship with the satellite spot. The widths of these jetlets range from 1300 to 2900 km, their lifetimes range span 3 to 10 minutes, and their projection speeds vary from 152.8 to 406.0 km s$^{-1}$. During the eruptions, the satellite spot moved northwest at a low speed of 376 $\pm$ 12 m s$^{-1}$. Its area gradually decreased due to magnetic cancellation with surrounding positive magnetic field, resulting in an average cancellation rate of 1.3$\times$10$^{18}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$. Dark lanes that separated from the satellite spot and small pores were observed to move toward nearby these features or dark lanes with opposite polarities, eventually disappearing during the magnetic cancellation process. J4 was driven by an eruption of a micro-filament. Spectral observations revealed a redshift on the right side of J4 and a blueshift on the left side of its base, suggesting a counterclockwise rotation. The horizontal magnetic field of the satellite spot consistently exhibited a vortex structure throughout its evolution until it vanished. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation confirms that the satellite spot serves as one footpoint of a mini-flux rope. These observations reveal that these jetlets might result from three-dimensional null-point magnetic reconnection, initiated by the continuous eruption of a mini-flux-rope or multiple mini-flux-ropes, driven by sustained magnetic cancellation.

 - **Abstract**
 The so-called "Giant Arc" is a sparse pattern of MgII absorbers spanning approximately 740 comoving Mpc, whose discovery has been claimed to contradict the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions, and among equivalent halo samples in a cosmological simulation of the standard model. In a response, the original discoverers of the "Giant Arc" have argued that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational data, but that a smaller linking length should be used for control studies, in which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the magnetic reconnection during a flare by investigating flare ribbon dynamics using observations and data-constrained magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation. In particular, we estimate the reconnection flux and the reconnection flux rates using flare ribbons of an M1.1 flare hosted by the active region 12184 utilizing the technique developed by Qiu et al. (2002, ApJ, 565, 1335). The reconnection flux and corresponding flux rates are found to be 10^20 Mx and 10^18 Mx/s respectively. To understand the flare onset and the origin of flare ribbons, we perform an MHD simulation initiated by the non-force-free-field extrapolation. Importantly, the extrapolated configuration identifies a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic neutral point and a flux rope in the flaring region, which is crucial to the flaring activity. The reconnection initiates at the null point and, subsequently the flux rope rises and appears to reconnect there, which is favorable for the eruption of the filament. The surrounding field lines also seem to take part in the null point reconnection. In later stage, a current sheet is formed below the null point ensuing a secondary reconnection near an X-type topology, further contributing to the energy release process in the flare. We trace the footpoint evolution of the field lines lying over the flare ribbons and find a significant similarity between the observed flare ribbons and the evolution of footpoints computed from the MHD simulation. We estimated induced electric field during the flare and found it to be $\approx$ .52 V/cm, a slight less value, as per many past literatures. Additional findings are the enhancement of vertical current density near the flaring ribbons, a signature of successive reconnections near the null point. Overall, the present work contributes to the understanding of the ribbon formation in a flaring process and the involved magnetic reconnection.

 - **Abstract**
 The PRIMAger instrument on board the proposed PRIMA satellite will offer the unprecedented capability to obtain hundreds of square-degree maps in polarised emission at sub-arcminute resolution in four Far-IR bands. This will open a unique window to study magnetic fields in our Galaxy. PRIMAGAL, a proposed survey of polarized dust emission in the Milky Way Galactic Plane will determine the strength and orientation of magnetic fields towards several thousands of filamentary clouds in a wide range of linear masses, column densities, evolution, star-formation rates and efficiencies, and Galactic environment. This survey will address for the first time in a statistically significant fashion the role that magnetic fields play in shaping the formation, evolution and fragmentation of dense ISM filaments down to a minimum scale of 0.4 pc up to 8 kpc distance from the Sun. A 4-band polarization survey of the Galactic Plane with |b|<1° (a total of 720 sq. deg.) can be executed by PRIMAger in about 1200 hours including all mapping and instrument overhead.
#### Tracing the formation and migration history: molecular signatures in the atmosphere of misaligned hot Jupiter WASP-94Ab using JWST NIRSpec/G395H

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their host stars has long challenged traditional models of planetary formation and migration. Characterising their atmospheric composition - mainly in the form of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity - can provide insights into their formation locations and evolution pathways. With JWST we can characterise the atmospheres of these types of planets more precisely than previously possible, primarily because it allows us to determine both their atmospheric oxygen and carbon composition. Here, we present a JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum from 2.8-5.1$\mu m$ of WASP-94Ab, an inflated hot Jupiter with a retrograde misaligned orbit around its F-type host star. We find a relatively cloud-free atmosphere, with absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ at detection significances of $\sim 4\sigma$ and $\sim 11\sigma$, respectively. In addition, we detect tentative evidence of CO absorption at $\sim3\sigma$, as well as hints of sulphur with the detection of H$_2$S at a $\sim 2.5\sigma$ confidence level. Our favoured equilibrium chemistry model determines a C/O ratio of $0.49^{+0.08}_{-0.13}$ for WASP-94Ab's atmosphere, which is substellar compared to the star's C/O ratio of $0.68 \pm 0.10$. The retrieved atmospheric metallicity is similar to the star's metallicity as both are $\sim 2\times$ solar. We find that this sub-stellar C/O ratio and stellar metallicity can be best explained by pebble accretion or planetesimal accretion in combination with large-distance migration of the planet.
#### On the dark matter formation scenario of NGC 4147

 - **Abstract**
 We report results on the radial velocity dispersion profile built out to the outskirts of NGC 4147, a Milky Way globular cluster with detected strong tidal tails. The cluster was chosen to probe, from an observational point of view, recent simulations that suggest that rising velocity dispersion profiles at large distance from the clusters' centers would be seen in globular clusters without tidal tails. From GEMINI@GMOS spectra, centered in the infrared CaII triplet region, of selected stars located along the onset of NGC 4147's tidal tails, we measured their radial velocities and overall metallicities. The derived metallicities were used to ultimately assessing on the highly-ranked cluster candidates of 9 stars, located between ~ 7 and 33 pc from the cluster's center, suitable for testing the aforementioned simulations. We complemented the present radial velocities with others available in the literature for cluster's members, and built a cluster velocity dispersion profile which suggests a mostly flat or slightly rising profile at large distances from the cluster's center. This outcome confirms that kinematically hot outermost cluster's stars are seen in NGC 4147, which disproves the recent model predictions. Nevertheless, the mean velocity dispersion of the outermost cluster's stars agrees with NGC 4147 being formed in a 10^8-10^9Mo dwarf galaxy with a cored dark matter profile that later was accreted on to the Milky Way.
#### APE: An analytical protostellar environment to provide physical conditions to chemical models and synthetic observations

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical modeling and synthetic observations are powerful methods to interpret observations, both requiring a knowledge of the physical conditions. In this paper, we present the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code, which aims at making chemical simulations and synthetic observations accessible. APE contains a physical model of protostellar evolution (including the central object, the envelope, the protoplanetary disk and the outflow) as well as interfaces to publicly available codes to perform chemical simulations, radiative transfer calculations, and synthetic interferometry imaging. APE produces density and temperature maps of protostellar systems. The code can also follow individual particles throughout their journey in a collapsing core. APE includes a treatment of the dust grain size-distribution to compute opacities self-consistently for subsequent radiative transfer. We show an example of application of APE by computing chemical abundance maps of CO, CN, CS, H2CO, and CH3OH in a Class I protostellar system. We also performed synthetic ALMA observations of their molecular emission assuming an edge-on source inclination. The moment 0 maps of CO, CS, and H2CO display an X-shaped emission similar to what is observed toward the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247.
