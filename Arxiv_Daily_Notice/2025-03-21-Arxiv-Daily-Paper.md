 - **Abstract**
 We present an updated collection of eclipsing and ellipsoidal binary systems in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), as observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. The catalog comprises a total of 75 400 binary systems, including 63 252 in the LMC and 12 148 in the SMC. The sample is categorized into 67 971 eclipsing and 7429 ellipsoidal variables. For all stars, we provide I-band and V-band photometric time series collected between 2010 and 2024 during the fourth phase of the OGLE project (OGLE-IV). We discuss methods used to identify binary systems in the OGLE data and present objects of particular interest, including double periodic variables, transient eclipsing binaries, double eclipsing binaries, and binary systems with pulsating stars. We present a comparative analysis based on the most comprehensive catalogs of variable stars in the Magellanic System, compiled from surveys like Gaia, ASAS-SN, and EROS-2, and included in the International Variable Star Index.

 - **Abstract**
 Various past theoretical considerations and observational efforts suggest the presence of a population of stellar-mass black holes in the innermost parsec of the Galactic centre. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of these black holes on the composition of the embedding stellar population through their direct collisions with the individual stars. Based on the estimated collision rates, we derive an order of magnitude radial density profile of the black hole cluster. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering various possible formation channels for the black holes and the observed present-day properties of the stellar populations in the Galactic centre. We find that the collisions of the stars and the black holes can lead to the depletion of the most massive stars within the S-cluster on a timescale of a few million years. The necessary black hole cluster density is compatible with the recurrent in situ star formation in the innermost parsec of the Galactic centre. We suggest that such a depletion naturally explains the reported lack of stars of the stellar type O and of the Galactic halo hyper-velocity star counterparts within the S-cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 RY Scuti, thought to be a Wolf-Rayet (WR) progenitor, is a massive, post-main-sequence, binary star system undergoing Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). SOFIA (+FORCAST) spectroscopy of the inner, ionized region of RY Scuti's double ringed toroidal nebula affirms the previous detection of the well-studied 12.81 $\mu$m Ne II forbidden transition and reveals four distinct emission lines, including three previously undetected transitions, S III, Fe III, and S III. Cloudy photoionization modeling of the four neon, sulfur, and iron lines was performed to derive fractional abundances (log($\frac{X}{H}$)) of neon at -3.19 $\pm$ 0.0251, sulfur at -3.76 $\pm$ 0.0487, and iron at -2.23 $\pm$ 0.0286. All three species are overabundant with respect to fiducial solar chemical abundances, especially iron. Our analysis suggests that the outer envelope of the primary star in the RY Scuti system is being stripped away via RLOF, leaving helium-rich and hydrogen-poor material visible to observation. This material also exhibits elevated neon, sulfur, and iron fractional abundances, consistent with RY Scuti evolving toward a WR object.

 - **Abstract**
 Secondary eclipse observations of exoplanets at near-infrared wavelengths enable the detection of thermal emission and reflected stellar light, providing insights into the thermal structure and aerosol composition of their atmospheres. These properties are intertwined, as aerosols influence the energy budget of the planet. WASP-80 b is a warm gas giant with an equilibrium temperature of 825 K orbiting a bright late-K/early-M dwarf, and for which the presence of aerosols in its atmosphere have been suggested from previous HST and Spitzer observations. We present an eclipse spectrum of WASP-80 b obtained with JWST NIRISS/SOSS, spanning 0.68 to 2.83 $\mu$m, which includes the first eclipse measurements below 1.1 $\mu$m for this exoplanet, extending our ability to probe light reflected by its atmosphere. When a reflected light geometric albedo is included in the atmospheric retrieval, our eclipse spectrum is best explained by a reflected light contribution of $\sim$30 ppm at short wavelengths, although further observations are needed to statistically confirm this preference. We measure a dayside brightness temperature of $T_{\rm B}=811_{-70}^{+69}$ K and constrain the reflected light geometric albedo across the SOSS wavelength range to $A_{\rm g}=0.204_{-0.056}^{+0.051}$, allowing us to estimate a 1-$\sigma$ range for the Bond albedo of $0.148\lesssim A_{\rm B}\lesssim0.383$. By comparing our spectrum with aerosol models, we find that manganese sulfide and silicate clouds are disfavored, while cloud species with weak-to-moderate near-infrared reflectance, along with soots or low formation-rate tholin hazes, are consistent with our eclipse spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) have remained a mystery in astronomy since their discovery over a century ago. The only currently known carrier is C$_{60}^+$ responsible for five DIBs, while more than 550 are yet to be interpreted. The spectra of short carbon chain cations C$_n^+$, which are considered one of the most promising classes of species for the role of carriers of DIBs, are successfully recorded using He-tagging spectroscopy. The comparison of laboratory spectra with the observations demonstrates a close match of two absorption bands of C$_4^+$ with the broad DIB at 503.9 nm. This defines a high abundance of these ions in the interstellar medium (ISM), which should exceed those of other similar-sized carbon chain cations. It is anticipated that all other short carbon chain cations will exhibit linear geometry and, as a consequence, will have a long vibrational progression. However, the distinctive cyclic geometry of C$_4^+$ is postulated to underpin the elevated abundance of these ions in the ISM, as well as the distinctive spectrum of this ion, which displays a single strong, relatively narrow absorption band that exceeds in intensity all other absorption bands in the visible range.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from VLT/UVES spectra and TESS photometric observations of the pulsating EL CVn binary WASP 1021-28, containing a He-core white dwarf precursor (pre-He WD). Double-lined radial velocities were measured with the atmospheric parameters of $T_{\rm eff,A}$ = 7411$\pm40$ K, [M/H] = 0.34$\pm$0.05 dex, and $v_{\rm A}$$\sin i$ = 86.6$\pm$4.0 km s$^{-1}$ for the more massive primary. Combining these measurements and TESS data from four sectors allowed the direct calculation of accurate values for the absolute parameters of each component and the distance to the system. The third-light source of $l_3$ = 0.029 may be the outer tertiary object previously discovered by SPHERE/IRDIS observations. WASP 1021-28 A is located near the blue edge of the $\gamma$ Dor instability strip, and the less massive companion is concurrent with the He-core WD model for metallicity $Z$ = 0.02 and mass $M$ = 0.191 $M_\odot$. The $Z$ value and the Galactic kinematics demonstrate that the program target belongs to the thin-disk population. We iteratively prewhitened the entire TESS residuals and extracted four and nine significant signals in two ranges of 1.12$-$2.25 day$^{-1}$ and 111.25$-$139.24 day$^{-1}$, respectively. A signal of $f_2$ = 1.31865 day$^{-1}$ in the low-frequency region can be attributed to the $\gamma$ Dor pulsation of WASP 1021-28 A, and the high frequencies may be extremely low-mass pre-He WD oscillations. The results presented here provide valuable information on the evolution of short-period EL CVn stars proposed as inner binaries of hierarchical triple systems and the multiperiodic pulsations.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The interaction between the relativistic jet and the circumburst medium produces a multiwavelength afterglow through synchrotron radiation. In this work, we present multiwavelength properties of GRB~250101A based on the observations of Swift, Fermi, and Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto). The spectral analysis of Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM reveals a soft prompt spectrum with a low-energy photon index of $-1.18$ and a peak energy of 33 keV, and the isotropic energy is $1.4\times10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. The prompt emission of GRB 250101A aligns with Type II GRBs in the Amati relation. Meanwhile, our analysis indicates that GRB 250101A is an X-ray-rich or X-ray-dominated GRB, with intrinsic properties suggesting that it is relatively softer than most classical GRBs. Optical observation with Mephisto, beginning 197 s post-trigger, shows a single power-law decay in $uvgriz$ bands, with $F_{\nu,\mathrm{obs}} \propto t^{-0.76} \nu^{-1.20}$. The observed spectral index significantly exceeds theoretical predictions under standard afterglow models, suggesting a color excess of $\sim0.21$ mag. However, combining X-ray and optical afterglow, we find that GRB 250101A is more likely a ``normal burst'' rather than an ``optical-dark burst'', and the dust extinction effect plays an important role in the optical blue bands. Furthermore, there is a structural change at $T_0+2924$ s in the optical light curve, indicating a density drop of $\sim50$ \% in the interstellar medium at a distance of $\sim0.05~{\rm pc}$.

 - **Abstract**
 To deepen our understanding of optical astronomy, we must advance imaging technology to overcome conventional frame-based cameras' limited dynamic range and temporal resolution. Our Perspective paper examines how neuromorphic cameras can effectively address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from the human retina, neuromorphic cameras excel in speed and high dynamic range by utilizing asynchronous pixel operation and logarithmic photocurrent conversion, making them highly effective for celestial imaging. We use 1300 mm terrestrial telescope to demonstrate the neuromorphic camera's ability to simultaneously capture faint and bright celestial sources while preventing saturation effects. We illustrate its photometric capabilities through aperture photometry of a star field with faint stars. Detection of the faint gas cloud structure of the Trapezium cluster during a full moon night highlights the camera's high dynamic range, effectively mitigating static glare from lunar illumination. Our investigations also include detecting meteorite passing near the Moon and Earth, as well as imaging satellites and anthropogenic debris with exceptionally high temporal resolution using a 200mm telescope. Our observations show the immense potential of neuromorphic cameras in advancing astronomical optical imaging and pushing the boundaries of observational astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Kepler and TESS space missions have revealed the rich gravity (g-)mode pulsation spectra of many hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars in detail. These spectra exhibit complex behaviors, with some stars exhibiting trapped modes interposing in the asymptotic period sequences of regular period spacing, while others do not. Methods. We used our STELlar modeling from the Universite de Montreal (STELUM) code to compute static (parametric) and evolutionary models of sdB stars, with different prescriptions for their chemical and thermal structures. We used our adiabatic PULSE code to compute the theoretical spectra of g-mode pulsations for degrees of l=1 to 4 and for periods between 1000 s and 15 000 s, amply covering the range of observed g-modes in these stars. Results. We show that g-mode pulsation spectra and, in particular, the appearance of trapped modes are highly dependent on the chemical and thermal structures in the models as the star evolves, particularly in the region just above the He-burning core. Depending on the prescriptions and specific evolutionary stage, we observe mainly three types of spectra for mid to high radial-order g-modes (the ones observed in sdB stars): flat spectra of nearly constant period spacing; spectra with deep minima of the period spacing interposing between modes with more regular spacing (which correspond to trapped modes); and spectra showing a wavy pattern in period spacing. For the two latter cases, we have identified the region where the modes are trapped in the star. Conclusions. Detailed comparisons with observed g-mode spectra ought to be carried out next to progress on this issue and constrain the internal structure of core-He burning stars via asteroseismology, in particular, for the region above the He-burning core.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the spatial distribution and physical characteristics of molecular clouds in the G24 region, which is located near the intersection of the Milky Way's Galactic bar with the Norma arm and the 3 kpc arm. Utilizing molecular line data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, along with our own observations of HCO$^{+}$ line using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7 m telescope, we have revealed the complex architecture of molecular clouds in the G24 region. Seven giant molecular clouds, each with a mass exceeding $10^4$ $M_\odot$ and a typical H$_2$ column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, have been identified through observations of CO and its isotopes. The conversion factor $X_{\text{CO}}$ for the G24 region is estimated to be 8.25 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$, aligning with the typical values observed in other regions. Adopting the GaussClumps algorithm, we have identified a total of 257, 201, and 110 clumps in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O within G24 region, respectively. The derived physical properties (including effective radius, mass, and virial parameter) indicate that the majority of these clumps are gravitationally bound, with a subset possessing the potential to form massive stars. Examination of gas infall activities within these clumps further suggests ongoing massive star formation. The complex physical and kinematic environment, shaped by the G24 region's unique location within the Milky Way, has limited the clear detection of gas outflows.

 - **Abstract**
 To identify member populations of IC 1396, we employ the random forest (RF) classifier of machine learning technique. Random forest classifier is an ensemble of individual decision trees suitable for large, high-dimensional datasets. The training set used in this work is derived from previous Gaia-based studies, where the member stars are younger than $\sim$ 10~Myr. However, its sensitivity is limited to $\sim$ 20~mag in the $\rm r_2$ band, making it challenging to identify candidates at the fainter end. In this analysis, in addition to magnitudes and colours, we incorporate several derived parameters from the magnitude and colour of the sources to identify candidate members of the star-forming complex. By employing this method, we are able to identify promising candidate member populations of the star-forming complex. We discuss the associated limitations and caveats in the method and for improvment in future studies. In this analysis, we identify 2425 high-probability low-mass stars distributed within the entire star-forming complex, of which 1331 are new detections. Comparison of these identified member populations shows a high retrieval rate with Gaia-based literature sources, as well as sources detected through methods based on optical spectroscopy, Spitzer, $\rm H_{\alpha}/X-ray$ emissions, optical, and 2MASS photometry. The mean age of the member populations is $\rm \sim 2-4~Myr$, consistent with findings from previous studies. Considering the identified member populations, we present preliminary results by exploring the presence of sub-clusters within IC 1396, assessing the possible mass limit of the member populations, and providing a brief discussion on the star formation history of the complex.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations indicate that stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae are often surrounded by dense circumstellar material (CSM). Motivated by this, we develop an analytic model to systematically study the dynamics of long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) jet propagation in various CSM environments. We derive a general formula for the jet head velocity ($\beta_{\rm h}$) and breakout time ($t_{\rm b}$) valid across Newtonian, relativistic, and intermediate regimes, accounting for a previously unrecognized dependence on $1 - \beta_{\rm h}$. Our results highlight a fundamental distinction between jet propagation in massive stars, where $\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$, and in extended CSM, where $1-\beta_{\rm h}\ll 1$. We establish an analytic success/failure criterion for jets and express it in terms of jet and CSM parameters, revealing a strong dependence on CSM radius. To quantify the relativistic nature of the jet-cocoon system, we introduce the energy-weighted proper velocity $\overline{\Gamma\beta}$. We identify three possible jet outcomes-(a) successful jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 10-100$), (b) barely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 1$), and (c) completely failed jets ($\overline{\Gamma\beta} \sim 0.1$)-and constrain their respective jet/CSM parameter spaces. We show that in (b) and (c), large CSM radii can power luminous fast blue optical transients via cocoon cooling emission. This theoretical framework provides a basis for future observational and theoretical studies to elucidate the link between LGRBs, intermediate GRBs, low-luminosity LGRBs, and their environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave signature from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is dominated by quadrupolar oscillation modes of the newly born proto-neutron star (PNS), and could be detectable at galactic distances. We have developed a framework for computing the normal oscillation modes of a PNS in general relativity, including, for the first time, the presence of an accretion flow and a surrounding stalled accretion shock. These new ingredients are key to understand PNS oscillation modes, in particular those related to the standing-accretion-shock instability (SASI). Their incorporation is an important step towards accurate PNS asteroseismology. For this purpose, we perform linear and adiabatic perturbations of a spherically symmetric background, in the relativistic Cowling approximation, and cast the resulting equations as an eigenvalue problem. We discretize the eigenvalue problem using collocation Chebyshev spectral methods, which is then solved by means of standard and efficient linear algebra methods. We impose boundary conditions at the accretion shock compatible with the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. We present several numerical examples to assess the accuracy and convergence of the numerical code, as well as to understand the effect of an accretion flow on the oscillation modes, as a stepping stone towards a complete analysis of the CCSNe case.
#### Protoplanetary cores drove chondrule formation

 - **Abstract**
 Chondrules are small spherical objects that formed at high temperatures early in the history of the Solar System. The key compositional characteristics of chondrules may be well explained by high gas pressures in their formation environment (Galy et al. 2000; Alexander et al. 2008). However, such high gas pressures are widely considered astrophysically unreasonable (Ebel et al. 2023). Here, we propose that chondrules were formed via the processing of dust grains in the dust-rich envelopes of planetary embryos, before getting ejected via convective diffusion. We show that this scenario can explain many salient constraints on chondrule formation, including formation locations; mass and timescale of chondrule production; repeat chondrule heating events; heating timescales; and, most crucially, high prevailing gas pressures. Our work suggests that high gas pressures may indeed have prevailed during the formation of chondrules, reconciling previous analytical observations, experimental evidence, and theory. We suggest that chondrules are mostly the products rather than the precursors of planetary embryo formation - a result which would have important implications for our understanding of the early history of the Solar System.
