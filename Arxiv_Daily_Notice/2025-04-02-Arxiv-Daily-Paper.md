 - **Abstract**
 The dense cores of globular clusters (GCs) are efficient environments for the production of exotic stellar populations, including millisecond pulsars (MSPs), low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and cataclysmic variables (CVs). Most of these objects likely form through two- and three-body interactions and are useful tracers of the cluster's dynamical evolution. In this work we explore the exotic object population in the galactic GC NGC 362, searching for the optical counterpart of 33 X-ray sources identified within 1 arcmin from the cluster center. To this aim, we exploit a large Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data-set, obtained in eight different epochs and covering a wavelength range from near UV to the optical I band. To identify the most promising counterparts we follow a multi-step analysis, which is based on four main ingredients, namely positional coincidence, position in the colour-magnitude-diagrams (CMDs), H$\alpha$ excess and photometric variability. In addition, we complement the photometric analysis with spectroscopic information coming from the analysis of MUSE radial velocity (RV) curves. Thanks to this multi-diagnostic approach, we are able to identify 28 high-confidence optical counterparts, including several candidate MSPs, active binaries (ABs) and CVs. The most intriguing counterparts include a candidate black widow (BW) system, an eclipsing binary blue straggler, and a system in outburst, potentially representing either a LMXB or a nova eruption from a CV. The candidate MSPs proposed in this work will contribute to ongoing radio analyses with MeerKAT for the identification and detailed study of MSPs in NGC 362.

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium within $\rm\approx 15 \; pc$ of the Sun consists of a complex of fifteen diffuse, partially ionized clouds. Located within the Local Bubble, these clouds, known as the Cluster of Local Interstellar Clouds (CLIC), constitute the interstellar environment impinging upon our heliosphere. While each individual cloud can be modeled with a distinct velocity vector, the complex demonstrates a coherent bulk motion suggestive of a common origin. Here we examine two theories for the origin of the CLIC: that it formed due to an ionization front associated with nearby Strömgren spheres and/or due to a nearby supernova explosion that occurred within the pre-evacuated cavity of the Local Bubble. Tracing back the trajectory of the clouds, we disfavor a purely Strömgren sphere origin, given the CLIC's position interior to the surface of the most significant nearby Stromgren sphere and its motion transverse to the sphere's trajectory. Turning to a supernova origin, we model the formation of the CLIC assuming individual clouds have been swept up over time due to the expansion of a supernova remnant in its pressure-driven snowplow phase. We find that the 3D spatial-dynamical properties of the CLIC can be explained by the most recent supernova that exploded in the nearby Upper Centaurus Lupus cluster $\approx \rm 1.2 \; Myr$ ago and propagated into an ambient density of $n \approx 0.04 \;\rm cm^{-3}$. Our model predicts that the formation of the individual CLIC clouds occurred progressively over the past $1 \; \rm Myr$ and offers a natural explanation for the observed distribution, column density, temperature, and magnetic field structure of the complex.
#### The MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data release 3: Cold atomic gas associated with the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a blind search for Galactic HI 21-cm absorption lines toward 19130 radio sources, using 390 pointings of MALS, each pointing centered on a source brighter than 200 mJy. We detected 3640 HI absorption features. This represents the largest Galactic HI absorption line catalog to date. Based on the strong correlation between the HI 21-cm emission line column densities ($N_{HI}$) and the visual extinction ($A_V$) measured toward the pointing center, along with the confinement of the absorption features to a narrow range in radial velocities (-25$<v_{\rm LSR}$[kms$^{-1}$]$<$+25), we infer that the detected absorption lines form a homogeneous sample of HI clouds in the local interstellar medium (LISM). The HI 21-cm absorption optical depth is linearly correlated to $N_{HI}$ and $A_V$, up to $A_V$ of about 1 mag. Above this threshold, $A_V$ traces the total hydrogen content, and consequently, $A_V$ and $N_{HI}$ scale, differently. The slopes of $N_{HI}$ distributions of central sight lines with HI 21-cm absorption detections and non-detection differ at $>2\sigma$. A similar difference is observed for H$_2$ detections and non-detections in damped Lyman-alpha systems at $z$ > 1.8, implying that turbulence-driven WNM-to-CNM conversion is the common governing factor for the presence of HI 21-cm and H$_2$ absorption. Through a comparison of central and off-axis absorption features, we find that the slope of rms fluctuations in the optical depth variations in the quiescent gas associated with LISM is shallower than the earlier measurements in the disk. The densities (20-30 cm$^{-3}$) inferred from the optical depth variations are typical of the CNM values. The negligible velocity shifts between central and off-axis absorbers are in line with the hypothesis that the CNM and LNM clouds freeze out of the extended WNM phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations indicate that optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) at radii of $10^{14}-10^{15}$ cm around core-collapse supernovae (SN) progenitors is common. The breakout of the SN radiation-mediated shock (RMS) through such CSM leads to the formation of a collisionless shock (CLS). We analyze the evolution of the shock structure and associated radiation field during and after the RMS-CLS transition for non-relativistic breakouts (breakout shock velocity $v_{\rm bo}=10^9v_9~{\rm cm/s}<0.1c$) through a hydrogen-rich CSM "wind" density profile, $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, with breakout radius $R_{\rm bo}=10^{14}R_{14}$ cm much larger than the progenitor radius. An analytic description of the key properties of the emitted optical to X-ray radiation is provided, supported by numeric radiation-hydrodynamics calculations that self-consistently describe the time-dependent spatial distribution of the plasma and radiation, governed by the interplay between Bremsstrahlung emission/absorption and inelastic Compton scattering. We show that the characteristic energy of the photons carrying most of the luminosity, $\approx10^{43}R_{14}v_9^2$ erg/s, shifts from UV to X-ray, reaching 1 keV as the shock reaches $\approx3R_{\rm bo}$. The X-ray signal is not suppressed by propagation through the upstream wind, and its absence may suggest that the dense CSM does not extend much beyond $R_{\rm bo}$. Our results provide the basis for a quantitative calculation of the high energy $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission that is expected from particles accelerated at the CLS, and will allow using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young SNe, particularly ULTRASAT, to infer the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population.

 - **Abstract**
 Jupiter's gravity field observed by NASA's Juno spacecraft indicates that the density in the 10--100 GPa region is lower than one would expect from a H/He adiabat with 0.5-5x solar water abundance as has been observationally inferred in Jupiter's atmosphere, supported by the 2--4$\times$ solar enrichment in the heavy noble gases and other volatiles observed by the Galileo entry probe. Here, we assume that Jupiter's envelope harbors a radiative window at ~0.975-0.99 RJ. This outer stable layer (OSL) delays particle exchange and accelerates the cooling of the deep interior. Consequently, the He-depletion at the Mbar-level where H/He phase separation occurs would be stronger than seen in the atmosphere. We find that the inverted He-gradient across the OSL leads to atmospheric heavy element abundances that are up to dZatm=0.03 (+2x solar) higher than for adiabatic models. With an additional inverted Z-gradient, Zatm up to 3x solar is possible. Models with 1x solar Zatm have a dilute core confined to the inner 0.2-0.3 MJ (0.4-0.5 RJ), smaller than in adiabatic models. Models with 3x solar Zatm have a largely homogeneous-Z interior at 1x solar. The low observed atmospheric Ne/He ratio suggests that Ne is transported through the OSL as efficiently as He is and at an enhanced diffusivity as is characteristic of double diffusive convection. Better knowledge of the H/He-EOS in the 10--100 GPa region and of the H/He phase diagram is needed to understand Jupiter's interior structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Transmission spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insight into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum contains contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, which can differ in temperature, composition and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. While high-resolution ground-based observations have identified limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot/hot exoplanets, space-based studies of limb asymmetry are still in their early stages. The prevalence of limb asymmetry across a broad range of exoplanets remains largely unexplored. We conduct a comparative analysis of retrievals on transmission spectra, including traditional 1D approaches and four 2D models that account for limb asymmetry. Two of these 2D models include our newly proposed dynamical constraints derived from shallow-water simulations to provide physically-motivated temperature differences between limbs. Our analysis of WASP-39 b using JWST observations and previous combined datasets (HST, VLT, and Spitzer) strongly favors 2D retrievals over traditional 1D approaches, confirming significant limb asymmetry in this hot Jupiter. Within our 2D framework, unconstrained models recover larger temperature contrasts than dynamically-constrained models, with improved fits to specific spectral features, although Bayesian evidence cannot definitively distinguish between these 2D approaches. Our results support the presence of homogeneous C/O in both the morning and evening atmospheres, but with temperature differences leading to variations in clouds and hazes. Using this treatment, we can study a larger sample of hot Jupiters to gain insights into atmospheric limb asymmetries on these planets.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymmetric and narrow infalling structures, often called streamers, have been observed in several Class 0/I protostars, which is not expected in the classical star formation picture. Their origin and impact on the disk formation remain observationally unclear. By combining data from the James Cleark Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we investigate the physical properties of the streamers and parental dense core in the Class 0 protostar, IRAS 16544$-$1604. Three prominent streamers associated to the disk with lengths between 2800 to 5800 au, are identified on the northern side of the protostar in the C$^{18}$O emission. Their mass and mass infalling rates are estimated to be in the range of (1-4)$\times$10$^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ and (1-5)$\times$10$^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Infall signatures are also observed in the more diffuse extended protostellar envelope observed with the ALMA from the comparison to the infalling and rotating envelope model. The parental dense core detected by the JCMT observation has a mass of $\sim$0.5 $M_\odot$, sub to transonic turbulence of $\mathcal{M}$ $=$ 0.8-1.1, and a mass-to-flux ratio of 2-6. Our results show that the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 only possess 2% of the entire dense core mass and contribute less than 10% of the mass infalling rate of the protostellar envelope. Therefore, the streamers in IRAS 16544-1604 play a minor role in the mass accretion process onto the disk, in contrast to those streamers observed in other sources and those formed in numerical simulations of collapsing dense cores with similar turbulence and magnetic field strengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy morphology classification plays a crucial role in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. With galaxy observation data growing exponentially, machine learning has become a core technology for this classification task. However, traditional machine learning methods predominantly rely on supervised learning frameworks, and their dependence on large of labeled samples limits practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN, designed to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited labeled data. This model integrates semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN) with Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), establishing a multi-task learning framework. Within this framework, the discriminator and classifier are designed independently while sharing part of the architecture. By collaborating with the generator, the model significantly enhances both classification performance and sample generation capabilities, while also improving convergence and stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, GC-SWGAN achieves comparable or even superior classification accuracy (exceeding 75%) using only one-fifth of the labeled samples typically required by conventional fully supervised methods. Under identical labeled conditions, the model displays excellent generalization performance, attaining approximately 84% classification accuracy. Notably, in extreme scenarios where only 10\% of the data is labeled, GC-SWGAN still achieves high classification accuracy (over 68%), fully demonstrating its stability and effectiveness in low-labeled data environments. Furthermore, galaxy images generated by GC-SWGAN are visually similar to real samples.

 - **Abstract**
 The first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III), played a crucial role in the early Universe through their unique formation environment and metal-free composition. These stars can undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) due to fast rotation, becoming more compact and hotter/bluer than their (commonly assumed) non-rotating counterparts. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pop III CHE on the 21-cm signal and cosmic reionization under various assumptions on Pop III star formation, such as their formation efficiency, initial mass function, and transition to metal-enriched star formation. We combine stellar spectra computed by detailed atmosphere models with semi-numerical simulations of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization ($z\sim 6-30$). The key effect of CHE arises from the boosted ionizing power of Pop III stars, which reduces the Pop III stellar mass density required to reproduce the observed Thomson scattering optical depth by a factor of $\sim 2$. Meanwhile, the maximum 21-cm global absorption signal is shallower by up to $\sim 15$ mK (11%), partly due to the reduced Lyman-band emission from CHE, and the large-scale ($k\sim 0.2\ \rm cMpc^{-1}$) power drops by a factor of a few at $z\gtrsim 25$. In general, the effects of CHE are comparable to those of Pop III star formation parameters, showing an interesting interplay with distinct features in different epochs. These results highlight the importance of metal-free/poor stellar evolution in understanding the early Universe and suggest that future studies should consider joint constraints on the physics of star/galaxy formation and stellar evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 White-light observations from the WISPR instrument on NASA's Parker Solar Probe recently revealed the presence of a narrow, dense dust trail close to the orbit of asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Although Geminid-related, it aligns imperfectly with Phaethon's orbit and known Geminid meteoroid orbits. To address the nature of this dust trail, we performed a detailed comparison between the WISPR trail observations and several well-developed Geminid models. Simulating these models in the WISPR field of view visually demonstrates that the WISPR trail almost certainly represents the true ``density core'' of the Geminid stream. Trends in model trail width and offset from Phaethon's orbit, both as functions of true anomaly, agree with observations to varying extents. All the models, however, place their apparent core interior to the parent orbit due to Poynting-Robertson forces, contradictory to the WISPR trail which is exterior to Phaethon's orbit. Therefore, Phaethon's current orbit likely does not represent the orbit of the system parent, which most probably had a larger semi-major axis. These findings provide new initial conditions for future Geminid models, with WISPR identifying the Geminid core's position.

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the shock speed and source height of coronal shock waves using Type II solar radio bursts. The solar radio burst data from January 2022 to October 2023 were obtained from eCALLISTO archive. The type II radio bursts were isolated from the spectra through a rigorous noise reduction process by taking the maximum intensity of each time channel. Using plasma oscillations and electron density models for the solar corona, explicit expressions for shock speed and source height were obtained. From the dynamic spectra, the starting frequency of a burst was obtained and using these parameters shock speed and source height were calculated. Results confirmed shock speeds ranging from 343 to 1032 kms$^{-1}$ with average speed of 650$\pm$226 kms$^{-1}$ and source heights 1.317-1.724 R$_\odot$, with high precision in formula predictions. The study highlights the need for broader burst type inclusion in future research and underscores the efficacy of the developed methodologies to improve space weather forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the solar wind ions by the SPAN-I instruments on board the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft at solar perihelia (Encounters) 4 and closer find ample evidence of complex anisotropic non-Maxwellian velocity distributions that consist of core, beam, and `hammerhead' (i.e., anisotropic beam) populations. The proton core populations are anisotropic, with T_perp/T||>1, and the beams have super-Alfvenic speed relative to the core (we provide an example from Encounter 17). The alpha-particle population show similar features as the protons. These unstable VDFs are associated with enhanced, right-hand (RH) and left-hand (LH) polarized ion-scale kinetic wave activity, detected by the FIELDS instrument. Motivated by PSP observations, we employ nonlinear hybrid models to investigate the evolution of the anisotropic hot-beam VDFs and model the growth and the nonlinear stage of ion kinetic instabilities in several linearly unstable cases. The models are initialized with ion VDFs motivated by the observational parameters. We find rapidly growing (in terms of proton gyroperiods) combined ion-cyclotron (IC) and magnetosonic (MS) instabilities, which produce LH and RH ion-scale wave spectra, respectively. The modeled ion VDFs in the nonlinear stage of the evolution are qualitatively in agreement with PSP observations of the anisotropic core and `hammerhead' velocity distributions, quantifying the effect of the ion kinetic instabilities on wind plasma heating close to the Sun. We conclude that the wave-particle interactions play an important role in the energy transfer between the magnetic energy (waves) and random particle motion leading to anisotropic solar wind plasma heating.
#### XUE. Thermochemical Modeling Suggests a Compact and Gas-Depleted Structure for a Distant, Irradiated Protoplanetary Disk

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the physical structure of protoplanetary disk is crucial for interpreting the diversity of the exoplanet population. Until recently, the census of the physical properties of protoplanetary disks probed by mid-infrared observations was limited to the solar neighborhood ($d \lesssim 250$ pc); however, nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) such as Taurus -- where no O-type stars reside -- are not representative of the environments where the majority of the planet formation occurs in the Galaxy. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now enables observations of disks in distant high-mass SFRs, where strong external Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is expected to impact those disks. Nevertheless, a detailed characterization of externally irradiated disks is still lacking. We use the thermochemical code ProDiMo to model JWST/MIRI spectroscopy and archival visual/near-infrared photometry aiming to constrain the physical structure of the irradiated disk around the solar-mass star XUE 1 in NGC 6357 ($d \approx 1690$ pc). Our findings are: (1) Mid-infrared dust emission features are explained by amorphous and crystalline silicates with compositions similar to nearby disks. (2) The molecular features detected with MIRI originate within the first $\sim 1$ au, consistent with slab models' results. (3) Our model favors a disk truncated at $10$ au with a gas-to-dust ratio of unity in the outskirts. (4) Comparing models of the same disk structure under different irradiation levels, we find that strong external irradiation raises gas temperature tenfold and boosts water abundance beyond $10$ au by a factor of $100$. Our findings suggest the inner disk resists external irradiation, retaining the elements necessary for planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are often invoked as playing a primary role in star formation and in the formation of high-mass stars. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of high-mass cores using the 3-dimensional smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) code PHANTOM. We follow the collapse of six molecular clouds of mass 1000 M$_{\odot}$, four of which are initially magnetized with mass-to-flux ratios 3, 5, 10 and 100, respectively, and two purely hydrodynamic clouds with varying initial strengths of turbulence. We then apply an in-house clump-finding algorithm to the 3D SPH data in order to quantify the differences in mass and properties of the cores across the degrees of magnetic and turbulent support. We find that although the magnetic fields cause differences in the global cloud evolution, the masses and properties of the cores which form are broadly similar across the different initial conditions. Cores initially form with masses comparable to the initial thermal Jeans mass of the clouds, and then slowly increase in mass with time. We find that regardless of initial magnetization, the fields become dynamically relevant at densities of $\rho > 1\times10^{-17}$ g cm$^{-3}$ - comparable to core densities - and channel material along the field lines, decreasing the stable magnetic Jeans mass, such that the limiting factor for fragmentation is the thermal Jeans mass. We conclude that magnetic fields are not capable of forming and supporting initially high-mass cores against fragmentation.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold neutral hydrogen (HI) is a crucial precursor for molecular gas formation and can be studied via HI absorption. This study investigates HI absorption in low column density regions of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) using the Galactic-ASKAP HI (GASKAP-HI) survey, conducted by the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We select 10 SMC directions in the outer regions and 18 LMC directions, with 4 in the outskirts and 14 within the main disk. Using the radiative transfer method, we decompose the emission and absorption spectra into individual cold neutral medium (CNM) and warm neutral medium (WNM) components. In the SMC, we find HI peak optical depths of 0.09-1.16, spin temperatures of ~20-50 K, and CNM fractions of 1-11%. In the LMC, optical depths range from 0.03 to 3.55, spin temperatures from ~10 to 100 K, and CNM fractions from 1% to 100%. The SMC's low CNM fractions likely result from its low metallicity and large line-of-sight depth. Additionally, the SMC's outskirts show lower CNM fractions than the main body, potentially due to increased CNM evaporation influenced by the hot Magellanic Corona. Shell motions dominate the kinematics of the majority of CNM clouds in this study and likely supply cold HI to the Magellanic Stream. In the LMC, high CNM fraction clouds are found near supergiant shells, where thermal instability induced by stellar feedback promotes WNM-to-CNM transition. Although no carbon monoxide (CO) has been detected, enhanced dust shielding in these areas helps maintain the cold HI.
