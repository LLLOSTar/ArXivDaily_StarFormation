#### Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field decreases the mass of NS. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field increases the deformation of rotating NSs.
#### Cracking the relation between mass and 1P-star fraction of globular clusters: II. The masses in 1P and 2P stars as a second tool

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic globular clusters contain two main groups of stars, the pristine or 1P stars, and the polluted or 2P stars. The pristine-star fraction in clusters, $F_{1P}$, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, $m_{prst}$. Paper~I has introduced a model mapping the region of the $(m_{prst},F_{1P})$ space occupied by clusters, with the cluster mass threshold for 2P-star formation a key building-block. We now expand this model to the pristine-star fraction in dependence of the pristine- and polluted-population masses. Milone et al.(2020) found that $F_{1P}$ anticorrelates more tightly with the polluted-population present-day mass, $m_{2P,prst}$, than with the cluster total mass, $m_{prst}$. In contrast, $F_{1P}$ anticorrelates poorly with the pristine-population current mass, $m_{1P,prst}$. We show the loose anticorrelation between $F_{1P}$ and $m_{1P,prst}$ to result from a roughly constant pristine-population mass among clusters as they start their long-term evolution in the Galactic tidal field. As for the tight anticorrelation between $m_{2P,prst}$ and $F_{1P}$, it stems from the initially shallow relation between $m_{2P}$ and $F_{1P}$ (Fig.4). Clusters of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) appear to behave unexpectedly with respect to each other. For a given $F_{1P}$, LMC clusters are more massive than SMC clusters despite their enduring a stronger tidal field (Fig.6). This is opposite to how the Galactic outer- and inner-halo clusters behave (bottom panels of Figs 1-3). The explanation may lie in cluster formation conditions. Finally, we wonder whether the single-population clusters NGC~419 and Rup~106 formed as multiple-populations clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 A Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is likely to be observed in neutrino detectors around the world minutes to hours before the electromagnetic radiation arrives. The SNEWS2.0 network of neutrino and dark matter detectors aims to use the relative arrival times of the neutrinos at the different experiments to point back to the supernova. One of the simplest methods to calculate the CCSN direction is to use the first neutrino events detected through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process, $\overline{\nu}_e p\rightarrow e^+n$. We will consider neutrino detectors sensitive to IBD interactions with low backgrounds. The difference in signal arrival times between a large and a small detector will be biased, however, with the first event at the smaller detector, on average, arriving later than that at the larger detector. This bias can be mitigated by using these first events in a data-driven approach without recourse to simulations or models. In this article, we demonstrate this method and its uncertainty estimate using pairs of detectors of different sizes and with different supernova distances. Finally, we use this method to calculate probability skymaps using four detectors (Super-Kamiokande, JUNO, LVD, and SNO+) and show that the calculated probabilities yield appropriate confidence intervals. The resulting skymaps should be useful for the multi-messenger community to follow up on the SNEWS2.0 Galactic CCSN neutrino alert.

 - **Abstract**
 The Magellanic Stream, a tidal tail of diffuse gas falling onto the Milky Way, formed by interactions between the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, is primarily composed of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI). The deficiency of dust and the diffuse nature of the present gas make molecular formation rare and difficult, but if present, could lead to regions potentially suitable for star formation, thereby allowing us to probe conditions of star formation similar to those at high redshifts. We search for HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, and C$_2$H using the highest sensitivity observations of molecular absorption data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array to trace these regions, comparing with HI archival data to compare these environments in the Magellanic Stream to the HI column density threshold for molecular formation in the Milky Way. We also compare the line of sight locations with confirmed locations of stars, molecular hydrogen, and OI detections, though at higher sensitivities than the observations presented here. We find no detections to a 3$\sigma$ significance, despite four sightlines having column densities surpassing the threshold for molecular formation in the diffuse regions of the Milky Way. Here we present our calculations for the upper limits of the column densities of each of these molecular absorption lines, ranging from $3 \times 10^{10}$ to $1 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. The non-detection of HCO$^+$ suggests that at least one of the following is true: (i) $X_{HCO^+, \mathrm{MS}}$ is significantly lower than the Milky Way value; (ii) that the widespread diffuse molecular gas observed in the Milky Way's diffuse ISM does not have a direct analog in the MS; (iii) the HI-to-H$_2$ transition occurs in the MS at a higher surface density in the MS than in the LMC or SMC; or (iv) molecular gas exists in the MS, but only in small, dense clumps.
#### The DAWES review: Gravitational-wave burst astrophysics

 - **Abstract**
 Over a hundred gravitational-wave signals have now been detected from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars, but other sources of gravitational waves have not yet been discovered. Some of the most violent explosive events in the Universe are predicted to emit bursts of gravitational waves, and may result in the next big multi-messenger discovery. Gravitational-wave burst signals often have an unknown waveform shape, and unknown gravitational-wave energy, due to unknown or very complicated progenitor astrophysics. Potential sources of gravitational-wave bursts include core-collapse supernovae, cosmic strings, fast radio bursts, eccentric binary systems, and gravitational-wave memory. In this review, we discuss the astrophysical properties of the main predicted sources of gravitational-wave bursts, and the known features of their gravitational-wave emission. We summarise their future detection prospects, and discuss the challenges of searching for gravitational-wave burst signals and interpreting the astrophysics of the source.
#### Could the recent rebrightening of the GW170817A afterglow be caused by a counter jet?

 - **Abstract**
 GRB170817A (also GW170817) became the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger event detected via gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals. Over the next 4 years, various multiband observations have led to re-imagine the various short Gamma Ray Burts (sGRB) and interstellar medium interaction models. While these models successfully explain the observed afterglow until ~900 days, a re-brightening or excess flux was observed in the 1keV X-Ray band after ~1000 days. In this study, we re-evaluate the jet parameters using the new observations (until ~1234 days) with a boosted fireball jet model. We study the observable effects of the counter-jet for GRB170817A, using our new afterglow code, Firefly. Our results show that it is indeed possible for the observed excess to coincide with the emissions from the counter-jet (~800 days). We also computed an empirical scaling law between the jet and counter-jet peak emission timescales and the observer angle. The Firefly code can also track the simulated object through the observers' sky and numerically model the apparent motion. The calculated apparent motion (~2.6c) does not match the observed apparent motion (7.5c to 5.2c). Hence we conclude, the excess flux of GRB170817A may not be associated with the counter jet; however, it is not enough to reject this hypothesis from the traditional counter jet visibility time scales, which predicts > 5000 days. The apparent motion, combined with the multi-band lightcurves, is needed to break degeneracy between geometrical parameters and the microphysical parameters of the afterglow.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense clumps distributed along filaments are the immediate medium for star formation. Kinematic properties of the clumps, such as velocity gradient and angular momentum, combined with filament orientation, provide important clues to the formation mechanism of filament-clump configurations and the role of filaments in star formation. By cross-matching the Milky Way atlas for linear filaments and the Structure, Excitation and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) 13CO (2-1) data, we aim to derive the velocity gradient and its direction, the specific angular momentum (J/M), and the ratio (\beta) between the rotational energy and gravitational energy of clumps, as well as to investigate the alignment between clump rotation and filament orientation. We found a monotonic increase in J/M as a function of clump size (R), following a power-law relation J/M~\propto~R^{1.5\pm0.2}. The ratio \beta ranges from 1.1~\times~10^{-5} to 0.1, with a median value 1.0~\times~10^{-3}, suggesting that clump rotation provides insignificant support against gravitational collapse. The distribution of the angle between clump rotation and natal filament orientation is random, indicating that the clumps' rotational axes have no discernible correlation with the orientation of their hosting filaments. Counting only the most massive clump in each filament also finds no alignment between clump rotation and filament orientation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethanolamine (NH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$OH, EA) has been identified in the gas phase of the ISM within molecular clouds. Although EA has not been directly observed in the molecular ice phase, a solid state formation mechanism has been proposed. However, the current literature lacks an estimation of the infrared band strengths of EA ices. We conducted an experimental investigation of solid EA ice at low temperatures to ascertain its infrared band strengths, phase transition temperature, and multilayer binding energy. The commonly used laser interferometry method was not applied. Infrared band strengths were determined using three distinct methods. The obtained lab spectrum of EA was compared with the publicly available MIRI MRS James Webb Space Telescope observations toward a low mass protostar. The phase transition temperature for EA ice falls within the range of 175 to 185 K. Among the discussed methods, the simple pressure gauge method provides a reasonable estimate of band strength. We derive a band strength value of about $1\times10^{-17}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$ for the NH$_2$ bending mode in the EA molecules. Additionally, temperature-programmed desorption analysis yielded a multilayer desorption energy of 0.61$\pm$0.01 eV. By comparing the laboratory data documented in this study with the JWST spectrum of the low mass protostar IRAS 2A, an upper-limit for the EA ice abundances was derived.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova blasts envelop many surrounding stellar systems, transferring kinetic energy to small bodies in the systems. Geologic evidence from $^{60}\rm Fe$ points to recent nearby supernova activity within the past several Myr. Here, we model the transfer of energy and resulting orbital changes from these supernova blasts to the Oort Cloud, the Kuiper belt, and Saturn's Phoebe ring. For the Oort Cloud, an impulse approximation shows that a 50 pc supernova can eject approximately half of all objects less than 1 cm while altering the trajectories of larger ones, depending on their orbital parameters. For stars closest to supernovae, objects up to $\sim$100 m can be ejected. Turning to the explored solar system, we find that supernovae closer than 50 pc may affect Saturn's Phoebe ring and can sweep away Kuiper belt dust. It is also possible that the passage of the solar system through a dense interstellar cloud could have a similar effect; a numerical trajectory simulation shows that the location of the dust grains and the direction of the wind (from a supernova or interstellar cloud) has a significant impact on whether or not the grains will become unbound from their orbit in the Kuiper belt. Overall, nearby supernovae sweep micron-sized dust from the solar system, though whether the grains are ultimately cast towards the Sun or altogether ejected depends on various factors. Evidence of supernova-modified dust grain trajectories may be observed by New Horizons, though further modeling efforts are required.
#### Most High-density Exoplanets Are Unlikely to Be Remnant Giant-planet Cores

 - **Abstract**
 Some exoplanets have much higher densities than expected from stellar abundances of planet-forming elements. There are two theories - metal-rich formation hypothesis and naked core hypothesis - that explain how formation and evolution can alter the compositions and structures of rocky planets to diverge from their primordial building blocks. Here, we revisit the naked core hypothesis, which states that high-density planets are remnant cores of giant planets that remain in a fossil-compressed state, even after envelope loss. Using a planetary interior model and assuming energy-limited atmospheric escape, we show that a large fraction, if not all, of the iron-silicate core of a giant planet is molten during the planet's early evolution. Upon envelope loss, molten part of the planets can rapidly rebound due to low viscosity, resulting in a decrease in radius by at most 0.06%, if they had hydrogen/helium envelopes, or by at most 7%, if they had H$_2$O envelopes, compared to self-compressed counterparts with the same core mass fraction. Based on our findings, we reject the hypothesis that all high-density exoplanets are naked cores with Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value $\ll$ 0.05 for both envelope compositions. We find that some high-density exoplanets can still possibly be naked cores, but the probabilities are lower than $\sim$1/2 and $\sim$1/3 for the ice giant and gas giant scenario, respectively, in 95% of the cases. We conclude that most high-density exoplanets are unlikely to be remnant giant-planets cores.
#### Photometric detection of internal gravity waves in upper main-sequence stars. IV. Comparable SLF variability in SMC, LMC and Galactic massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Massive main-sequence stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes, and sub-surface convection zones. However, their properties strongly depend on a star's opacity and metallicity. Non-rotating 1D evolution models of main-sequence stars between $7 \leq M \leq 40$ M$_{\odot}$ and metallicity of the SMC suggest tenuous sub-surface convection zones when using the Rayleigh number as a criterion for convection. We test if massive stars of different metallicities inside and outside of stability windows for sub-surface convection exhibit similar properties in their observed SLF variability. We extract customised light curves from the ongoing TESS mission for a sample of massive stars using an effective point spread function (ePSF) method, and compare them using a Gaussian process (GP) regression methodology. We demonstrate that the properties of SLF variability observed in time-series photometry of massive stars are consistent across the metallicity range from the Milky Way down to the SMC galaxy, for stars both inside and outside of the sub-surface stability windows. We conclude that non-rotating 1D stellar structure models of sub-surface convection cannot alone be used to explain the mechanism giving rise to SLF variability in light curves of massive stars. Additionally, the similar properties of SLF variability across a large range in metallicity, which follow the same trends in mass and age in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram at both high and low metallicity, support a transition in the dominant mechanism causing SLF variability from younger to more evolved stars. Specifically, core-excited internal gravity waves (IGWs) are more favourable for younger stars that lack substantial sub-surface convection zones, especially at low-metallicity, and sub-surface convection zones are more favourable for the most massive and evolved stars.

#### The Nature of a Recently Discovered Wolf-Rayet Binary: Archetype of Stripping?

 - **Abstract**
 LMCe055-1 was recently discovered in a survey for WRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and classified as a WN4/O4, a lower excitation version of the WN3/O3 class discovered as part of the same survey. Its absolute magnitude precluded it from being a WN4+O4 binary. OGLE photometry show shallow primary and secondary eclipses with a 2.2 day period. The spectral characteristics and short period pointed to a possible origin due to binary stripping. Such stripped WR binaries should be common but have proven elusive to identify conclusively. In order to establish its nature, we obtained HST UV and Magellan optical spectra, along with imaging. Our work shows that the WR emission and He II absorption arise in one star, and the He I absorption in another. The He I contributor is the primary of the 2.2-day system and exhibits ~300 km/sed radial velocity variations on that time scale. However, the WR star shows 30-40 km/sed radial velocity variations, with a likely 35-day period and a highly eccentric orbit. Possibly LMCe055-1 is a physical triple, but that would require the 2.2-day pair to have been captured by the WR star. A more likely explanation is that the WR star has an unseen companion in a 35-day orbit and that the 2.2-day pair is in a longer period orbit about the two. Such examples of multiple systems are well known among massive stars, such as HD 5980. Regardless, we argue that it is highly unlikely that the WR component of the LMCe055-1 system resulted from stripping.
