 - **Abstract**
 Context. The Dust Settling Instabilty (DSI) is a member of the Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDI) family, and is thus related to the Streaming Instability (SI). Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has growth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas ratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong dust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear saturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence behaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By characterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we can shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform a suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the mono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum dust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as analyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse simulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates earlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The polydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and produce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the monodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but separate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further clumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at densities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI produces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests that the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than the SI from including a dust size distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The LHAASO observatory has recently measured details of the cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum in the knee region (1 -- 10 PeV) with unprecedented precision, including its average CR mass composition and the spectrum of the proton component. We use these precision measurements, combined with direct measurements of CRs by space-based detectors, to derive predictions for the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino emission from the interstellar medium under the assumption that the CR spectrum is universal throughout the Milky Way. We compare these predictions with the Fermi-LAT and LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray flux from inner and outer Galactic Plane regions and with estimates of the neutrino flux based on the IceCube data for the same Galactic Plane regions. We notice that the model predictions exceed LHAASO gamma-ray measurements at energies above 100 TeV. This excess can be interpreted within a CR knee model assuming a "local PeV CR bubble''. Within this model, we infer the extension of the local PeV CR bubble of 1.5 +/- 0.3 kpc in the direction of the inner Galaxy and of 0.7+/-0.3 kpc toward the outer Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of after emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, as well as the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present VegasAfterglow, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as keynotes of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that VegasAfterglow is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We couple a simplified model for the galactic chemical evolution, with software that models the condensation of dust in protoplanetary disks and software that models the interior structure of planets in order to estimate the effects that the galactic chemical evolution has on the properties of planets as they form over time. We find that the early abundance of elements formed from the evolution and death of high-mass stars (such as Oxygen, Silicon, and Magnesium) yields planets with larger mantles and smaller cores. The later addition of elements produced in low-mass stars (such as Iron and Nickel) causes the planet cores to become relatively larger. The result is planets that orbit older stars are less dense than planets orbiting younger stars. These results are broadly consistent with recent observations of planet properties from stars of varying ages.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical mechanisms that regulate the collapse of high-mass parsec-scale clumps and allow them to form clusters of new stars represent a crucial aspect of star formation. To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta Stone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based on the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump fragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare ALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a new set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump fragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing strategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values of clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of turbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization (mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with two random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a collection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump fragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among the initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest impact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of clump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with magnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or multiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments are actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout the whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not isolated from the environment. Our study demonstrates the importance of synthetic observations in interpreting results from interferometric observations.
#### A low mass, binary-stripped envelope for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo

 - **Abstract**
 Type IIb supernovae (SNe) are a transitional subclass of stripped-envelope SNe showing hydrogen lines in their spectra that gradually weaken and give way to helium lines reminiscent of SNe Ib, which is indicative of stripping through stellar winds or binary interaction. SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a direct progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our ERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival HST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5 giant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar masses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with an initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for variability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN 2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At late times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe, which may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN 2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic light curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen in the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at early times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha absorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to explain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out single-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary companion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features would support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which underwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion, resulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds are interesting laboratories to study the acceleration of cosmic rays and their propagation in the dense ambient medium. We analyze 14 years of Fermi-LAT observations of the supernova remnant Puppis A to investigate its asymmetric $\gamma$-ray morphology and spectral properties. This middle-aged remnant ($\sim$4 kyr) is evolving in an inhomogeneous environment, interacting with a dense molecular cloud in the northeast and a lower-density medium in the southwest. We find clear differences in both $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spectral energy distribution between these two regions. The emission from both sides is consistent with a hadronic origin. However, while the southwestern emission can be explained by standard Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA), the northeastern side may involve re-acceleration of pre-existing cosmic rays or acceleration via reflected shocks in the dense cloud environment. Additionally, we identify two significant $\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a previously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced by cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense molecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy in escaping cosmic rays to be $W_{CR} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{49}$ erg, providing important constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 Light pollution is an increasing environmental concern, impacting both ecological systems and human health. This report presents an analysis of light pollution data from the \textit{Was het donker} SQM network from 2020 until 2023, with a focus on indirect light pollution, commonly known as skyglow. By integrating measurements from Sky Quality Meter (SQM) stations in the network and cloud cover data from EUMETSAT, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of night sky brightness across a region encompassing northern Netherlands and the western part of the German Wadden Coast. Yearly changes in brightness for 27 locations were ranked and plotted, revealing that in the darkest areas, light pollution is increasing at a rate of 2.78 to 6.68 percent per year. A trend emerged showing that brighter areas experienced lower variability in brightness, while darker zones exhibited higher variability. This is due to the dominance of artificial light sources, such as street lighting, in brighter areas, which reduces the influence of natural light sources like the Moon, stars, and cloud backscatter. Seasonal patterns and the effects of the Milky Way were also investigated. Density plots were employed to visualize these changes in night sky brightness, helping to identify specific sources of light pollution, such as greenhouse lighting and streetlight turn-off times. These findings emphasize the need for systematic monitoring of light pollution and offer valuable insights that can guide public awareness initiatives and inform light pollution mitigation strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a variety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up, measurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift estimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of machine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning algorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual algorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We include results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved photometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated data and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$ score, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We evaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In this scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes, reaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\geq2.1$ and $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its performance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We conclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version of the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks suggest a typical uncertainty of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to our results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large enough for a full statistical consideration.
#### Identifying galactic binary systems of neutron stars and black holes with LISA

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect ~ 100 galactic binary systems comprised of black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Identifying the nature of the constituents of these binaries as BHs or NSs, and distinguishing them from $\sim 10^4$ detected double white dwarfs will be challenging. In the absence of any other information, the inferred values of the component masses can be used to classify the nature of these objects. However, short-period galactic binaries $\sim 10^7 - 10^3$ yr from coalescence produce a quasi-monochromatic signal which carries little information about their masses. We generate synthetic LISA data sets containing gravitational waves (GWs) from galactic binary BHs, binary NSs and BHNSs drawn from an astrophysically realistic population produced through the isolated binary evolution channel. We process the data with an end-to-end Bayesian inference pipeline to explore the accuracy with which the individual component masses can be measured. We find that for $\approx 10\% - 50\%$ of the detected systems LISA will be able to measure the individual component masses by measuring the orbital eccentricity, periapse precession frequency, and GW induced frequency derivative. Typical fractional mass errors are $\approx 1\% - 100\%$ (depending on the specific value of the source parameters), which will enable in many circumstances the classification of the objects as BHs or NSs. For these binaries, LISA will also be able to determine their 3-dimensional position in the Milky Way. The LISA-detected sample of these double compact objects will provide new information about the galactic population of BHs and NSs, the star formation history of the Milky Way and the astrophysical processes leading to the formation of these systems. However, for a significant fraction of the LISA-detected binaries the nature of their constituent objects may remain unclear.
