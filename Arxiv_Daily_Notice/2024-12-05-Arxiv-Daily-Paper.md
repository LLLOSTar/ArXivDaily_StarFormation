#### Synoptic Wide-field EVN--e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) -- I. First steps towards commensal surveys with VLBI

 - **Abstract**
 The high angular resolution and sensitivity of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) offer a unique tool to identify and study active galactic nuclei and star-formation activity over cosmic time. However, despite recent technical advances, such as multiple phase centre correlation, VLBI surveys have thus far been limited to either a few well-studied deep-fields or wide-areas to a relatively shallow depth. To enter the era of extensive statistical studies at high angular resolution, a significantly larger area of the sky must be observed to much better sensitivity with VLBI. The Synoptic Wide-field EVN--e-MERLIN Public Survey (SWEEPS) is a proposed commensal observing mode for the EVN and e-MERLIN, where single-target principle investigator-led observations are re-correlated at the position of known radio sources within 12 arcmin of the pointing centre. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this methodology by detecting a 5.6 mJy core-jet object at 1.7 GHz that would have otherwise been lost from the parent data set. This is the first object to be recovered as part of the SWEEPS pilot programme, which highlights the potential for increasing sample sizes of VLBI-detected radio sources with commensal observing modes in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or merger-induced collapse (MIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems is an interesting path to neutron star (NS) and magnetar formation, alternative to stellar core collapse and NS mergers. Such events could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they are expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including gamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (>5 s post bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and velocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment scheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different masses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our simulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the proto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early neutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at later times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture supernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our rotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more neutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms around the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC and MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which may imply constraints on their occurrence rates. Finally, our simulations neglect the effects of triaxial deformation and magnetic fields, serving as a temporary benchmark for more comprehensive future studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The cross-correlation of cosmic voids with the lensing convergence ($\kappa$) map of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations provides a powerful tool to refine our understanding of the cosmological model. However, several studies have reported a moderate tension between the lensing imprint of cosmic voids on the observed CMB and the simulated $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM signal. To address this "lensing-is-low" tension and to obtain new, precise measurements, we exploit the large DESI Legacy Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) dataset, covering approximately 19,500 $°^2$ of the sky and including about 10 million LRGs at $z < 1.05$. Our $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM template was created using the Buzzard mocks, which we specifically calibrated to match the clustering properties of the observed galaxy sample by exploiting more than one million DESI spectra. We identified our catalogs of 3D voids in the range $0.35 < z < 0.95$, dividing the sample into bins according to the redshift and $\lambda_\mathrm{v}$ values of the voids. We report a 14$\sigma$ detection of the lensing signal, with $A_\kappa = 1.016 \pm 0.054$, which increases to 17$\sigma$ when considering the void-in-void ($A_\kappa = 0.944 \pm 0.064$) and the void-in-cloud ($A_\kappa = 0.975 \pm 0.060$) populations individually, the highest detection significance for studies of this kind. We observe a full agreement between the observations and $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM predictions across all redshift bins, sky regions, and void populations considered. In addition to these findings, our analysis highlights the importance of matching sparseness and redshift error distributions between mocks and observations, as well as the role of $\lambda_\mathrm{v}$ in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.
#### Constraining differential rotation in gamma Doradus stars from inertial dips properties

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of dips in the gravity modes period spacing versus period diagram of gamma Doradus stars is now well established by recent asteroseismic studies. Such Lorentzian-shaped inertial dips arise from the interaction of gravito-inertial modes in the radiative envelope of intermediate-mass main sequence stars with pure inertial modes in their convective core. They allow to study stellar internal properties. This window on stellar internal dynamics is extremely valuable in the context of the understanding of angular momentum transport inside stars, since it allows us to probe rotation in their core. We investigate the signature and the detectability of a differential rotation between the convective core and the near-core region inside gamma Doradus stars from the inertial dip properties. We study the coupling between gravito-inertial modes in the radiative zone and pure inertial modes in the convective core in the sub-inertial regime, allowing for a two-zones differential rotation from the two sides of the boundary. Taking a bi-layer rotation profile, we derive the wave equations in the convective core and the radiative envelope. We solve the coupling equation numerically and match the result to an analytical derivation of the Lorentzian dip. We then use typical values of measured near-core rotation and buoyancy travel time to infer ranges of parameters for which differential core to near-core rotation would be detectable in current Kepler data. We show that increasing the convective core rotation with respect to the near-core rotation leads to a shift of the period of the observed dip to lower periods. In addition, the dip gets deeper and thinner as the convective core rotation increases. We demonstrate that such a signature is detectable in Kepler data, given appropriate dip parameter ranges and near-core structural properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.
#### Transiting Jupiters around M-dwarfs have similar masses to FGK warm-Jupiters

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets ($\gtrsim$ 8$R_{\oplus}$) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters ( $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_J$) around M-dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of $v$sin$i$ related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published non-detections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.
#### Signatures of the Shock Interaction as an Additional Power Source in the Nebular Spectra of SN 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiants may lose significant mass through steady winds and episodic eruptions in the final 100-1000 years before the core collapses, shaping their circumstellar environment. Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and distant circumstellar material (CSM) can generate shocks, which can energize the ejecta and serve as a key power source during the nebular phase of the SN. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. This marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum, H$\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad components centred at $\sim\pm 5650\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ from the rest velocity of H$\alpha$, which are seen for only a few SNe to date. These features indicate energy deposition from shocks generated by the interaction of ejecta with a CSM expelled nearly 350 $-$ 640 years pre-explosion. Comparisons of the +363 d spectrum with model spectra from the literature, that include varying shock powers, suggest a shock power of at least $\sim 5 \times 10 ^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ at this epoch. Additionally, analysis of the [O I] doublet, along with other prominent emission lines, provides evidence for clumpiness, dust formation, and asymmetry within the ejecta and/or the surrounding CSM. These emission lines also helped to constrain the oxygen mass ($\approx0.19^{\scriptscriptstyle +0.08}_{\scriptscriptstyle -0.04} M_\odot$), He-core mass ($<3 M_\odot$) and the zero-age main sequence mass ($\lesssim 12 M_\odot$) of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf. The comparison with other Type II SNe highlights SN 2023ixf's unique shock interaction signatures and evidence of dust formation, setting it apart in terms of evolution and dynamics.
#### Angular Momentum Drain: Despinning Embedded Planetesimals

 - **Abstract**
 Young and forming planetesimals experience impacts from particles present in a protostellar disk. Using crater scaling laws, we integrate ejecta distributions for oblique impacts. For impacts at 10 to 65 m/s, expected for impacts associated with a disk wind, we estimate the erosion rate and torque exerted on the planetesimal. We find that the mechanism for angular momentum drain proposed by Dobrovolskis and Burns (1984) for asteroids could operate in the low velocity regime of a disk wind. Though spin-down associated with impacts can facilitate planetesimal collapse, we find that the process is inefficient. We find that angular momentum drain via impacts operates in the gravitational focusing regime, though even less efficiently than for lower mass planetesimals. The angular momentum transfer is most effective when the wind speed is low, the projectile density is high compared to the bulk planetesimal density, and the planetesimal is composed of low-strength material. Due to its inefficiency, we find that angular momentum drain due to impacts within a pebble cloud does not by itself facilitate collapse of single planetesimals.
