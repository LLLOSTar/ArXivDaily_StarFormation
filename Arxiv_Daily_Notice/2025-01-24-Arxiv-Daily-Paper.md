 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the long-term optical/IR behavior of 111 high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud based on data from the OGLE collaboration. Most systems exhibit variability on a range of time scales. This variability regulates the mass transfer to the compact object, while the compact object can, in turn, affect the donor star's behavior. To better understand this complex interaction and the resulting X-ray properties in these systems, we define a new taxonomy for the observed super-orbital variability. This taxonomy connects to the color changes, orbital periods, and X-ray behavior of the sources. In most cases, these properties can be explained by differences between the flux of the disk around the Be star and the flux from the star itself. We also refine and present new potential orbital periods and sub-orbital variability in the sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding solar turbulent convection and its influence on differential rotation has been a challenge over the past two decades. Current models often overestimate giant convection cells amplitude, leading to an effective Rossby number too large and a shift towards an anti-solar rotation regime. This Convective Conundrum, underscores the need for improved comprehension of solar convective dynamics. We propose a numerical experiment in the parameter space that controls $Ro$ while increasing the Reynolds number ($Re$) and maintaining solar parameters. By controlling the Nusselt number ($Nu$), we limit the energy transport by convection while reducing viscous dissipation. This approach enabled us to construct a Sun-like rotating model (SBR97n035) with strong turbulence ($Re \sim 800$) that exhibits prograde equatorial rotation and aligns with observational data from helioseismology. We compare this model with an anti-solar rotating counterpart, and provide an in-depth spectral analysis to investigate the changes in convective dynamics. We also find the appearance of vorticity rings near the poles, which existence on the Sun could be probed in the future. The Sun-like model shows reduced buoyancy over the spectrum, as well as an extended quasi-geostrophic equilibrium towards smaller scales. This promotes a Coriolis-Inertia (CI) balance rather than a Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedes (CIA) balance, in order to favor the establishment of a prograde equator. The presence of convective columns in the bulk of the convection zone, with limited surface manifestations, also hints at such structures potentially occurring in the Sun.
#### Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used ("classic") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as "special trajectories." Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.
#### Resolution Dependence of Cloud-Wind Simulations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13186

 - **Abstract**
 Using a set of wind-tunnel simulations, we investigate the effect that numerical resolution has on cloud evolution and acceleration. We also consider the role of wind speed in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes, using adiabatic simulations with wind speeds of 100 km/s and 1000 km/s, respectively. For each setup, we explore five numerical resolutions. We find that the fate of the cloud is significantly affected by the resolution, but the trend is surprisingly non-monotonic. In the subsonic case, we find that a resolution of 16 cells per cloud radius is a turning point in the cloud evolution. In the supersonic case the trend is more monotonic, consistent with the difference in timescales for which ram pressure acceleration dominates over mixing in the early acceleration.
#### Beyond MESA Defaults: The Impact of Structural Resolution Uncertainty in p-mode Asteroseismology

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of pressure modes ($p$-modes) in stars have enabled profound insights into stellar properties, and theoretical stellar evolution and oscillation models are integral to these inferences. However, modeling uncertainties are often overlooked, even as they can rival or exceed observational uncertainties. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the impact of structural resolution choices in 1D stellar evolution calculations on predicted $p$-mode frequencies across the HR diagram, using \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{GYRE}. We present measurements of resolution-based modeling uncertainty for a range of solar-like, upper main-sequence, and Mira oscillators and compare these directly to TESS observational uncertainties. We demonstrate that resolution-driven uncertainties can significantly influence theoretical predictions and in some cases overwhelm observational uncertainties by orders of magnitude: while solar-like oscillators typically have fractional, resolution-based uncertainties at or below 1\% of the test frequency, fractional uncertainties in Miras were as large as 20\%. We also find that the location and morphology of the RGB bump and red clump are impacted substantially by resolution uncertainty. Stellar ages are impacted at the 10\% level for young main-sequence stars, and the model-based correction factor for the $\Delta\nu$--$\sqrt{\rho}$ scaling relation is impacted at the 2\% level. Our results underscore the need to incorporate modeling uncertainties into asteroseismic analyses and provide a reference framework for observers evaluating the reliability of theoretical models.
#### Incorporating Magnetic Field Characteristics into EUV-Based Automated Segmentation of Coronal Holes

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal holes (CH) are magnetically open regions that allow hot coronal plasma to escape from the Sun and form the high-speed solar wind. This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the boundary which identifies the CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while simultaneously allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to the aforementioned inconsistent intensities.

 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets dominate the mass of many planetary systems, including the Solar System, and represent the best-characterized class of extrasolar planets. Understanding the formation of giant planets bridges the high mass end of the planet formation process and the low mass end of processes that produce stellar and brown dwarf companions. This review examines the latest evidence supporting the formation of Solar System giant planets and most extrasolar giant planets by core accretion. Key elements of this theory and recent advances are discussed, along with the role of gravitational fragmentation of gas disks -- a mechanism more likely to produce brown dwarfs and/or similarly massive binary companions.
#### The neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of nova outburst

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13259

 - **Abstract**
 The nova outburst can produce a large number of neutrinos, whether it is the nuclear reaction process during the explosion or the shock wave acceleration proton process. We study the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity of novae with CO white dwarf (WD) mass ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 $\rm M_{\odot}$ with different accretion rates $\dot{M}$, core temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{C}})$, and mixing degrees. We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon luminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity. During the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly produced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the more massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not taken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=1\times10^{7}\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We also predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB). We estimate that the next T CrB outburst has a low-energy nuclear neutrino peak luminosity of $2.7\times10^{8}\ \rm L_{\nu,\odot}$ and a low-energy nuclear neutrino outburst duration of 88 days. In addition, we predict that the high-energy hadronic neutrino flux produced by T CrB nova can not be observed by the current-generation IceCube.

 - **Abstract**
 The radio source J0028+0035 is a recently discovered double--double radio galaxy at redshift z=0.398. Its relic outer lobes are separated by about 3' in the sky, corresponding to ~1 Mpc projected linear size. Inside this large-scale structure, the inner pair of collinear lobes span about 100 kpc. In the arcsec-resolution radio images of J0028+0035, there is a central radio feature that offers the intriguing possibility of being resolved into a pc-scale, third pair of innermost lobes. This would make this radio galaxy a rare triple-double source where traces of three distinct episodes of radio activity could be observed. To reveal the compact radio structure of the central component, we conducted observation with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer Network and the enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network. Our 1.66 GHz image with high (~5 milliarcsec) resolution shows a compact central radio core with no indication of a third, innermost double feature. The observation performed in multi-phase-centre mode also revealed that the physically unrelated but in projection closely separated background source 5BZU J0028+0035 has a single weak, somewhat resolved radio feature, at odds with its blazar classification.
#### The bright long-lived Type II SN 2021irp powered by aspherical circumstellar material interaction (I): Revealing the energy source with photometry and spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 Some core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are too luminous and radiate too much total energy to be powered by the release of thermal energy from the ejecta and radioactive-decay energy from the synthesised $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co. A source of additional power is the interaction between the supernova (SN) ejecta and a massive circumstellar material (CSM). This is an important power source in Type IIn SNe, which show narrow spectral lines arising from the unshocked CSM, but not all interacting SNe show such narrow lines. We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the hydrogen-rich SN 2021irp, which is both luminous, with $M_{o} < -19.4$ mag, and long-lived, remaining brighter than $M_{o} = -18$ mag for $\sim$ 250 d. We show that an additional energy source is required to power such a SN, and determine the nature of the source. We also investigate the properties of the pre-existing and newly formed dust associated with the SN. Photometric observations show that the luminosity of the SN is an order of magnitude higher than typical Type II SNe and persists for much longer. We detect a infrared excess attributed to dust emission. Spectra show multi-component line profiles, an Fe II pseudo-continuum, and a lack of absorption lines, all typical features of Type IIn SNe. We detect a narrow (< 85 kms$^{-1}$) P-Cygni profile associated with the unshocked CSM. An asymmetry in emission line profiles indicates dust formation occurring from 250-300 d. Analysis of the SN blackbody radius evolution indicates asymmetry in the shape of the emitting region. We identify the main power source of SN 2021irp as extensive interaction with a massive CSM, and that this CSM is distributed asymmetrically around the progenitor star. The infrared excess is explained with emission from newly formed dust although there is also some evidence of an IR echo from pre-existing dust at early times.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of pulsations in ultra-massive white dwarfs can help to probe their interiors and unveil their core composition and crystallized mass fraction through asteroseismic techniques. To date, the richest pulsating ultra-massive white dwarf known is BPM 37093 with 8 modes detected, for which detailed asteroseismic analysis has been performed in the past. In this work, we report the discovery of 19 pulsation modes in the ultra-massive white dwarf star WD~J0135+5722, making it the richest pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere ultramassive white dwarf known to date. %In this work, we report the discovery of pulsations in WD~J0135+5722, a hydrogen-rich ultra-massive white dwarf observed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. This object exhibits multi-periodic luminosity variations with periods ranging from 137 to 1345 s, typical of pulsating white dwarfs in the ZZ Ceti instability strip, which is centered at $T_{\rm eff} \sim 12\,000$ K. We estimate the stellar mass of WD J0135+5722 by different methods, resulting in $M_{\star} \sim 1.12-1.14 M_{\odot}$ if the star's core is made of oxygen and neon, or $M_{\star} \sim 1.14-1.15 M_{\odot}$ if the star hosts a carbon oxygen core. Future analysis of the star periods could shed light on the core chemical composition through asteroseismology.
#### ATLASGAL-selected high-mass clumps in the inner Galaxy: XI. Morphology and kinematics of warm inner envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Massive stellar embryos are embedded in warm envelopes that provide mass reservoirs for the accretion process onto final stars. Feedback from star formation activities in return impacts the properties of the envelopes, offering us a unique opportunity to investigate star formation processes. We aim to characterise the warm envelopes of proto- or young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages based on the morphology and kinematics of the $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission and to examine their relations with star formation processes. Using the APEX telescope, we obtained maps of the mid-$J$ $^{13}$CO emission with an angular size of 80" x 80" towards 99 massive clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Our maps are classified based on morphological complexities, and the radial structure of the emission is characterised for simple single-core sources. The velocity centroids of the emission are compared to small- and large-scale gas kinematics, aiming to shed light on the origin of envelope kinematics. $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is detected towards sources in all stages of high-mass star formation, with a detection rate of 83% for the whole sample. The detection rate, line width, and line peak increase with evolution, and the line luminosity is strongly correlated with $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{clump}}$, indicating that the excitation of $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is closely related to star formation processes. In addition, the radial distributions of the emission for single-core sources can be well fitted by power-law functions, suggesting a relatively simple envelope structure for many sources. As for the envelope kinematics, linear velocity gradients are common among the single-core sources. Our comparison of kinematics on different scales suggests that the origin of the linear velocity gradients in the warm envelopes is complex and unclear for many sources.
#### Cold dark gas in Cygnus X: The first large-scale mapping of low-frequency carbon recombination lines

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is critical to explain the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. However, the gas phases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly observe and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming complex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274--399 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope at 21 pc (48') resolution. Of the 30 deg^2 surveyed, we detect line-synthesized C273alpha emission from 24 deg^2 and produce the first large-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs. The morphology of the C273alpha emission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are often on the outskirts of CO emission and likely transitioning from HI-to-H_2. The typical angular separation of C273alpha and 13CO emission is 12 pc, and we estimate C273alpha gas densities of n_H ~ 40 - 400 cm^3. The C273alpha line profiles are Gaussian and likely turbulent broadened, spanning a large range of FWHM from 2 to 20 km/s with a median of 10.6 km/s. Mach numbers fall within 10--30. The turbulent timescale is relatively short, 2.6 Myr, and we deduce that the turbulent pressure likely dominates the evolution of the C273alpha gas. Velocity offsets between C273alpha and 13CO components are apparent throughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km/s. Two regimes have emerged from the data: one regime in which C273alpha and 13CO are strongly related (at N_H ~ 4 x 10^21 cm^-2), and a second, in which C273alpha emits independently of the 13CO intensity. In the former regime, C273alpha may arise from the the envelopes of massive clouds (filaments), and in the latter, C273alpha emits from cold clumps in a more-diffuse mix of HI and H_2 gas.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an atmospheric characterization and orbital analysis of HD 206893 B, an exceptionally red, L/T-transition substellar companion in a multiplanetary system, via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution (R $\sim$ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. Using PHOENIX atmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the companion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at $>8\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an effective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of $4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we measure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \pm 0.02$, or near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits the tentative trend of $>4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios while less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using substellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of $22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this companion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893 B and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital stability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an orbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893 c, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture of the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk fragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for potential ``birthmarks'' left from the formation of filamentary molecular clouds in the Ophiuchus complex. We use high dynamic-range column density and temperature maps derived from \textit{Herschel}, \textit{Planck}, and \textit{2MASS/NICEST} extinction data. We find two distinct types of filaments based on their orientation relative to nearby massive stars: radial (R-type) and tangential (T-type). R-type filaments exhibit decreasing mass profiles away from massive stars, while T-type filaments show flat but structured profiles. We propose a scenario where both filament types originate from the dynamic interplay of compression and stretching forces exerted by a fast outflow emanating from the OB association. The two formation mechanisms leave distinct observable ``birthmarks'' (namely, filament orientation, mass distribution, and star formation location) on each filament type. Our results illustrate a complex phase in molecular cloud evolution with two simultaneous yet contrasting processes: the formation of filaments and stars via the dispersal of residual gas from a previous massive star formation event. Our approach highlights the importance of taking into account the wider context of a star-forming complex, rather than concentrating exclusively on particular subregions.
