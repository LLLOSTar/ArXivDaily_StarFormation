 - **Abstract**
 Born as ice-rich planetesimals, cometary nuclei were gravitationally scattered onto their current orbits in the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud during the giant planets' dynamical instability in the early stages of our Solar System's history. Here, we model the thermal evolution of planetesimals during and after the giant planet instability. We couple an adapted thermal evolution model to orbital trajectories provided by \textit{N}-body simulations to account for the planetesimals' orbital evolution, a parameter so far neglected by previous thermal evolution studies. Our simulations demonstrate intense thermal processing in all planetesimal populations, concerning mainly the hyper-volatile ice content. Unlike previous predictions, we show that hyper-volatile survival was possible in a significant number of planetesimals of the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. Planetesimals ejected into the interstellar space proved to be the most processed, while planetesimals ending in the Oort Cloud were the least processed population. We show that processing differences between populations are a direct consequence of their orbital evolution patterns, and that they provide a natural explanation for the observed variability in the abundance ratios of CO on cometary populations and on the recent observations of long-distance CO-driven activity on inbound Long-period Comets.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Natural interstellar objects do not form isolated in deep space, but escape their natal planetary systems. Early removal from their home star systems via close flybys with still-forming planets could be the dominant ejection mechanism. However, dynamically evolved planetary systems such as the Solar System may also be a significant source of natural interstellar objects. Aims. We studied the dynamical evolution of two unusual Solar System hyperbolic comets, C/1980 E1 (Bowell) and C/2024 L5 (ATLAS), to investigate the circumstances that led them to reach moderate Solar System excess hyperbolic speeds. Methods. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses to explore the planetary encounters that led to the ejection of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5, and studied their pre- and post-encounter trajectories. Results. We confirm that C/1980 E1 reached its present path into interstellar space after an encounter with Jupiter at 0.23 au on December 9, 1980. C/2024 L5 was scattered out of the Solar System following a flyby to Saturn at 0.003 au on January 24, 2022. Integrations backward in time show that C/1980 E1 came from the inner Oort cloud but C/2024 L5 could be a former retrograde, inactive Centaur. The receding velocities of C/1980 E1 and C/2024 L5 when entering interstellar space will be 3.8 and 2.8 km/s, moving towards Aries and Triangulum, respectively. Conclusions. Our results for two comets ejected from the Solar System indicate that dynamically evolved planetary systems can be effective sources of interstellar objects and provide constraints on their velocity distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane implies an abundant population of hadronic cosmic-ray sources in the Milky Way. We explore the role of the coronae of accreting stellar-mass black holes as such astroparticle emitters. We show that the particle acceleration and interaction timescales in the coronal region are tied to the compactness of the X-ray source. Thus, neutrino emission processes may similarly happen in the cores of active galactic nuclei and black hole X-ray binaries (XRB), despite of their drastically different masses and physical sizes. We apply the model to the well-measured XRB Cygnus X-1 and find that the cascaded gamma rays accompanying the neutrino emission naturally explain the GeV emission that only presents during the source's hard state. We show that XRB coronae could contribute significantly to the Galactic cosmic-ray and Galactic plane neutrino fluxes. Our model predicts variable high-energy neutrino emission from bright Galactic XRBs that may be observed by IceCube and future neutrino observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are an important way to probe the properties of stellar populations surrounding supermassive black holes. Observed spectra of several TDEs, such as ASASSN-14li, show high nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios, leading to questions about their progenitors. Disrupting an intermediate- or high-mass star that has undergone CNO processing, increasing the nitrogen in its core, could lead to an enhanced nitrogen TDE. Galactic nuclei present a conducive environment for high-velocity stellar collisions that can lead to high mass loss, stripping the carbon- and hydrogen-rich envelopes of the stars and leaving behind the enhanced nitrogen cores. TDEs of these stripped stars may therefore exhibit even more extreme nitrogen enhancement. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code StarSmasher, we provide a parameter space study of high-velocity stellar collisions involving intermediate-mass stars, analyzing the composition of the collision products. We conclude that high-velocity stellar collisions can form products that have abundance ratios similar to those observed in the motivating TDEs. Furthermore, we show that stars that have not experienced high CNO processing can yield low-mass collision products that retain even higher nitrogen to carbon abundance ratios. We analytically estimate the mass fallback for a typical TDE of several collision products to demonstrate consistency between our models and TDE observations. Lastly, we discuss how the extended collision products, with high central to average density ratios, can be related to repeated partial TDEs like ASASSN-14ko and G objects in the Galactic Center.
#### Evidence that Planets in the Radius Gap Do Not Resemble Their Neighbors

 - **Abstract**
 Planets in compact multi-transiting systems tend to exhibit self-similarity with their neighbors, a phenomenon commonly called "peas-in-a-pod". Previous studies have identified that this self-similarity appears independently among super-Earths and sub-Neptunes orbiting the same star. In this study, we investigate whether the peas-in-a-pod phenomenon holds for planets in the radius gap between these two categories (located at $\sim$1.8$R_{\oplus}$). Employing the Kepler sample of planets in multi-transiting systems, we calculate the radius ratios between radius gap planets and their neighbors. We find that in systems in possession of a radius gap planet, there is a statistically significant deficit of planet pairs with radius ratios near unity, at the level of $3-4\sigma$. We find that neighbors to radius gap planets actually exhibit reverse size-ordering (that is, a larger inner planet is followed by an outer smaller planet) more often than they exhibit self-similarity. We go on to compare whether the period ratios between neighboring planets also differ, and find that radius gap planets are likelier to reside in mean motion resonance with neighbors, compared to non-gap planets (particularly in the 3:2 configuration). We explore the possibility that systems with a radius gap planet may be modified by a process other than photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. The appearance in tandem of unusual size-ordering of gap planets in multi-planet systems, together with unusual spacing, furnishes potential supporting evidence in favor of giant impacts sculpting the radius distribution to some degree.
#### The non-thermal emission following GW170817 is consistent with a conical radially-stratified outflow with initial Lorentz factor $\lesssim10$

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the non-thermal radio to X-ray emission following the neutron star merger GW\,170817 is consistent with synchrotron emission from a collisionless shock driven into the interstellar medium (ISM) by a conical radially stratified outflow observed $\approx0.25$~rad off-axis, with a power-low mass dependence on momentum, $M(>\gamma\beta)\propto(\gamma\beta)^{-5}$, maximum Lorenz factor $\gamma\approx10$, opening (half-)angle $\approx0.2$~rad, and total energy of $\approx10^{51}$erg. The temporal dependence of the flux during its rising phase is determined by the radial stratification structure, which determines the rate at which outflow energy is deposited in the ISM. This is in contrast with highly relativistic, $\gamma\approx100$, structured jet models, where the angular jet structure determines the time dependence through the gradual "unveiling" by deceleration of larger angular sections of the jet (which are initially "hidden" by relativistic beaming), typically leading to a predicted flux decline after the peak that is faster than observed. Our model predicts a dependence on the observing angle, which is different than that predicted by highly relativistic jet models. Particularly, similar merger events observed closer to the symmetry axis are predicted to show a similarly extended duration of flux increase with time. Our analysis demonstrates that the data do not require a highly relativistic $\gamma\approx100$ component, but the presence of such a component with opening angle $\ll0.2$~rad and energy $\ll10^{51}$~erg cannot be excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for life beyond the Solar System remains a primary goal of current and near-future missions, including NASA's upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). However, research into determining the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets has been primarily focused on comparisons to modern-day Earth. Additionally, current characterization strategies focus on the unpolarized flux from these worlds, taking into account only a fraction of the informational content of the reflected light. Better understanding the changes in the reflected light spectrum of the Earth throughout its evolution, as well as analyzing its polarization, will be crucial for mapping its habitability and providing comparison templates to potentially habitable exoplanets. Here we present spectropolarimetric models of the reflected light from the Earth at six epochs across all four geologic eons. We find that the changing surface albedos and atmospheric gas concentrations across the different epochs allow the habitable and non-habitable scenarios to be distinguished, and diagnostic features of clouds and hazes are more noticeable in the polarized signals. We show that common simplifications for exoplanet modeling, including Mie scattering for fractal particles, affect the resulting planetary signals and can lead to non-physical features. Finally, our results suggest that pushing the HWO planet-to-star flux contrast limit down to 1 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ could allow for the characterization in both unpolarized and polarized light of an Earth-like planet at any stage in its history.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore the SPE effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of the H$_2$ gas and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will quickly become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized incident electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. Low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned grains induced by CRs would cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light. We propose that amino acids and sugars of chiral assymmetry detected in meteorite/asteroids/comets might be formed in the ice mantle of grains under the irradiation of SPEs released from aligned grains by CRs in protostellar environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars end their life as core-collapse supernovae, amongst which some extremes are Type Ic broad-lined supernovae associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) having powerful relativistic jets. Their less-extreme brethren make unsuccessful jets that are choked inside the stars, appearing as X-ray flashes or low-luminosity GRBs. On the other hand, there exists a population of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) with timescales ranging from seconds to thousands of seconds, whose origins remain obscure. Known sources that contribute to the observed EFXT population include the softer analogs of LGRBs, shock breakouts of supernovae, or unsuccessful jets. Here, we report the discovery of the bright X-ray transient EP240414a detected by the Einstein Probe (EP), which is associated with the Type Ic supernova SN 2024gsa at a redshift of 0.401. The X-ray emission evolution is characterised by a very soft energy spectrum peaking at < 1.3 keV, which makes it distinct from known LGRBs, X-ray flashes, or low-luminosity GRBs. Follow-up observations at optical and radio bands revealed the existence of a weak relativistic jet that interacts with an extended shell surrounding the progenitor star. Located on the outskirts of a massive galaxy, this event reveals a new population of explosions of Wolf-Rayet stars characterised by a less powerful engine that drives a successful but weak jet, possibly owing to a progenitor star with a smaller core angular momentum than in traditional LGRB progenitors.
#### Recovery of coronal dimmings

 - **Abstract**
 Coronal dimmings are regions of reduced emission in the lower corona, observed after coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and representing their footprints. In order to investigate the long-term evolution of coronal dimming and its recovery, we propose two approaches that focus on both the global and the local evolution of dimming regions: the fixed mask approach and the pixel boxes approach. We present four case studies (September 6, 2011; March 7, 2012; June 14, 2012; and March 8, 2019) in which a coronal dimming is associated with a flare/CME eruption. We identified the dimming region by image segmentation, then restricted the analysis to a specific portion of the dimming and tracked the time evolution of the dimming brightness and area. In addition, we studied the behavior of small subregions inside the dimming area, of about 3x3 pixels, to compare the recovery in different regions of the dimming. Three out of the four cases show a complete recovery 24 hours after the flare/CME eruption. The recovery of the brightness follows a two-step trend, with a steeper and quicker segment followed by a slower one. In addition, some parts of the dimming, which may be core dimmings, are still present at the end of the analysis time and do not recover within 3 days, whereas the peripheral regions (secondary dimmings) show a full recovery. We demonstrate that the primary mechanism for recovery identified in the observations is the expansion of coronal loops into the dimming region, which gradually increase their intensity. Our developed approaches enable the analysis of dimmings alongside these bright structures, revealing different timescales of recovery for core and secondary/twin dimming regions. Combined with magnetic field modeling, these methods lay the foundation for further systematic analysis of dimming recovery and enhance the knowledge gained from already-analyzed events.
#### Magnetic evolution of active regions: formation and eruption of magnetic flux ropes

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic flux ropes (FRs) are twisted structures appearing on the sun, predominantly in the magnetically concentrated regions. These structures appear as coronal features known as filaments or prominences in H$\alpha$ observations, and as sigmoids in X-ray, EUV observations. Using the continuous vector magnetic field observations from \textit{Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} onboard \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we study the evolution of the magnetic fields in the active regions (ARs) to understand the conditions of twisted flux formation. While ARs emerge and evolve further, flux motions such as shearing and rotation are efficient mechanisms to form twisted flux ropes. Magnetic helicity quantifies the twisted magnetic fields and helicity injection through photosphere leads to its accumulation in the corona. Therefore, coronal helicity accumulation leads to twisted FR formation and its eruption. The magnetic helicity injection is seen to evolve distinctly in the regions of flux rope formation and eruption. The ARs that are associated with eruptive activity are observed with helicity injection predominantly with one sign over a period of a few days. The ARs that inject helicity with a changing sign are unlikely to form twisted FRs because coronal helicity during the period of one sign of injected helicity gets cancelled by the opposite sign of injection in the later period. As a result, the coronal field reconfigures from shared to potential structure. For a given AR, the upper limit of helicity that could cause a CME eruption is not yet understood, which can be the subject of future studies of ARs. Magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in both the initiation and driving of FR eruptions after their formation. Data-driven simulations of the AR evolution provide more insights on the flux rope formation and its onset of eruption.
#### Leaning Sideways: VHS 1256-1257 b is a Super-Jupiter with a Uranus-like Obliquity

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain the angular momentum architecture of VHS J125601.92-125723.9, a 140 $\pm$ 20 Myr old hierarchical triple system composed of a low-mass binary and a widely-separated planetary-mass companion VHS 1256 b. VHS 1256 b has been a prime target for multiple characterization efforts, revealing the highest measured substellar photometric variability to date and the presence of silicate clouds and disequilibrium chemistry. Here we add a key piece to the characterization of this super-Jupiter on a Tatooine-like orbit; we measure its spin-axis tilt relative to its orbit, i.e. the obliquity of VHS 1256 b. We accomplish this by combining three measurements. We find a projected rotation rate $v \sin{i_p} = 8.7 \pm 0.1 \,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ for VHS 1256 b using near-IR high-resolution spectra from Gemini/IGRINS. Combining this with a published photometric rotation period indicates that the companion is viewed edge-on, with a line-of-sight spin axis inclination of $i_{\rm p} = 90^\circ \pm 18^\circ$. We refit available astrometry measurements to confirm an orbital inclination of $i_{\rm o} = 23 \substack{+10 \\ -13}^\circ$. Taken together, VHS 1256 b has a large planetary obliquity of $\psi = 90^\circ \pm 25^\circ$. In total, we have three measured angular momentum vectors for the system: the binary orbit normal, companion orbit normal, and companion spin axis. All three are misaligned with respect to each other. Although VHS 1256 b is tilted like Uranus, their origins are distinct. We rule out planet-like scenarios including collisions and spin-orbit resonances, and suggest that top-down formation via core/filament fragmentation is promising.
#### Extinction of Taurus, Orion, Perseus and California Molecular Clouds Based on the LAMOST, 2MASS, and Gaia Surveys II: The Extinction Law

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02731

 - **Abstract**
 The extinction law from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) (0.2-24 $\mu$m) is determined by relying on the blue-edge method and color excess ratios for some nearby molecular clouds, from low mass star forming region to massive star forming region. The observational data are collected from nine photometric surveys, along with stellar parameters from the APOGEE and LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Within the uncertainties, the optical ratio of selective to total extinction ($R_{G_{BP}}$) does not vary substantially across the clouds, irrespective of the density, specifically $R_{G_{BP}} =2.302\pm0.027$, where $R_{G_{BP}} \equiv A_{G_{BP}}/E_{G_{BP},G_{RP}}$. The IR extinction law is consistent with \citet{Wang19_law}. The extinction law in the UV band is compromised by the shallow depth with $A_{V} \leq 2$ mag and is hard to describe by one parameter $R$. In addition, the extinction in the WISE/W1 band is significantly larger than in the Spitzer/IRAC1 band in the dense regions, which is attributed to the ice water absorption.
