 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star (NS) mergers are currently the only observed source of r-process production in the Universe. Yet, it is unclear how much r-process mass from these mergers is incorporated into star-forming gas to enrich stars. This is crucial to consider as all other r-process mass estimates in the Universe beyond Earth are based on stellar r-process abundances. Here, we explore the extent to which merger location and host galaxy properties affect the incorporation of r-process elements into star-forming gas, and quantify an ``enrichment" timescale to account for this process. To put this timescale in context, we analyze a population of 12 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with probable associations to r-process kilonovae (GRB-KNe) and 74 short GRBs without claimed KNe, including new non-parametric star formation histories for the GRB-KN hosts. We find enrichment timescales for this sample are between ~7 Myr-1.6 Gyr, suggesting that environmental enrichment is delayed from NS merger occurrence. Moreover, we find a correlation between the amount of environmental enrichment from a single event and increasing host specific star formation rate (sSFR), and little correlation with stellar mass and GRB galactocentric offset. Environments with low sSFRs (<10^-10.5 yr^-1), which comprise 18% of short GRB hosts and the host of GW170817, will have little to no capacity for enrichment. Our results indicate that not all r-process from NS mergers enriches star-forming gas, and instead some is lost to the CGM or IGM. Future studies should consider these losses to understand the total contribution from NS mergers to the Universe's r-process budget.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel, model-independent technique for fitting the cross-component of weak lensing shear, $\gamma_\times$, along a line of sight by combining kinematic and photometric measurements of a single lensed galaxy. Rather than relying on parametric models, we fit for the shear parameter that best transforms the velocity field to restore its underlying symmetries, while also incorporating photometric data for the change in position angle due to shear. We first validate our technique with idealized mock data, exploring the method's response to variations in shear, position angle, inclination, and noise. On this idealized mock data, our combined kinematic and photometric model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional parametric or kinematic-only approaches. Subsequently, we apply our method to a dataset of 358 halos from the Illustris TNG simulations, achieving a notable reduction in the uncertainty of $\gamma_\times$ to 0.039, marking a substantial improvement over previous analysis of the dataset with a parametric model. Finally, we introduce an outlier rejection method based on Moran's I-test for spatial autocorrelation. Identifying and filtering out halos with spatially correlated residuals reduces the overall uncertainty to 0.028. Our results underscore the efficacy of combining kinematic and photometric data for weak lensing studies, providing a more precise and targeted measurement of shear along an individual line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 In the third APOKASC catalog, we present data for the complete sample of 15,808 evolved stars with APOGEE spectroscopic parameters and Kepler asteroseismology. We used ten independent asteroseismic analysis techniques and anchor our system on fundamental radii derived from Gaia $L$ and spectroscopic $T_{\rm eff}$. We provide evolutionary state, asteroseismic surface gravity, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them for 12,418 stars. This includes 10,036 exceptionally precise measurements, with median fractional uncertainties in \nmax, \dnu, mass, radius and age of 0.6\%, 0.6\%, 3.8\%, 1.8\%, and 11.1\% respectively. We provide more limited data for 1,624 additional stars which either have lower quality data or are outside of our primary calibration domain. Using lower red giant branch (RGB) stars, we find a median age for the chemical thick disk of $9.14 \pm 0.05 ({\rm ran}) \pm 0.9 ({\rm sys})$ Gyr with an age dispersion of 1.1 Gyr, consistent with our error model. We calibrate our red clump (RC) mass loss to derive an age consistent with the lower RGB and provide asymptotic GB and RGB ages for luminous stars. We also find a sharp upper age boundary in the chemical thin disk. We find that scaling relations are precise and accurate on the lower RGB and RC, but they become more model dependent for more luminous giants and break down at the tip of the RGB. We recommend the usage of multiple methods, calibration to a fundamental scale, and the usage of stellar models to interpret frequency spacings.
#### SILCC -- VIII: The impact of far-ultraviolet radiation on star formation and the interstellar medium

 - **Abstract**
 We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star formation in the multiphase interstellar medium to quantify the impact of non-ionising far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. This study is carried out within the framework of the \textsc{Silcc Project}. It incorporates the radiative transfer of ionising radiation and self-consistent modelling of variable FUV radiation from star clusters. Near young star clusters, the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) can reach values of $G_0 \approx 10^4$ (in Habing units), far exceeding the canonical solar neighbourhood value of $G_0 = 1.7$. However, our findings suggest that FUV radiation has minimal impact on the integrated star formation rate compared to other feedback mechanisms such as ionising radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. Only a slight decrease in star formation burstiness, related to increased photoelectric heating efficiency by the variable FUV radiation field, is detectable. Dust near star-forming regions can be heated up to 60 K via the photoelectric (PE) effect, showing a broad temperature distribution. PE heating rates for variable FUV radiation models show higher peak intensities but lower average heating rates than static ISRF models. Simulations of solar neighbourhood conditions without stellar winds or ionising radiation but with self-consistent ISRF and supernovae show high star formation rates $\sim10^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$, contradicting expectations. Our chemical analysis reveals increased cold neutral medium volume-filling factors (VFF) outside the vicinity of stellar clusters with a variable ISRF. Simultaneously, the thermally unstable gas is reduced, and a sharper separation of warm and cold gas phases is observed. The variable FUV field also promotes a diffuse molecular gas phase with VFF of $\sim5-10$~per cent.

 - **Abstract**
 It is possible for asymmetric dark matter (ADM) to accumulate in neutron star interiors and affect their global properties. Considering the effects of this accumulation, neutron star mass-radius measurements can deliver new insights into the cold dense matter equation of state (EoS). In this paper, we employ Bayesian parameter estimation using real and synthetic neutron star mass-radius data to infer constraints on the combined baryonic matter and fermionic ADM EoS, where the fermionic ADM forms a core in the neutron star interior. Using currently available mass-radius data, we find that the lower bound of the ratio between ADM effective self-repulsion strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi$) and particle mass ($m_\chi$) can be constrained at the 68% (95%) credible level to $10^{-6.59}$ ($10^{-7.36}$). We also find that, if neutron star mass-radius measurement uncertainties are reduced to the 2% level, the constraints on lower bound on the ratio of $g_\chi/m_\phi$ to $m_\chi$ can be improved to $10^{-6.5}$ and $10^{-7.29}$ at the 68% and 95% credible levels, respectively. However, all other combinations, of $m_\chi$, $g_\chi$, and the ADM mass-fraction, $F_\chi$, (i.e., the ratio of the gravitational ADM mass to the gravitational mass of the neutron star) are unconstrained. Furthermore, in the pressure-energy density and mass-radius planes, the inferences which include the possibility of fermionic ADM cores are nearly identical with the inferences that neglect fermionic ADM for $F_\chi \leq 1.7\%$ and neutron star mass-radius uncertainties $\geq 2\%$. Therefore, we find that neutron star mass-radius measurements can constrain ADM in some scenarios and that the presence of ADM in neutron star cores is as equally consistent with current data as the absence of ADM.

 - **Abstract**
 Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.

 - **Abstract**
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thought to be the most abundant class of molecules in space, yet their interstellar lifecycle is poorly understood due to difficulties detecting individual PAHs. Here, we present the discovery of 1-cyanopyrene, a 4-ring PAH, in the dense cloud TMC-1 using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope. We derive an abundance of ~1.52 x 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, estimating that pyrene accounts for up to 0.03-0.3% of the carbon in TMC-1 and up to 1% within comets. Our findings agree with analysis of pyrene from asteroid Ryugu, which suggests a cold, interstellar origin. The abundance indicates pyrene is an "island of stability" in interstellar PAH chemistry, and suggests that the carbon supplied to planetary systems, carried by PAHs, originates in cold clouds.
#### Energy equipartition in Globular Clusters through the eyes of dynamical models

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational encounters drive globular clusters toward energy equipartition, mass segregation and evaporation altering structural, spatial and kinematic features. We determine the dynamical state of a few globular clusters by means of a multi-mass King-like dynamical model, focusing on the energy equipartition degree and its relation with model parameters. We fit the observed velocity dispersion, as derived from HST proper motion data, as a function of the stellar mass $\sigma(m)$, to estimate the parameter $\Phi_0$, a measure of the gravitational potential well. The same fit is repeated by means of the Bianchini relation, providing the equipartition mass $m_\mathrm{eq}$. The relationship between $\Phi_0$ and $m_\mathrm{eq}$ has been studied and the structural properties, such as concentration $c$, number of core relaxation timescales $N_\mathrm{core}$ and core radius $r_\mathrm{c}$, are discussed. To obtain an independent estimate of $\Phi_0$, we fit observed surface brightness profiles by using the predicted surface density and a mass-luminosity relation from isochrones. The quality of the fits on $\sigma(m)$ obtained by means of our dynamical model is comparable to those obtained with the Bianchini function. Nonetheless, when the Bianchini function is used to fit the projected velocity dispersion, the resulting degree of equipartition is underestimated. On the contrary, our approach provides the equipartition degree at any radial or projected distance by means of $\Phi_0$. As a result, a cluster in a more advanced dynamical state shows a larger $\Phi_0$, as well as larger $N_\mathrm{core}$ and $c$, while $r_\mathrm{c}$ decreases. The estimates of $\Phi_0$ obtained by fitting surface brightness profiles result compatible at $2\sigma$ confidence level with those from internal kinematics, although further investigation of statistical and systematic errors is required.
#### Exploring the catastrophic regime: thermodynamics and disintegration in head-on planetary collisions

 - **Abstract**
 Head-on giant impacts (collisions between planet-size bodies) are frequently used to study the planet formation process as they present an extreme configuration where the two colliding bodies are greatly disturbed. With limited computing resources, focusing on these extreme impacts eases the burden of exploring a large parameter space. Results from head-on impacts are often then extended to study oblique impacts with angle corrections or used as initial conditions for other calculations, for example, the evolution of ejected debris. In this study, we conduct a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic and energy budget evolution of high-energy head-on giant impacts, entering the catastrophic impacts regime, for target masses between 0.001 and 12 M$_{\oplus}$. We demonstrate the complex interplay of gravitational forces, shock dynamics, and thermodynamic processing in head-on impacts at high energy. Our study illustrates that frequent interactions of core material with the liquid side of the vapour curve could have cumulative effects on the post-collision remnants, leading to fragmentary disintegration occurring at lower impact energy. This results in the mass of the largest remnant diverging significantly from previously developed scaling laws. These findings suggest two key considerations: 1) head-on planetary collisions for different target masses do not behave similarly, so caution is needed when applying scaling laws across a broad parameter space; 2) an accurate model of the liquid-vapour phase boundary is essential for modeling giant impacts. Our findings highlight the need for careful consideration of impact configurations in planetary formation studies, as head-on impacts involve a complex interplay between thermodynamic processing, shocks, gravitational forces, and other factors.
