 - **Abstract**
 We present a first two-dimensional general-relativistic analysis of superconducting regions in axially symmetric highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) models with toroidal magnetic fields. We investigate the topology and distribution of type-II and type-I superconducting regions for varying toroidal magnetic field strengths and stellar masses by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations using the XNS code. Our results reveal that the outer cores of low- to intermediate-mass magnetars sustain superconductivity over larger regions compared to higher-mass stars with non-trivial distribution of type-II and type-I regions. Consistent with previous one-dimensional (1D) models, we find that regardless of the gravitational mass, the inner cores of magnetars with toroidal magnetic fields are devoid of $S$-wave proton superconductivity. Furthermore, these models contain non-superconducting, torus-shaped regions - a novel feature absent in previous 1D studies. Finally, we speculate on the potential indirect effects of superconductivity on continuous gravitational wave emissions from millisecond pulsars, such as PSR J1843-1113, highlighting their relevance for future gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 The inner Solar System is depleted in refractory carbon in comparison to the interstellar medium and the depletion likely took place in the protoplanetary disk phase of the Solar System. We study the effect of photolysis of refractory carbon in the upper layers of the protosolar disk and its interplay with dust collisional growth and vertical mixing. We make use of a 1D Monte Carlo model to simulate dust coagulation and vertical mixing. To model the FUV flux of the disk, we use a simple analytical prescription and benchmark it with data from a radiative transfer simulation. We study the effects of fragmentation and bouncing on dust distribution and the propagation of carbon depletion. We find that when bouncing is included, the size distribution is truncated at smaller sizes than fragmentation-limited size distributions but there is a loss of small grains as well. The population of small grains is reduced due to fewer fragmentation events and this reduces the effectiveness of photolysis. We find that dust collisional growth and vertical mixing increase the effectiveness of carbon depletion by efficiently replenishing carbon to the upper regions of the disk with higher FUV flux. It takes around 100-300 kyr to reach the measured carbon abundances at 1 au, depending on the strength of the turbulence in the disk. These timescales are faster than reported by previous studies. Collisional redistribution and turbulent mixing are important aspects of dust evolution that should be included when modeling dust chemistry as they can influence the efficiency of chemical processes. Photolysis, along with another process such as sublimation, most likely played a key role in refractory carbon depletion that we see around us in the inner Solar System.
#### The Bulge Cluster Origin (BulCO) survey at the ESO-VLT: probing the early history of the Milky Way assembling. Design and first results in Liller1

 - **Abstract**
 We present the scientific goals and the very first results of the Bulge Cluster Origin (BulCO) survey. This survey has been specifically designed to perform an unprecedented chemical screening of stellar systems orbiting the Milky Way bulge, with the aim to unveil their true origin. It takes advantage of the improved performances of the spectrograph CRIRES+ operating at the ESO Very Large telescope, in the near-infrared domain. Due to the complex evolutionary history of the Milky Way, a variety of relics tracing different phenomena is expected to populate the Bulge: globular clusters formed in-situ or accreted from outside the Galaxy, nuclear star clusters of cannibalized structures, and possibly a few remnants of the proto-bulge formation process (the so-called ``bulge fossil fragments"). The signatures of the different origins are imprinted in the chemical properties of these stellar systems because specific abundance patterns provide authentic "chemical DNA" tests univocally tracing the enrichment process and, therefore, the environment where the stellar population formed. Thus, each system can provide a new piece of information on the bulge formation and evolutionary history. As first results of the survey, here we discuss the alpha-element and iron abundances of a sample of stars observed in the stellar system Liller 1, which is proposed to be a bulge fossil fragment. By combining this dataset with a recently published sample of high/mid-resolution spectra, we discuss the overall chemical properties of the stellar populations in Liller1, proving its link with the Galactic bulge and providing new constraints on its star formation history.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass loss governs the evolution of massive stars and shapes the stellar surroundings. To quantify the impact of the stellar winds we need to know the exact mass-loss rates; however, empirical constraints on the rates are hampered by limited knowledge of their small-scale wind structure or 'wind clumping'. We aim to improve empirical constraints on the mass loss of massive stars by investigating the clumping properties of their winds, in particular the relation between stellar parameters and wind structure. We analyse the optical and ultraviolet spectra of 25 O-type (super)giants in the LMC, using the model atmosphere code Fastwind and a genetic algorithm. We derive stellar and wind parameters including detailed clumping properties, such as the amount of clumping, the density of the interclump medium, velocity-porosity of the medium, and wind turbulence. We obtain stellar and wind parameters for 24 of our sample stars and find that the winds are highly clumped, with an average clumping factor of $f_{\rm cl}=33\pm14$, an interclump density factor of $f_{\rm ic}=0.2\pm0.1$, and moderate to strong velocity-porosity effects. The scatter around the average values of the wind-structure parameters is large. With the exception of a significant, positive correlation between the interclump density factor and mass loss, we find no dependence of clumping parameters on either mass-loss rate or stellar properties. In the luminosity range that we investigate, the empirical and theoretical mass-loss rates both have a scatter of about 0.5~dex, or a factor 3. Within this uncertainty, the empirical rates and the theoretical predictions agree. The origin of the scatter of the empirical mass-loss rates requires further investigation. It is possible that our description of wind clumping is still not sufficient to capture effects of the structured wind; this could contribute to the scatter.

 - **Abstract**
 The {\em B}-field Orion Protostellar Survey (BOPS) recently obtained polarimetric observations at 870 ${\rm \mu m}$ towards 61 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds with $\sim 1^{\prime\prime}$ spatial resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. From the BOPS sample, we selected the 26 protostars with extended polarized emission within a radius of $\sim 6^{\prime\prime}$ (2400~au) around the protostar. This allows to have sufficient statistical polarization data to infer the magnetic field strength. The magnetic field strength is derived using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The underlying magnetic field strengths are approximately 2.0~mG for protostars with a standard hourglass magnetic field morphology, which is higher than the values derived for protostars with rotated hourglass, spiral, and complex magnetic field configurations ($\lesssim1.0$~mG). This suggests that the magnetic field plays a more significant role in envelopes exhibiting a standard hourglass field morphology, and a value of $\gtrsim2.0$ mG would be required to maintain such a structure at these scales. Furthermore, most protostars in the sample are slightly supercritical, with mass-to-flux ratios $\lesssim3.0$. In particular, the mass-to-flux ratios for all protostars with a standard hourglass magnetic field morphology are lower than 3.0. However, these ratios do not account for the contribution of the protostellar mass, which means they are likely significantly underestimated.
#### IMF slope derived from a pure probabilistic model

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function is of great significance for the study of star formation and galactic structure. Observations indicate that the IMF follows a power-law form. This work derived that when the expected number of stars formed from a spherical molecular cloud is much greater than 1, there is a relationship between the slope $\alpha$ of the IMF and $r^n$ in the radius-density relation of spherically symmetric gas clouds, given by $\alpha = 3/(n+3)$ ($\Gamma_{\mathrm {IMF}} = n/(n+3)$). This conclusion is close to the results of numerical simulations and observations, but it is derived from a pure probabilistic model, which may have underlying reasons worth pondering.
#### Stellar $β^{-}$-decay rate of $^{63}$Ni and its impact on the ${s}$-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 The $\beta^{-}$-decay rate of $^{63}$Ni, an important branching point, affects the subsequent nucleosynthesis in the weak component of the slow-neutron capture process (weak $s$-process). To evaluate the impact of the uncertainties of stellar lifetime of $^{63}$Ni on abundances, we calculate the contribution to $\beta^{-}$-decay rates from its excited states using the large-scale shell model with various interactions and also explore the atomic effects in the highly ionized plasma. In the core He burning stage and the shell C burning stage of massive stars, our new rates can be larger than those from Takahashi and Yokoi(1987) by up to a factor of 4 and 6, respectively. We evaluate the impact of the stellar decay rates of $^{63}$Ni on the nucleosynthesis of $A=60\sim90$ in a star with an initial mass of 25 $M_{\bigodot}$ and solar metalicity. We find that the new rates can lead to the abundance changes of $^{64}$Ni, $^{63}$Cu, $^{65}$Cu, $^{64}$Zn, $^{66}$Zn, $^{67}$Zn, and $^{68}$Zn by up to $18\%$, $14\%$, $7\%$, $98\%$, $16\%$, $15\%$, and $13\%$, respectively, after the shell C burning stage at the Lagrangian mass coordinate $M_{r}=2M_{\bigodot}$. The enhancement of the decay rate of $^{63}$Ni increases the weak $s$-process efficiency of nuclei after $^{65}$Cu.
#### Optical and Near-Infrared Contemporaneous Polarimetry of C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted contemporaneous optical and near-infrared polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, hereafter T-A) from 2024 October 16 to December 17, covering a wide range of phase angles (20-123 deg) and wavelength (0.5-2.3 um). We paid special attention to gas contamination in the dust polarization using these data. As a result, we find the maximum polarization degree $P_max=31.21 +- 0.05 %, 33.52 +- 0.06 %, 35.12 +- 0.01 %, 37.57 +- 0.01 %, and 35.35 +- 0.01 % in the Rc-, Ic-, J-, H-, and Ks-bands, respectively. Although dust polarization shows a red slope at shorter wavelengths and can peak around 1.6 um, the phase angle at which maximum polarization occurs exhibits less dependence on wavelength (alpha_max ~ 90 deg - 95 deg). Although only a few historically bright comets, such as West, Halley, and Hale-Bopp, have undergone such extensive dust-polarization observations, our measurements are generally consistent with those of two comets that possibly originated from the Oort Cloud (West and Halley). From these results, we conjecture that the optical properties and growth processes of dust in the presolar nebula, which formed these cometary nuclei, were likely uniform.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of a spatially compete, high-sensitivity survey for Herbig-Haro (HH) outflows in the Western and Eastern Circinus molecular clouds. We have detected 28 new HH objects in Circinus West, doubling the number known in this dark nebula. We have also discovered 9 outflows in Circinus East, the first to be identified here. Although both Circinus West and East appear to be located at ~800 pc, their morphologies are distinct. Circinus West shows filamentary structure, while Circinus East is dominated by amorphous dark clouds. North-east of Circinus East, an extended distribution of young stars is centered on the ~6 Myr-old open cluster ASCC 79, which may have triggered the sequential formation of younger surrounding populations. New transverse velocities from Gaia show two dynamically distinct stellar populations in Circinus East; their velocity distribution is consistent with an active cloud-cloud collision between material ejected by the formation of O and B stars in ASCC~79 and a dynamically similar interloping cloud. Given the similar distances to Circinus West and East, and the presence in both of HH objects -- a phenomenon associated with stellar ages of ~1 Myr -- it is likely that these clouds are nominally related, but only Circinus East is subject to substantial feedback from the central cluster in the parent complex. This feedback appears to guide the morphology and evolution of Circinus East, resulting in a complex and possibly disruptive dynamical environment rich in star formation potential that contrasts with the relatively quiescent environment in Circinus West.
#### SOFIA FIFI-LS spectroscopy of DR21 Main: energetics of the spatially-resolved outflow from a high-mass protostar

 - **Abstract**
 Massive star formation is associated with energetic processes that may influence the physics and chemistry of parental molecular clouds and impact galaxy evolution. The high-mass protostar DR21 Main in Cygnus X possesses one of the largest and most luminous outflows ever detected in the Galaxy, but the origin of its structure and driving mechanisms is still debated. Our aim is to spatially resolve the far-infrared line emission from DR21 Main and to investigate the gas physical conditions, energetics, and current mass loss rates along its outflow. Far-infrared SOFIA FIFI-LS spectra covering selected high-J CO lines, OH, [O I], [CII] and [O III] lines are analyzed across the almost full extent of the DR21 Main outflow using 2.00' x 3.75' mosaic. The spatial extent of far-infrared emission follows closely the well-known outflow direction of DR21 Main in case of high-J CO, [O I] 63.18 um, and the OH line at 163.13 um. On the contrary, the emission from the [C II] 157.74 um and [O I] 145.53 um lines arises mostly from the eastern part of the outflow, and it is likely linked with a photodissociation region. Comparison of non-LTE radiative transfer models with the observed [O I] line ratios suggest H2 densities of ~10^5 cm^(-3) in the western part of the outflow and ~10^4 cm^(-3) in the East. Such densities are consistent with the predictions of UV-irradiated non-dissociative shock models for the observed ratios of CO and [O I] along the DR21 Main. Main outflow. Assuming that the bulk of emission arises in shocks, the outflow power of DR21 Main of 4.3-4.8x10^2 Lsol and the mass-loss rate of 3.3-3.7x10^(-3) Msol/yr are determined. Observations provide strong support for its origin in outflow shocks, and the stratification of physical conditions along the outflow. The total line cooling provides additional evidence that DR21 Main drives one of the most energetic outflows in the Milky Way.
#### Probing the physical environment of the most high-redshift H$_2$-DLAs through numerical models

 - **Abstract**
 Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) with molecular hydrogen have been probed in detail through both spectroscopic observations and numerical modelling. However, such H$_2$ absorbers are quite sparse at very high redshifts. We identify six of the most distant known H$_2$-DLAs (redshift between 3 and 4.5), with medium/high-resolution spectroscopic observations reported in the literature, and perform detailed numerical modelling followed by Bayesian analysis to constrain their physical properties mainly using the H$_2$ rotational level population and CI fine structure levels. Our modelling approach involves setting up a constant-pressure multiphase cloud irradiated from both sides, in comparison to most models which employ constant density. This enables us to use all observed atomic and molecular species as constraints to build a more realistic model of the DLA. Our results indicate high interstellar radiation field strength $\sim$ 10$^2$ to 10$^3$ G$_0$ for some sightlines, which is suggestive of in situ star formation. The cosmic ray ionization rate for all DLAs is constrained between 10$^{-17}$ and 10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, consistent with recent estimates for high-redshift sightlines. Total hydrogen density and temperature lie in the ranges 50 to 4 $\times$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and 35-200 K in the innermost part of the absorbers. The corresponding gas pressure in our DLA models lies between 10$^{3.5}$ and 10$^{6.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ K, with three sightlines having a higher pressure than the range typical of high-redshift H$_2$-DLAs.
#### Comparison of the earliest NC and CC planetesimals: Evidence from ungrouped iron meteorites

 - **Abstract**
 Isotope anomalies in meteorites reveal a fundamental dichotomy between non-carbonaceous- (NC) and carbonaceous-type (CC) planetary bodies. Until now, this dichotomy is established for the major meteorite groups, representing about 36 distinct parent bodies. Ungrouped meteorites represent an even larger number of additional and so far mostly unexplored parent bodies. Here, the genetics and chronology of 26 ungrouped iron meteorites are investigated. The ungrouped irons confirm the NC-CC dichotomy for Mo, where NC and CC meteorites define two distinct, subparallel s-process mixing lines. All ungrouped NC irons fall on the NC-line, which is now precisely defined for 41 distinct parent bodies. The ungrouped CC irons show scatter around the CC-line indicative of small r-process Mo heterogeneities among these samples. These r-process Mo isotope variations correlate with O isotope anomalies, most likely reflecting mixing of CI chondrite-like matrix, chondrule precursors and Ca-Al-rich inclusions. This implies that CC iron meteorite parent bodies accreted the same nebular components as the later-formed carbonaceous chondrites. The Hf-W model ages of core formation for the ungrouped irons reveal a narrow age peak at ~3.3 Ma after Ca-Al-rich inclusions for the CC irons. By contrast, the NC irons display more variable ages, including younger ages indicative of impact-induced melting events, which seem absent among the CC irons. This is attributed to the more fragile and porous nature of the CC bodies, making impact-induced melting on their surfaces difficult. The chemical characteristics of all iron meteorites together reveal slightly more oxidizing conditions during core formation for CC compared to NC irons. More strikingly, strong depletions in moderately volatile elements, typical of many iron meteorite parent bodies, predominantly occur among CC irons.

 - **Abstract**
 The first Euclid Quick Data Release, Q1, comprises 63.1 sq deg of the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) to nominal wide-survey depth. It encompasses visible and near-infrared space-based imaging and spectroscopic data, ground-based photometry in the u, g, r, i and z bands, as well as corresponding masks. Overall, Q1 contains about 30 million objects in three areas near the ecliptic poles around the EDF-North and EDF-South, as well as the EDF-Fornax field in the constellation of the same name. The purpose of this data release -- and its associated technical papers -- is twofold. First, it is meant to inform the community of the enormous potential of the Euclid survey data, to describe what is contained in these data, and to help prepare expectations for the forthcoming first major data release DR1. Second, it enables a wide range of initial scientific projects with wide-survey Euclid data, ranging from the early Universe to the Solar System. The Q1 data were processed with early versions of the processing pipelines, which already demonstrate good performance, with numerous improvements in implementation compared to pre-launch development. In this paper, we describe the sky areas released in Q1, the observations, a top-level view of the data processing of Euclid and associated external data, the Q1 photometric masks, and how to access the data. We also give an overview of initial scientific results obtained using the Q1 data set by Euclid Consortium scientists, and conclude with important caveats when using the data. As a complementary product, Q1 also contains observations of a star-forming area in Lynd's Dark Nebula 1641 in the Orion~A Cloud, observed for technical purposes during Euclid's performance-verification phase. This is a unique target, of a type not commonly found in Euclid's nominal sky survey.
#### Connecting a Magnetized Disk to a Convective Low-mass Protostar: A Global Three-dimensional Model of Boundary Layer Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 In the early stages of star formation, boundary layer accretion, where protostars accrete material from disks extending down to their surfaces, plays a crucial role. Understanding how a magneto-rotational-instability (MRI)-active disk connects to a protostar's surface remains a significant challenge. To investigate the mechanisms of mass and angular momentum transfer, we develop a global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of boundary layer accretion around a magnetized, convective low-mass protostar. Our results reveal that angular momentum transport mechanisms transition significantly from the outer MRI-active disk to the protostellar surface. Various mechanisms--MRI, spiral shocks, coronal accretion, jets, and disk winds--contribute to angular momentum transfer, resulting in three distinct disk structures: (1) the MRI-active disk, (2) the transition layer, and (3) the boundary layer. The simulated protostar is strongly magnetized due to the accumulation of the disk fields, wrapping by disk toroidal fields, and stellar dynamo activity. Magnetic concentrations analogous to starspots form on the protostar and interact with the rotating disk gas to generate spiral shocks. These shocks play a key role in driving accretion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of global MHD models for a comprehensive understanding of angular momentum transport. Additionally, we identify explosive events triggered by magnetic reconnection in both the protostar and the disk atmosphere. We also find decretion flows in the disk midplane, which may be important for the radial transport of refractory materials, such as Calcium-Aluminium-rich Inclusions (CAIs) precursor gas, to the outer disk.

 - **Abstract**
 With a star formation rate of order 0.4 M$_\odot $ yr$^{-1}$, M31 should have significant population of supernova remnants (SNRs), and, in fact, 156 SNR and SNR candidates have been suggested by Lee et al. (2014) by searching for nebulae with elevated [SII]/H${\alpha}$ ratios in narrow band images. Here we use a combination of low and high resolution optical spectroscopy obtained with Hectospec on the MMT to characterize 152 of these nebulae. Of these candidates, we find 93 nebulae that have [SII]/H${\alpha}$ ratios that exceed 0.4, the traditional ratio used to separate SNRs from HII regions, strongly suggesting that at least these objects are SNRs. Our high resolution spectroscopy reveals 108 nebulae that have velocity widths in H${\alpha} $ (full-width at 20% peak flux) that exceed 50 km s$^{-1}$, significantly larger than found in HII regions. There are 72 objects that satisfy both tests. Here we discuss the spectroscopic characteristics of all of the objects in our sample, and the likelihood that other objects in the sample of Lee et al. are also SNRs, and we briefly consider confirmation by X-ray, radio and UV observations. We also discuss several new candidates that have been identified serendipitously in the course of examining a large amount of archival Hectospec data.

 - **Abstract**
 Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) directed at the Earth often drive large geomagnetic storms. Here we use velocity, magnetic field and proton density data from 152 CMEs that were sampled in-situ at 1 AU by the WIND spacecraft. We Fourier analyze fluctuations of these quantities in the quiescent pre-CME solar wind, sheath and magnetic cloud. We quantify the extent by which the power in turbulent (magnetic field, velocity and density) fluctuations in the sheath exceeds that in the solar wind background and in the magnetic cloud. For instance, the mean value of the power per unit volume in magnetic field fluctuations in the sheath is 76.7 times that in the solar wind background, while the mean value of the power per unit mass in velocity fluctuations in the sheath is 9 times that in the magnetic cloud. Our detailed results show that the turbulent fluctuation power is a useful discriminator between the ambient solar wind background, sheaths and magnetic clouds and can serve as a useful input for space weather prediction.
