#### Galactic Neutral Hydrogen Structures Spectroscopy and Kinematics: Designing a Home Radio Telescope for 21 cm Emission
 - **Authors:** Jack Phelps

Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00057

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00057

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents the methodology for creating a cost-efficient radio astronomy telescope that can be used to detect 21 cm emissions (1420.405 MHz) and determine the distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen specifically in the Milky Way. By measuring the Doppler shifts of the 21 cm emission, the velocities of hydrogen clouds relative to Earth can be determined. This enables the identification of these clouds' movements, their positions within the galaxy's spiral arms, and their roles in the overall rotational dynamics of the Milky Way. The setup is designed to be accessible to amateurs, enabling others to conduct similar projects. The measurement apparatus consists of a 1-meter parabolic dish, a H1-LNA for 21 cm emissions, an SDR, and a Raspberry Pi. This paper also provides an overview of the data processing required to detect the hydrogen line and generate velocity profiles. Additionally, it examines RFI mitigation techniques, such as spectral filtering and instrument shielding, which enhance observational clarity even in urban environments like Los Angeles. This study also analyzes the observed velocities of different galactic arms, as well as measurements across the sky.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the Baryon Pasted (BP) X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps derived from the half-sky Uchuu Lightcone simulation. These BP-Uchuu maps are constructed using more than $75$ million dark matter halos with masses $M_{500c} \geq 10^{13} M_\odot$ within the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 2$. A distinctive feature of our BP-Uchuu Lightcone maps is their capability to assess the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic scatter caused by triaxial gaseous halos and internal gas characteristics, respectively, at the map level. We show that triaxial gas drives substantial scatter in X-ray luminosities of clusters and groups, accounting for nearly half of the total scatter in core-excised measurements. Additionally, scatter in the thermal pressure and gas density profiles of halos enhances the X-ray and SZ power spectra, leading to biases in cosmological parameter estimates. These findings are statistically robust due to the extensive sky coverage and large halo sample in the BP-Uchuu maps.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observations of the high-mass star-forming region S255IR, which harbors the $\sim$20 M$_\odot$ protostar NIRS3, where a disk-mediated accretion burst was recorded several years ago, with the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas, which corresponds to $\sim$25 au and is almost an order of magnitude better than in the previous studies of this object. The observations were performed with ALMA at a wavelength of 0.9 mm in continuum and in several molecular lines. In the continuum we detected the central bright source (brightness temperature $\sim$850 K) elongated along the jet direction and two pairs of bright knots in the jet lobes. These pairs of knots imply a double ejection from NIRS3 with the time interval of $\sim$1.5 years. The orientation of the jet differs by $\sim$20$^\circ$ from that on larger scales, as mentioned also in some other recent works. The 0.9 mm continuum emission of the central source represents a mixture of the dust thermal emission and free-free emission of the ionized gas. Properties of the free-free emission are typical for hypercompact H II regions. In the continuum emission of the knots in the jet the free-free component apparently dominates. In the molecular lines a sub-Keplerian disk around NIRS3 about 400 au in diameter is observed. The absorption features in the molecular lines towards the central bright source may indicate an infall. The molecular line emission appears very inhomogeneous at small scales, which may indicate a small-scale clumpiness in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The sulfur content in dense molecular regions of the interstellar medium is highly depleted in comparison to diffuse clouds. The reason of this phenomenon is unclear, thus it is necessary to carry out observational studies of sulfur-bearing species towards dense regions, mainly at early evolutive stages to uncover the early sulfur chemistry. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we investigated a sample of 37 dense cores embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Lines of 34SO, SO2, NS, SO, SO+, and H2CS were analyzed and column densities of each molecular species were obtained. From the continuum emission, and two CH3OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and temperature, and the corresponding H2 column densities were derived. The abundances of such sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find that the abundances of the analyzed species increase with the growth of the gas temperature, suggesting that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of the analyzed molecule may have a similar dependence with Tk in the range 20 to 100 K. We find that the comparisons among abundances are, in general, highly correlated. Given that such correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we suggest that the sulfur-bearing species here analyzed should have a similar chemical origin. From the measured line widths we point out that molecules with oxygen content (34SO, SO2, SO, and SO+) may be associated with warmer and more turbulent gas than the other ones. H2CS and NS are associated with more quiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores. This work gives quantitative information about abundances that could be useful in chemical models pointing to explain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium.
#### Probing magneto-ionic microstructure towards the Vela pulsar using a prototype SKA-Low station

 - **Abstract**
 The Vela pulsar (J0835-4510) is known to exhibit variations in Faraday rotation and dispersion on multi-decade timescales due to the changing sightline through the surrounding Vela supernova remnant and the Gum Nebula. Until now, variations in Faraday rotation towards Vela have not been studied on timescales less than around a decade. We present the results of a high-cadence observing campaign carried out with the Aperture Array Verification System 2 (AAVS2), a prototype SKA-Low station, which received a significant bandwidth upgrade in 2022. We collected observations of the Vela pulsar and PSR J0630-2834 (a nearby pulsar located outside the Gum Nebula), spanning $\sim 1\,\mathrm{yr}$ and $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{yr}$ respectively, and searched for linear trends in the rotation measure (RM) as a function of time. We do not detect any significant trends on this timescale ($\sim$months) for either pulsar, but the constraints could be greatly improved with more accurate ionospheric models. For the Vela pulsar, the combination of our data and historical data from the published literature have enabled us to model long-term correlated trends in RM and dispersion measure (DM) over the past two decades. We detect a change in DM of $\sim 0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ which corresponds to a change in electron density of $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ on a transverse length scale of $\sim$1-2 au. The apparent magnetic field strength in the time-varying region changes from $240^{+30}_{-20}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ to $-6.2^{+0.7}_{-0.9}\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ over the time span of the data set. As well as providing an important validation of polarimetry, this work highlights the pulsar monitoring capabilities of SKA-Low stations, and the niche science opportunities they offer for high-precision polarimetry and probing the microstructure of the magneto-ionic interstellar medium.
#### The Flattest Infrared Extinction Curve in Four Isolated Dense Molecular Cloud Cores

 - **Abstract**
 The extinction curve of interstellar dust in the dense molecular cloud cores is crucial for understanding dust properties, particularly size distribution and composition. We investigate the infrared extinction law in four nearby isolated molecular cloud cores, L429, L483, L673, and L1165, across the 1.2 - 8.0 $\mu$m wavelength range, using deep near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data from UKIDSS and Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations probe an unprecedented extinction depth, reaching $A_V\sim$ 40-60 mag in these dense cloud cores. We derive color-excess ratios $E(K-\lambda)/E(H-K)$ by fitting color-color diagrams of $(K-\lambda)$ versus $(H-K)$, which are subsequently used to calculate the extinction law $A_\lambda/A_K$. Our analysis reveals remarkably similar and exceptionally flat infrared extinction curves for all four cloud cores, exhibiting the most pronounced flattening reported in the literature to date. This flatness is consistent with the presence of large dust grains, suggesting significant grain growth in dense environments. Intriguingly, our findings align closely with the Astrodust model for a diffuse interstellar environment proposed by Hensley \& Draine. This agreement between dense core observations and a diffuse medium model highlights the complexity of dust evolution and the need for further investigation into the processes governing dust properties in different interstellar environments.
