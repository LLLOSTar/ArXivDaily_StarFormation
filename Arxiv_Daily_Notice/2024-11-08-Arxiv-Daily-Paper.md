#### MARFA: An Effective Line-by-line Tool for Calculating Absorption Coefficients and Cross-sections in Planetary Atmospheres
 - **Authors:** Mikhail Razumovskiy, Boris Fomin, Denis Astanin
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03418

 - **Abstract**
 We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- a streamlined efficient tool for line-by-line calculation of atmospheric absorption signatures in the form of PT lookup tables, which may be used in radiative transfer codes. The tool is intended for computations in the IR and visible spectral regions. Core line-by-line scheme features nine-grid interpolation technique, which strikes good balance between speed and accuracy for calculations in the scenario of unknown continuum function and large lines cut-offs. The model features high flexibility, allowing fast recalculations with different line shapes, $\chi$-factors, line cut-offs conditions, and other parameters, making it valuable for planetary studies where atmospheric and spectroscopic data are sparse or uncertain. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web interface for onboarding and immediate usage, and as open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to better connect core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) theory with its observational signatures, we have developed a simulation pipeline from the onset of core collapse to beyond shock breakout. Using this framework, we present a three-dimensional simulation study following the evolution from five seconds to over five days of a 17-M$_{\odot}$ progenitor that explodes with $\sim$10$^{51}$ erg of energy and $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni ejecta. The early explosion is highly asymmetric, expanding most prominently along the southern hemisphere. This early asymmetry is preserved to shock breakout, $\sim$1 day later. Breakout itself evinces strong angle-dependence, with as much a day delay in shock breakout by direction. The nickel ejecta closely tails the forward shock, with velocities at breakout as high as $\sim$7000 km s$^{-1}$. A delayed reverse shock forming at the H/He interface on hour timescales leads to the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, fast-moving nickel bullets, and almost complete mixing of the metal core into the hydrogen envelope. For the first time, we illustrate the angle-dependent emergent broadband and bolometric light curves from simulations evolved in three-dimensions in entirety, continuing through hydrodynamic shock breakout a CCSN model of a massive stellar progenitor evolved with detailed, late-time neutrino microphysics and transport. Our case study of a single progenitor suggests that 3D simulations initiated with detailed neutrino heating can begin to generically produce the cornucopia of suggested asymmetries and features in CCSNe observations, while establishing the methodology to study this problem in breadth.
#### Primordial black holes as supermassive black holes seeds

 - **Abstract**
 The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_{\bullet}\sim 10^{6-10}~M_{\odot}$) in the first cosmic Gyr ($z\gtrsim 6$) challenges current models of BH formation and evolution. We propose a novel mechanism for the formation of early SMBH seeds based on primordial black holes (PBHs). We assume a non-Gaussian primordial power spectrum as expected in inflationary models; these scenarios predict that PBHs are initially clustered and preferentially formed in the high-$\sigma$ fluctuations of the large-scale density field, out of which dark matter (DM) halos are originated. Our model accounts for (i) PBH accretion and feedback, (ii) DM halo growth, and (iii) gas dynamical friction. PBHs lose angular momentum due to gas dynamical friction, sink into a dense core, where BH binaries form and undergo a runaway merger, eventually leading to the formation of a single, massive seed. This mechanism starts at $z\sim 20-40$ in rare halos ($M_h\sim 10^7\ M_\odot$ corresponding to $\sim 5-7\sigma$ fluctuations), and provides massive ($\sim 10^{4-5}~ M_{\odot}$) seeds by $z\sim 10-30$. We derive a physically-motivated seeding prescription that provides the mass of the seed, $ M_{\rm seed}(z)=3.1\times 10^{5}\ { M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-1.2}$, and seeded halo, $ M_{h}(z)=2\times 10^{9}\ {M_{\odot}}[(1+z)/10]^{-2}e^{-0.05z}$ as a function of redshift. This seeding mechanism requires that only a small fraction of DM is constituted by PBHs, namely $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 3 \times 10^{-6}$. We find that $z\sim 6-7$ quasars can be explained with $6\times 10^4 M_{\rm \odot}$ seeds planted at $z\sim 32$, and growing at sub-Eddington rates, $\langle\lambda_{\rm E}\rangle\sim 0.55$. The same scenario reproduces the BH mass of GNz11 at $z=10.6$, while UHZ1 ($z=10.1$) and GHZ9 ($z=10$) data favour instead slightly later ($z\sim 20-25$), more massive ($10^5~M_{\rm \odot}$) seeds.

#### Host-star and exoplanet composition: Polluted white dwarf reveals depletion of moderately refractory elements in planetary material

 - **Abstract**
 Planets form from the same cloud of molecular gas and dust as their host stars. Confirming if planetary bodies acquire the same refractory element composition as their natal disc during formation, and how efficiently volatile elements are incorporated into growing planets, is key to linking the poorly constrained interior composition of rocky exoplanets to the observationally-constrained composition of their host star. Such comparisons also afford insight into the planet formation process. This work compares planetary composition with host-star composition using observations of a white dwarf that has accreted planetary material and its F-type star wide binary companion as a reference for the composition of the natal molecular gas and dust. Spectroscopic analysis reveals abundances of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti in both stars. We use the white dwarf measurements to estimate the composition of the exoplanetary material and the F-type companion to constrain the composition of the material the planet formed from. Comparing planetary material to the composition of its natal cloud, our results reveal that the planetary material is depleted in moderate refractories (Mg, Si, Fe) relative to the refractory material (Ca, Ti). Grouping elements based on their condensation temperatures is key to linking stellar and planetary compositions. Fractionation during formation or subsequent planetary evolution leads to the depletion of moderate refractories from the planetary material accreted by the white dwarf. This signature, as seen for bulk Earth, will likely be present in the composition of many exoplanets relative to their host-stars.
#### Uncovering the structure and kinematics of the ionized core of M\,2-9 with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present interferometric observations at 1 and 3\,mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of the free-free continuum and mm-wavelength recombination line (mRRL) emission of the ionized core (within $\lsim$130\,au) of the young Planetary Nebula (PN) candidate M\,this http URL inner regions are concealed in the vast majority of similar objects. A spectral index for the mm-to-cm continuum of $\sim$0.9 indicates predominantly free-free emission from an ionized wind, with a minor contribution from warm dust. The mm-continuum emission in M\,2-9 reveals an elongated structure along the main symmetry axis of the large-scale bipolar nebula with a C-shaped curvature surrounded by a broad-waisted component. This structure is consistent with an ionized bent jet and a perpendicular compact dusty disk. The presence of a compact equatorial disk (of radius $\sim$50\,au) is also supported by red-shifted CO and \trecem\ absorption profiles observed from the base of the receding north lobe against the compact background continuum. The redshift observed in the CO absorption profiles likely signifies gas infall movements from the disk toward a central source. The mRRLs exhibit velocity gradients along the axis, implying systematic expansion in the C-shaped bipolar outflow. The highest expansion velocities ($\sim$80\,\kms) are found in two diagonally opposed compact regions along the axis, referred to as the high-velocity spots/shells (HVS), indicating either rapid wind acceleration or shocks at radial distances of $\sim$0\farc02-0\farc04 ($\sim$15-25\,au) from the center. A subtle velocity gradient perpendicular to the lobes is also found, suggestive of rotation. Our ALMA observations detect increased brightness and broadness in the mRRLs... (abridged).
#### ALMA Spectral Survey of An eruptive Young star, V883 Ori (ASSAY): II. Freshly Sublimated Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the Keplerian Disk

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with ALMA in Band 6 (220.7$-$274.9 GHz). We identified about 3,700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of COMs detected through the iterative LTE line fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH$_{3}$CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH$_2$OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH$_2$OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COMs abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.
