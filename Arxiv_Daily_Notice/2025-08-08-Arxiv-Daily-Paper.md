#### CLARA: A Modular Framework for Unsupervised Transit Detection Using TESS Light Curves
 - **Authors:** Mainak Dasgupta

 - **Abstract**
 We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). All computations were performed on a personal, CPU-only desktop with an Intel Core i3-8100 processor and 32 GB RAM, using parallelized scoring and classification routines across four physical cores. CLARA processed over 87,000 TESS SPOC light curves (Sectors 1-5) without GPU acceleration in Part-II.

 - **Abstract**
 Prestellar cores represent early sites of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) star and planet formation and provide insight into initial chemical conditions of complex organic molecules (COMs). Deuterated COMs trace the degree of molecular inheritance and/or reprocessing, as high deuteration in protostellar systems suggests COMs forming during the prestellar stage when deuteration is enhanced. Within the L1689N molecular cloud, the prestellar core IRAS 16293E sits $90^{"}$ eastward of the chemically-rich IRAS 16293-2422 A and B protostellar system. A unique view of star formation inside a common natal cloud, IRAS 16293A, B, and E all show some of the highest levels of deuteration in the ISM, with a number of D/H ratios $10^{5}$ times higher than Solar. We investigate for the first time the deuteration levels of the simplest COM, methanol (CH$_3$OH), in IRAS 16293E. Using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m telescope, we target favorable transitions of CH$_2$DOH, CHD$_2$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, and several higher complexity COMs (including acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$) in the 3 mm band. Follow-up observations with the Yebes 40 m telescope provided additional transitions in the 7 mm (Q-band). We report the first detections of these COMs and deuterated methanol in prestellar core IRAS 16293E and use our observations to calculate excitation temperatures, column densities, and relative abundance ratios. Striking similarities are found between relative molecular ratios and D/H values when comparing IRAS 16293E to the A and B protostars, as well as to a heterogeneous sample of other prestellar cores, protostars, and the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Our results support the idea that there is a limited amount of chemical reprocessing of COMs when prestellar cores collapse and heat-up during the protostellar phase.
#### In-Situ Formation of the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt

Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04776

 - **Abstract**
 Cold Classical Kuiper belt objects (CCKBOs) are considered first-generation planetesimals that formed 42-47 au from the Sun and remained untouched since. Formation is thought to proceed by clumping of dust particles in protoplanetary disk gas by the streaming instability, followed by gravitational collapse. Previous calculations along these lines are inconsistent with the CCKB's supposedly pristine nature, because they assume orders of magnitude more solid mass than is actually present in the CCKB (a few thousandths of an Earth mass) and do not explain how to expel the >99% extra mass. Here we show from 3D numerical simulations of dust and gas that the total mass in CCKBOs, their characteristic sizes of ~100 km, and the preponderance of prograde binaries can all be reproduced at the tail end of the solar nebula's life, when it contained just 2-5% of its original (minimum-mass) gas. As a solar metallicity's worth of mm-sized solids drains out from 42-47 au from nebular headwinds, about 1% of the dust collapses into planetesimals that remain behind in the CCKB region. Binarity is guaranteed from a simple analytic estimate, confirmed numerically, of the spin angular momentum in clumps seeded by the streaming instability. We show that other formation scenarios, including trapping of dust within a gas pressure bump, fail to reproduce the low-mass CCKB. Outstanding problems are identified.
#### Constraining the Milky Way dark matter halo with LMC-induced reflex motion

 - **Abstract**
 Modelling perturbations of the Milky Way (MW) halo induced by the infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers new avenues to constrain the dark matter (DM) distribution in our Galaxy. A key observable is the reflex motion of the MW disc with respect to the halo induced by the LMC's infall, which imprints a velocity dipole on kinematics of halo stars. Here we investigate how the dipole varies with Galactocentric radius, and study the sensitivity of the reflex motion signal to different DM outer-halo profiles. Using a suite of basis function expansion (BFE) simulations with truncated NFW profiles ($\rho \propto r^{-\beta}$ beyond $r=50$ kpc), our $N$-body models show that (i) The reflex motion amplitude varies with Galactocentric radius but is largely insensitive to the outer DM slope, implying that the MW-LMC mass ratio alone does not set the dipole strength. (ii) In contrast, the direction of the disc motion is very sensitive to the density distribution of the outer DM halo. (iii) The contraction of the MW halo induced by the LMC's gravitational pull also depends strongly on the outer DM halo profile. (iv) We find a halo instability whose oscillation frequency increases with $\beta$ producing a potentially observable signature - a sinusoidal pattern of the mean radial velocity of halo stars. Finally, using BFE coefficients we find that steeper truncations produce smaller dipole distortions, while amplifying the quadrupole distortion. These results highlight the limited constraining power of the reflex motion amplitude alone for outer MW profile parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Extended X-ray emission observed in the direction of several molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy exhibits spectral and temporal properties consistent with the `X-ray echo' scenario. It postulates that the observed signal is a light-travel-time delayed reflection of a short ($\delta t<$1.5 yr) and bright ($L_{\rm X}>10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) flare, most probably produced a few hundred years ago by Sgr A*. This scenario also predicts a distinct polarization signature for the reflected X-ray continuum, with the polarization vector being perpendicular to the direction towards the primary source and polarization degree (PD) being determined by the scattering angle. We report the results of two deep observations of the currently brightest (in reflected emission) molecular complex Sgr A taken with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in 2022 and 2023. We confirm the previous polarization measurement for a large region encompassing Sgr A complex with higher significance, but also reveal an inconsistent polarization pattern for the brightest reflection region in its center. X-ray polarization from this region is almost perpendicular to the expected direction in the case of Sgr A* illumination and shows a smaller PD compared to the large region. This could indicate the simultaneous propagation of several illumination fronts throughout the CMZ, with the origin of one of them not being Sgr A*. The primary source could be associated with the Arches stellar cluster or a currently unknown source located in the closer vicinity of the illuminated cloud, potentially lowering the required luminosity of the primary source. Although significantly deeper observations with IXPE would be required to unequivocally distinguish between the scenarios, a combination of high-resolution imaging and micro-calorimetric spectroscopy offers an additional promising path forward.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents optical and near-infrared photometric observations, alongside mid-infrared spectroscopic data from the ISO SWS instrument, to examine potential correlations between Aromatic Infrared Band (AIB) features and the optical properties of carbon-rich evolved stars. Identifying such correlations can provide valuable constraints on the evolutionary pathways of low- to intermediate-mass stars beyond the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Photometric measurements in the U, B, V, R, I, J, H, K, and L bands were obtained for five well-known carbon-rich objects at various post-AGB or planetary nebula (PN) stages: CRL 2688, PN M 2-43, NGC 7027, BD${+}$30${^\circ}$3639, and AFGL 2132. Our analysis reveals that all five objects exhibit prominent AIB features; however, their spectral profiles show notable variation. These differences are attributed to variations in the chemical composition and physical conditions of the surrounding circumstellar material. In particular, the 3.28$\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature is detected in all objects except AFGL 2132, indicating a potentially distinct PAH population or environmental condition in its vicinity. Although these sources share broadly similar evolutionary stages, the observed diversity in AIB characteristics underscores the complexity and heterogeneity of their circumstellar environments.
#### Gas Giant and Brown Dwarf Companions: Mass Ratio and Orbital Distributions From A stars to M dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding demographic properties of planet populations and multiple star systems constrains theories of planet and star formation. Surveys for very low-mass companions to M-A type stars detect brown dwarfs from multiple star formation and planets from circumstellar disks. We fit a composite model describing both very low-mass brown dwarf companions from "multiple-like processes" and gas giants from "planet-like processes" as functions of orbital separation and host star mass. We assemble a database of companion frequency estimates for masses from $< 1$ to $> 75$ Jupiter masses, separations from $< 0.3$ to $> 300$ AU, and host masses from $< 0.3$ to $> 2 M_{\odot}$. Using multinest, we fit these data to various models, performing model selection and deriving probability density functions. We assume companion mass ratio distributions are independent of orbital separation and fit a common log-normal orbital distribution to gas giant populations around M dwarfs, FGK, and A stars. A six-parameter model based on companion mass ratio distributions for planets and brown dwarfs is preferred. The planet CMRD slope is consistent with previous studies ($dN/dq \sim q^{-1.3} \pm 0.03$). Gas giant planets around stars from $< 0.3$ to $> 2.0 M_{\odot}$ follow a log-normal distribution peaking at ln(a) = 1.30 $\pm$ 0.03 (3.8 AU) with dispersion 0.22 $\pm$ 0.04. M dwarf distributions peak at smaller orbital radii than A stars, consistent with iceline considerations. Brown dwarf companion distributions extend stellar binary patterns, with the brown dwarf desert explained by flat-in-q mass functions and limited mass ratios below 0.1.
#### Laboratory Modeling of Supernova Remnants Collisions: Implications for Triggered Star Formation

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, particularly those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Simulating stellar dynamics in a molecular cloud environment is numerically challenging due to the strong coupling between young stars and their surrounding gas, and the large range of length and time scales. Aims. This paper is the first of a suite aimed at investigating the complex early stellar dynamics in star-forming regions. We present a new simulation framework which is the key to generating a larger set of simulations, enabling statistical analysis. Methods. Methods originating from the stellar dynamics community, including regularisation and slowdown methods (SDAR), have been added to the hydrodynamical code Phantom to produce simulations of embedded cluster early dynamics. This is completed by a novel prescription of star formation to initialise stars with a low numerical cost, but in a way that is consistent with the gas distribution. Finally, a prescription for H ii region expansion has been added to model the gas removal. Results. We have run testcase simulations following the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters from the cloud collapse to a few Myr. Our new numerical methods fulfil their function by speeding up the calculation. The N-body dynamics with our novel implementation never appear as a bottleneck. Our first simulations show that massive stars largely impact the star formation process and shape the dynamics of the resulting cluster. Depending on the position of these massive stars and the strength of their feedback, they can prematurely dismantle part of the cloud or trigger a second event of cloud collapse, preferentially forming low-mass stars. This stochastic behaviour confirms the need for statistical studies. Conclusions. Our new Phantom N-Body framework enables efficient simulation of the formation and evolution of star clusters. It enables the statistical analysis needed to build models of the dynamical evolution of embedded star clusters.
#### First detection of circular polarization in 4.7 GHz excited OH masers

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of circular polarization in 4.7 GHz excited OH masers in star-forming regions made using full Stokes measurements with the Green Bank 100m telescope. The Zeeman shift between the two circular components provides a measure of the magnetic field pervading these maser spots. Three different methods are used to determine the shift in velocity between the Right Circular Polarization and Left Circular Polarization components. We find fields with $B \sim 100$ mG using archival molecular parameters that have limited precision and uncertain values. Reservations of using 1.7 and 6.0 GHz OH masers to estimate magnetic fields in star-forming regions are discussed.
