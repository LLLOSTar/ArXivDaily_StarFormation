 - **Abstract**
 The Pair Instability (PI) boundary is crucial for understanding heavy merging Black Holes (BHs) and the second mass gap's role in galactic chemical evolution. So far, no works have critically and systematically examined how rotation and mass loss affect the PI boundary or BH masses below it. Rapid rotation significantly alters stellar structure and mass loss, which is expected to have significant effects on the evolution of stellar models. We have previously derived a critical core mass independent of stellar evolution parameters, finding the BH (Pulsational) PI boundary at $M_{ CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$ for a carbon-oxygen (CO) core. Using MESA, we model massive stars around the PI boundary for varying rotation rates and metallicities. We implement mechanical mass loss in MESA, studying its effects on massive stars in low-metallicity environments. Below $1/100$th $Z_\odot$, mechanical mass loss dominates over radiative winds. We check the BH-PI boundary for rapid rotators to confirm our critical core mass criterion and derive model fits describing rotation's impact on core and final masses. Fast rotators reach a point (typically $\Omega / \Omega_{crit} \approx 0.6$) where the entire star becomes chemically homogeneous, evolving like a stripped star. This lowers the maximum BH mass before PI to its critical core mass of $M_{CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$, aligning with the bump feature in the BH mass distribution observed by LIGO/VIRGO.

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), including their subclasses of low-luminosity GRBs (LL-GRBs) and X-ray flashes (XRFs) characterized by low spectral peak energies, are known to be associated with broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL), which result from the core collapse of massive stars that lose their outer hydrogen and helium envelopes. However, the soft and weak end of the GRB/XRF population remains largely unexplored, due to the limited sensitivity to soft X-ray emission. Here we report the discovery of a fast X-ray transient, EP250108a, detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) in the soft X-ray band at redshift $z = 0.176$, which was followed up by extensive multiband observations. EP250108a shares similar X-ray luminosity as XRF\,060218, the prototype of XRFs, but it extends GRBs/XRFs down to the unprecedentedly soft and weak regimes, with its $E_{\rm peak} \lesssim 1.8\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $E_{\rm iso} \lesssim 10^{49}\, \mathrm{erg}$, respectively. Meanwhile, EP250108a is found to be associated with SN\,2025kg, one of the most luminous and possibly magnetar-powered SNe Ic-BL detected so far. Modeling of the well-sampled optical light curves favors a mildly relativistic outflow as the origin of this event. This discovery demonstrates that EP, with its unique capability, is opening a new observational window into the diverse outcomes of death of massive stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of Saturn is modeled by detailed numerical simulations according to the core-nucleated accretion scenario. Previous models are enhanced to include the dissolution of accreting planetesimals, composed of water ice, rock, and iron, in the gaseous envelope of the planet, leading to a non-uniform composition with depth. The immiscibility of helium in metallic hydrogen layers is also considered. The calculations start at a mass $0.5$ Earth masses and are extended to the present day. At 4.57 Gyr, the model, proceeding outwards, has the following structure: (i) a central core composed of $100$% heavy elements and molecules, (ii) a region with decreasing heavy element mass fraction, down to a value of $0.1$, (iii) a layer of uniform composition with the helium mass fraction $Y$ enhanced over the primordial value, (iv) a helium rain region with a gradient in $Y$, (v) an outer convective, adiabatic region with uniform composition in which $Y$ is reduced from the primordial value, and (vi) the very outer layers where cloud condensation of the heavy elements occurs. Models of the distribution of heavy elements as a function of radius are compared with those derived to fit the observations of the Cassini mission, with rough qualitative agreement. The helium mass fraction in Saturn's outer layers is estimated to be around $20$%. Models are found which provide good agreement with Saturn's intrinsic luminosity and radius.
#### Formation of the glycine isomer glycolamide (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) on the surfaces of interstellar ice grains: Insights from atomistic simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Syn-glycolamide, a glycine isomer, has recently been detected in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud. Investigations on its formation in the interstellar medium could offer insights into synthetic routes leading to glycine in prebiotic environments. Quantum chemical simulations on glycolamide (NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$OH) formation on interstellar ice mantles, mimicked by a water ice cluster model, are presented. Glycolamide synthesis has been here modeled considering a stepwise process: the coupling between formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and the radical of formamide (NH$_2$CO$^{\bullet}$) occurs first, forming the glycolamide precursor NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$, which is then hydrogenated to give anti-glycolamide. We hypothesize that anti-to-syn interconversion will occur in conjunction with glycolamide desorption from the ice surface. The reaction barrier for NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$ formation varies from 9 to 26 kJ mol$^{-1}$, depending on surface binding sites. Kinetic studies indicate that this reaction step is feasible in environments with a $T > 35~\text{K}$, until desorption of the reactants. The hydrogenation step leading to anti-glycolamide presents almost no energy barrier due to the easy H atom diffusion towards the NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$ intermediate. However, it competes with the extraction of an H atom from the formyl group of NH$_2$C(O)CH$_2$O$^{\bullet}$, which leads to formyl formamide, NH$_2$C(O)CHO, and H$_2$. Nonetheless, according to our results, anti-glycolamide formation is predicted to be the most favored reactive channel.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes, both supermassive and stellar-mass, impact the evolution of their surroundings on a large range of scales. While the role of supermassive black holes is well studied, the effects of stellar-mass black holes on their surroundings, particularly in inducing structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), remain under explored. This study focuses on the black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, renowned for its active jets, and the primary aim is to unveil and characterise the impact of GRS 1915+105 on its environment by identifying structures induced by jet-ISM interaction. Methods: We observed GRS 1915+105 with MeerKAT for a total exposure time of 14~hr, and we obtained the deepest image of GRS 1915+105 to date. Using a previously proposed self-similar model for large-scale jets, we inferred the properties of both the jets and the ISM, providing insights into the jet-ISM interaction site. Our observations revealed a bow shock structure near GRS 1915+105, likely induced by a jet interacting with the ISM and blowing an overpressured cavity in the medium. We constrained the ISM density to 100--160 particles\,cm$^{-3}$ while assuming a temperature range of 10$^4$--10$^6$\,K, which implies a bow shock expansion velocity of $20\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}<\dot{L} <\,360\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. We estimate that the jet responsible for the formation of the bow shock has an age between 0.09 and 0.22 Myr, and the time-averaged energy rate Conclusions: Our results confirm that in stellar-mass black holes, the energy dissipated through jets can be comparable to the accretion energy, and through the interaction of the jet with the ISM, such energy is transferred back to the environment. This feedback mechanism mirrors the powerful influence of supermassive black holes on their environments, underscoring the significant role a black hole's activity has in shaping its surroundings.

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby (d=3.6 Mpc) starburst galaxy M82 has been studied for several decades by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) networks such as e-MERLIN and the European VLBI Network (EVN). The numerous supernova remnants (SNRs), HII regions and other exotic transients make it a perfect laboratory for studying stellar evolution and the interstellar medium (ISM). Its proximity provides a linear resolution of 17 pc/arcsec, enabling decadal-time-scale variability and morphology studies of the tens of compact radio sources. In this proceedings, we describe new techniques developed in the last ten years that provide deeper, more robust imaging, enable in-band spectral index mapping, and allow wider fields of view to be imaged to find new radio sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of EP250108a/SN 2025kg, a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) accompanying an Einstein Probe (EP) fast X-ray transient (FXT) at $z=0.176$. EP250108a/SN 2025kg possesses a double-peaked optical light curve and its spectrum transitions from a blue underlying continuum to a typical SN Ic-BL spectrum over time. We fit a radioactive decay model to the second peak of the optical light curve and find SN parameters that are consistent with the SNe Ic-BL population, while its X-ray and radio properties are consistent with those of low-luminosity GRB (LLGRB) 060218/SN 2006aj. We explore three scenarios to understand the system's multi-wavelength emission -- (a) SN ejecta interacting with an extended circumstellar medium (CSM), (b) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in its stellar envelope, and (c) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in an extended CSM. All three models can explain the optical light curve and are also consistent with the radio and X-ray observations. We favor models (a) and (c) because they self-consistently explain both the X-ray prompt emission and first optical peak, but we do not rule out model (b). From the properties of the first peak in models (a) and (c), we find evidence that EP250108a/SN 2025kg interacts with an extended CSM, and infer an envelope mass $M_{\rm e} \sim 0.1\,\rm M_\odot$ and radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 4 \times 10^{13}$ cm. EP250108a/SN 2025kg's multi-wavelength properties make it a close analog to LLGRB 060218/SN 2006aj, and highlight the power of early follow-up observations in mapping the environments of massive stars prior to core collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion and outflows are astrophysical phenomena observed across a wide range of objects, from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. Developing a complete picture of these processes requires complementary studies across this full spectrum of jet-launching sources. Jet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction sites near black hole X-ray binaries provide unique laboratories to study jet energetics. This work aims to detect and characterise the bow shock near one black hole X-ray binary, Cyg X-1, and then use this bow shock structure to parametrise the properties of the jet launched by Cyg X-1 over its lifetime. We used the MeerKAT radio telescope to investigate the bow shock structure formed by the interaction between the jets of Cyg X-1 and the ISM. We successfully detect the bow shock north of Cyg X-1 in the L and S bands and report its size and brightness. We present the spectral index distribution across the bow shock, which is in the range -0.9 to 0.4, with an error distribution (0.6 to 1.5) that peaks at unity. We determine that the unshocked ISM density is 6-7 cm^-3 for a temperature range of 10^4 to 3*10^6 K. This temperature range suggests that the velocity of the bow shock is 21 km/s to 364 km/s. The age of the Cyg X-1 jet responsible for the bow shock is 0.04 to 0.3 Myr, and the power of the jet is constrained to 2*10^31 ergs/s to 10^35 ergs/s. We also detect new morphological features of the bow shock in the S-band image. The comparison of archival H_alpha maps with the new radio observations hints at different regions of emission, different temperature ranges, and different ISM densities. The spectral index suggests a consistent emission origin across the structure. The ISM density around Cyg X-1 is on the higher end for Galactic environments, and our results indicate a lower jet energy transport rate than prior estimates.
#### Spectral Irradiance Variability in Lyman-Alpha Emission During Solar Flares

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha (Ly{\alpha};1216 Å) line is the brightest emission line in the quiescent solar spectrum and radiates a significant fraction of the available nonthermal energy during flares. Despite its importance, there is a lack of detailed studies of Ly{\alpha} spectral variability during flares. Recently, spectrally resolved Ly{\alpha} flare observations from the SORCE/SOLSTICE instrument have become available. This study examines Ly{\alpha} spectral variability and its relationship with HXR emission from nonthermal electrons, using observations of two M-class flares from SORCE/SOLSTICE and RHESSI. Imaging observations from STEREO/SECCHI EUVI and SDO/AIA provide further context. Enhancements across the Ly{\alpha} line profile were found to closely correlate with bursts of HXR emission, suggesting a primarily nonthermal origin. Red enhancement asymmetries at the peak of each flare were attributed to chromospheric evaporation, while blue wing enhancement and blue asymmetry were linked to a bright filament-eruption seen in SDO/AIA 1600 Å images. These findings contribute to the understanding of spectral Ly{\alpha} variability during flares and highlight the need for future studies using a higher quality and quantity of spectral Ly{\alpha} flare observations. Such studies will further characterise the physical mechanisms driving Ly{\alpha} flare variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Open clusters offer unique opportunities to study stellar dynamics and evolution under the influence of their internal gravity, the Milky Way's gravitational field, and the interactions with encounters. Using the Gaia DR3 data for a catalog of open clusters within 500 parsecs that exhibit tidal features reported by the literature, we apply a novel method based on 3D principal component analysis to select a ``golden sample'' of nearby open clusters with minimal line-of-sight distortions. This approach ensures a systematic comparison of 3D and 2D structural parameters for tidally perturbed clusters. The selected golden sample includes Blanco 1, Melotte 20, Melotte 22, NGC 2632, NGC 7092, NGC 1662, Roslund 6 and Melotte 111. We analyze these clusters by fitting both 2D and 3D King Profiles to their stellar density distributions. Our results reveal systematic discrepancies: most of the golden sample clusters exhibit larger 3D tidal radii compared to their 2D counterparts, demonstrating that the 2D projection effects bias the measured cluster size. Furthermore, the 3D density profiles show stronger deviations from King profiles at the tidal radii ($\Delta \rho_{\rm 3D} > \Delta \rho_{\rm 2D}$), highlighting enhanced sensitivity to tidal disturbances. Additionally, we investigate the spatial distribution of cluster members relative to their bulk motion in the Galactic plane. We find that some clusters exhibit tidal features oriented perpendicular to their direction of motion, which can be attributed to the fact that the current surveys only detect the curved inner regions of the tidal features. In conclusion, this work offers a golden sample of nearby open clusters that are most reliable for 3D structure analysis and underscores the necessity of 3D analysis in characterizing OC morphological asymmetries, determining cluster size, and identifying tidal features.
