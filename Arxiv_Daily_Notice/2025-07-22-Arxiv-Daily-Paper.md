#### Modeling the Reverberation Response of the Broad Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei II: Incorporating Photoionization Models

 - **Abstract**
 The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by Active Galactic Nuclei respond to variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line Region (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In this work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated the reverberation responses of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, MgII$\lambda$2800 and CIV$\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted radii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity field. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud emission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium. These competing attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the HL Tau dust disk by modeling its intensity profiles across six wavelengths (0.45 to 7.9 mm) with a resolution of 0.05 arcsec ($\sim7$ au). Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain key dust properties including temperature, surface density, maximum grain size, composition, filling factor, and size distribution. The full fitting, with all parameters free, shows a preference for organics-rich dust with a low filling factor in the outer region ($r \gtrsim 40$ au), where the spectral index is $\sim3.7$, but amorphous-carbon-rich dust also reasonably reproduces the observed intensity profiles. Considering the scattering polarization observed at 0.87 mm, compact, amorphous-carbon-rich dust is unlikely, and moderately porous dust is favored. Beyond 40 au, the maximum dust size is likely $\sim100~{\rm \mu m}$ if dust is compact or amorphous-carbon rich. However, if the dust is moderately porous and organics-rich, both the predicted dust surface density and dust size can be sufficiently large for the pebble accretion rate to reach $\sim10M_{\oplus}~{\rm Myr^{-1}}$ in most regions, suggesting that pebble accretion could be a key mechanism for forming planets in the disk. In contrast, if the dust is amorphous-carbon-rich, forming a giant planet core via pebble accretion is unlikely due to the combined effects of low dust surface density and small dust size required to match the observed emission, suggesting other mechanisms, such as disk fragmentation due to gravitational instability, may be responsible for planet formation in the HL Tau disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.

 - **Abstract**
 ALMA-IMF is a large program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) that aims to determine the origin of the core mass function (CMF) of 15 massive Galactic protoclusters (~ 1.0-25.0 x 10^3 solar mass within ~ 2.5 x 2.5 pc^2 ) located towards the Galactic plane. In addition, the objective of the program is to obtain a thorough understanding of their physical and kinematic properties. Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with C18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the size-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s show a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary stage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such values of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the C18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature. In addition, we compare the non-thermal velocity dispersions (sigma_nth, C18O) obtained from the C18O(2-1) line with the non-thermal line widths (sigma_nth, DCN ) of the cores obtained from the DCN (3-2) line. We observe that, on average, the non-thermal linewidth in cores is half that of the gas surrounding them. This suggests that turbulence diminishes at smaller scales or dissipates at the periphery of the cores. Furthermore, we examine the size-linewidth relation for the structures we extracted from the position-position-velocity C18O(2-1) line emission cube with dendrogram algorithm. The power-law index (p) obtained from the size-linewidth relation is between 0.41 and 0.64, steeper than the Kolmogorov law of turbulence, as expected for compressible media. In conclusion, this work is one of the first to carry out such a statistical study of turbulence for embedded massive protoclusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000 au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\odot}$. Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.
#### Electron impact ro-vibrational transitions and dissociative recombination of H2+ and HD+: Rate coefficients and astrophysical implications

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Molecular hydrogen and its cation H+2 are among the first species formed in the early Universe, and play a key role in the thermal and chemical evolution of the primordial gas. In molecular clouds, H+2 ions formed through ionization of H2 by particles react rapidly with H2 to form H+3 , triggering the formation of almost all detected interstellar molecules. Aims. We present a new set of cross sections and rate coefficients for state-to-state ro-vibrational transitions of the H+2 and HD+ ions, induced by low-energy electron collisions. Study includes the major electron-impact processes relevant for low-metallicity astrochemistry: inelastic and superelastic scattering, and dissociative recombination. Methods. The electron-induced processes involving H+2 and HD+ are treated using the multichannel quantum defect theory. Results. The newly calculated thermal rate coefficients show significant differences compared to those used in previous studies. When introduced into astrochemical models, particularly for shock-induced chemistry in metal-free gas, the updated dissociative recombination rates produce substantial changes in the predicted molecular abundances. Conclusions. These data provide updated and improved input for the modeling of hydrogen-rich plasmas in environments

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of 32 type II supernovae (SNe II) with plateau phase photometry and late phase ($nebular$) spectroscopy available, aiming to bridge the gap between the surface and core of their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors. Using \texttt{MESA}\,+\texttt{STELLA}, we compute an extensive grid of SN II light curve models originating from RSG with effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$ around 3650\,K and hydrogen-rich envelopes artificially stripped to varying degrees. These models are then used to derive the hydrogen-rich envelope masses $M_{\rm Henv}$ for SNe II from their plateau phase light curves. Nebular spectroscopy further constrains the progenitor RSG's luminosity log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and is employed to remove the degeneracies in light curve modeling. The comparison between log\,$L_{\rm prog}$-$M_{\rm Henv}$ reveals that $M_{\rm Henv}$ spans a broad range at the same log\,$L_{\rm prog}$, and almost all SNe II have lower $M_{\rm Henv}$ than the prediction of the default stellar wind models. We explore alternative wind prescriptions, binary evolution models, and the possibility of more compact RSG progenitors. Although binary interaction offers a compelling explanation for the non-monotonicity and large scatter in the log\,$L_{\rm prog}$-$M_{\rm Henv}$ relation, the high occurrence rate of partially-stripped RSGs cannot be accounted for by stable binary mass transfer alone without fine-tuned orbital parameters. This highlights that, despite being the most commonly observed class of core-collapse SNe, SNe II likely originate from a variety of mass-loss histories and evolutionary pathways that are more diverse and complex than typically assumed in standard stellar evolution models.

 - **Abstract**
 Moreton waves are widely regarded as the chromospheric counterpart of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves propagating in the corona. However, direct observational evidence confirming their simultaneous propagation across multiple atmospheric layers from the corona through the transition region to the chromosphere has been lacking. In this study, we present comprehensive observational evidence of a three-dimensional (3D) fast-mode wave propagating from the corona through the transition region into the chromosphere, exhibiting a gradual deceleration. Additionally, this wave interacts with three filaments (F1, F2, and F3) along its path, inducing oscillation with multiple amplitudes: Filaments F1 and F2 exhibit simultaneous horizontal and vertical large-scale oscillations ($\sim$\speed{20}), while Filament F3 only exhibits vertical small-scale oscillation ($\sim$\speed{4}). Interestingly, F1 displays a similar oscillation period of about 500\,s in both horizontal and vertical directions, whereas F2 shows significantly different periods in these two dimensions (1100\,s and 750\,s), and F3 exhibits only a vertical oscillation with a period of about 450\,s. Based on this kinematic behavior, we propose that their oscillations were likely triggered by compression from the flanks of the dome-shaped wavefront. We further estimate the magnetic fields of the filaments. The radial (axial) magnetic fields for F1 and F2 are estimated to be 14.9\,G (28.6\,G) and 9.9\,G (18.6\,G), respectively. For F3, we estimate its radial magnetic field to be 16.6\,G.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethylene glycol ($\mathrm{(CH_2OH)_2}$, hereafter EG) and Glycolonitrile ($\mathrm{HOCH_2CN}$, hereafter GN) are considered molecular precursors of nucleic acids. EG is a sugar alcohol and the reduced form of Glycolaldehyde ($\mathrm{CH_2(OH)CHO}$, hereafter GA). GN is considered a key precursor of adenine formation (nucleotide) and can be a precursor of glycine (amino acid). Detections of such prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium are increasingly common. How much of this complexity endures to the planet formation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely unknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary disk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori. The observed EG emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.63^{+0.11}_{-0.12} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of at least 300 K. The observed GN emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.37^{+0.09}_{-0.09} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $88^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ K. Comparing the abundance of EG and GN relative to methanol in V883 Ori with other objects, V883 Ori falls between hot cores and comets in terms of increasing complexity. This suggests that the build up of prebiotic molecules continues past the hot core phase into the epoch of planet formation. Nascent planets in such environments may inherit essential building blocks for life, enhancing their potential habitability. Further observations of this protoplanetary disk at higher spectral resolution are required to resolve blended lines and to confirm these tentative detection.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model $\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of analysis analysis to increase.

 - **Abstract**
 While astrophysical observations imply that 85% of the matter content is unaccounted for, the nature of this dark matter (DM) component remains unknown. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) - DM particles that interact at or below the weak interaction scale - could naturally explain this missing matter. These interactions with the Standard Model (SM) allow them to be gravitationally captured in celestial bodies like the Sun. Trapped DM in the solar core could subsequently annihilate, producing stable SM particles, of which only neutrinos can escape the Sun's dense interior. Therefore, an excess of neutrinos originating from the direction of the Sun would serve as evidence of DM. The IceCube Upgrade, a dense infill of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, will lower the energy threshold and improve sensitivity in the range from 1 to 500 GeV, thereby enhancing IceCube's ability to detect GeV-scale DM. In this contribution, I present projections of the IceCube Upgrade's sensitivity to the DM-proton scattering cross section for DM masses between 3 GeV and 500 GeV. These sensitivities position IceCube as the most sensitive indirect detection experiment for DM in the mass range from 3 GeV to 10 TeV.
#### Precise Asteroseismology of the High-amplitude Delta Scuti Star EH Librae, an AE UMa Analogue in the Hertzsprung Gap

 - **Abstract**
 A subclass of intermediate mass variables Delta Scuti stars, known as High-amplitude Delta Scuti (HADS) stars, exhibits pronounced radial pulsations with high amplitudes. The ground-based and space-based observations of the HADS star EH Lib are used to help making asteroseismological analysis of this pulsating star. Following the reduction of the light curves, the frequency analysis reveals the fundamental frequency as $f_0=11.3105$ c day$^{-1}$ and two more significant frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$, in addition to the harmonics of $f_0$ and a linear combination. The period change rate is determined as $(1/P_0)(dP_0/dt)=(5.4\pm0.5)\times10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$ derived from an O-C diagram, which is constructed from 342 times of maximum light spanning over 70 years. Using these observational constraints, along with the metallicity reported in the literature, we construct theoretical models using the stellar evolution code MESA and calculate the theoretical frequencies of the eigen modes using the oscillation code GYRE. The appropriate models are selected by matching both $f_0$ and $(1/P_0)(dP_0/dt)$ within their respective uncertainties. The results indicate that the observed period change of EH Lib can be attributed to stellar evolutionary effects. The stellar parameters of EH Lib are derived as: the mass of $1.715\pm0.065$ M$_{\odot}$, the luminosity of log $(L/L_{\odot})=1.38\pm0.06$, and the age of $(1.14\pm0.13)\times10^{9}$ years. EH Lib is classified as a single-mode HADS star, locating currently in the Hertzsprung gap, with a helium core and a hydrogen-burning shell. This work expands the asteroseismological sample of HADS stars and establishes a foundation for future investigations into their commonalities and specific properties, thereby advancing our understanding of these variables.

 With the same general purposes as Part I of this monograph, we analyze here major events in the history of the Earth, such as the formation of the Earth itself, the origin of life, the great glaciations and the mass extinctions of species, and we also analyze the astronomical context in which they occurred. We argue that the Sun was captured around 500-700 Myr ago by a supercloud, of which the Orion arm and Gould's belt are currently part, and that this event marked the history of the Earth. With this fact, we associate a massive capture of comets by the Sun, the great glaciations of the Cryogenic period, the emergence of complex life in the Cambrian and the recurrent mass extinctions of species.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts are expected to be generated by structured jets, whose profiles significantly impact their afterglow emission. Previously, we developed a numerical code jetsimpy, to model the afterglow of jets with arbitrary angular profiles. In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a stratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary axisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the formation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy conservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach. This leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In particular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is significantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis reverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick shell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the prediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we find that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or thick shell cases. A radial profile also introduces hydrodynamic energy injection. As such, our code can naturally apply to refreshed shock cases, where the modeling of kilonova afterglows is demonstrated as an example. To validate our method, we fit the optical flash of GRB 990123, showing good agreement with the data. The upgraded jetsimpy provides unprecedented flexibility in modeling the afterglow emission of jets with various profiles, including those derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations.
#### The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Revisiting the GJ 317, GJ 463, and GJ 3512 systems and two newly discovered planets orbiting GJ 9773 and GJ 508.2

 - **Abstract**
 Surveys for exoplanets indicate that the occurrence rate of gas giant planets orbiting late-type stars in orbits with periods shorter than 1000 days is lower than in the case of Sun-like stars. This is in agreement with planet formation models based on the core or pebble accretion paradigm. The CARMENES exoplanet survey has been conducting radial-velocity observations of several targets that show long-period trends or modulations that are consistent with the presence of giant planets at large orbital separations. We present an analysis of five such systems that were monitored with the CARMENES spectrograph, as well as with the IRD spectrograph. In addition, we used archival data to improve the orbital parameters of the planetary systems. We improve the parameters of three previously known planets orbiting the M dwarfs GJ 317, GJ 463, and GJ 3512. We also determine the orbital parameters and minimum mass of the planet GJ 3512 c, for which only lower limits had been given previously. Furthermore, we present the discovery of two new giant planets orbiting the stars GJ 9733 and GJ 508.2, although for the second one only lower limits to the orbital properties can be determined. The new planet discoveries add to the short list of known giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars with subsolar metallicity at long orbital periods above 2000 days. These results reveal that giant planets appear to form more frequently in wide orbits than in close-in orbits around low-mass and lower metallicity stars.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 and under the guidance of the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU), efforts are underway to establish AlUla Manara as the Kingdom first major astronomical observatory. This study presents a preliminary assessment of the site based on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data to evaluate its suitability for hosting a 4m-class optical-IR telescope. AlUla Manara is located on a remote plateau 74 km north of the historical town of AlUla and was recently designated as an International Dark Sky Park. The analysis focuses on key astro-meteorological parameters such as seeing, temperature regimes, wind patterns, cloud cover and precipitable water vapor (PWV). Results show a median nighttime seeing of 1.5 arcsec, a median cold season PWV of 3.2 mm, and over 79% of nighttime hours with clear sky conditions. Wind regimes are generally mild, posing no constraints on infrastructure. The analysis includes three further sites in the Kingdom, namely Volcanic Top, Ward Mountain, and Dubba Mountain. These sites exhibit better turbulence conditions, but are located outside RCU jurisdiction. Nevertheless, AlUla Manara remains a competitive candidate thanks to its alignment with broader regional development goals. To validate these preliminary results, a dedicated Astronomical Site Monitor has been deployed on site to support the design and operational planning of the observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 Downward Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) are sub-millisecond bursts of MeV gamma rays produced in thunderclouds. According to the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche model, gamma rays are produced, via bremsstrahlung, from electron cascades activated by a relativistic "seed" electron. It is not clear what mechanism is responsible for the acceleration of electrons to relativistic energies in electric discharges. To better understand the acceleration sites and the TGF production mechanisms, it is critically important to identify the TGF source position and geometry in the atmosphere and to study the gamma emission characteristics. The Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, with its 1600 water-Cherenkov detectors very sensitive to high-energy photons and with a very fine time-sampling, is a valuable instrument to study downward TGFs. The possibility to analyze the radiation emission in detail led to the observation of the first TGFs with an asymmetric azimuthal structure, suggesting a complex source different from the initially hypothesized downward beam. We report on these observations and the new perspectives which may open with the incorporation of new instruments at the Auger site to study lightning development alongside gamma emission, and the increasingly detailed data provided by satellites and global lightning networks.

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of the Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) sources are known to be accreting neutron stars as they show coherent X-ray pulsations with pulse periods ranging from ~1-30 seconds. While initially thought to host intermediate-mass black holes, ULXs have since been recognized as a diverse class of objects, including ULX pulsars. These pulsars require models specifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct from those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all Galactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds) are dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a soft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of five ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show that their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models, similar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. A soft excess is detected in all the sources which is also consistent with the local X-ray pulsars that have low absorption column density. We have marginal detection or low upper limit on the presence of the iron K-alpha emission line from these sources, which is a key difference of the ULX pulsars with the local accreting X-ray pulsars. We discuss the implication of this on the nature of the binary companion and the accretion mechanism in the ULX pulsars.
#### SDSO1 is a Ghost Planetary Nebula Bow Shock in Front of M31

 - **Abstract**
 We present new, deep narrow band imagery and discuss the nature of SDSO1, the large [O III]-emitting nebula centered 1.5 degrees SE of M31. We find strong evidence to support the hypothesis that SDSO1 is unrelated to M31 and is instead a bow shock driven by a faded, giant (D = 20 pc), 400 kyr-old, ghost planetary nebula (GPN) expelled by the symbiotic WD binary star EG Andromedae. Because EG And lags the rotation of the Milky Way, its hypersonic velocity of 107 km/s drives a shock into the local interstellar medium. SDSO1 also sports a 45-pc long turbulent tail that crosses M31. We establish the shock-powered GPN phase as a new phase of PN evolution, and identify seven more candidate GPNe by their large size and shock-tail morphology. This includes several giant halos of younger planetary nebulae, possibly expelled by now degenerate binary companions. The interaction of an old, fast-moving GPN with the ISM generates a shock that remains visible long after the photoionized PN shell has faded below the limit of detectability. The SDSO1 GPN has reached a phase in its evolution where its outward expansion has been slowed considerably by the work it has done on the interstellar medium. Once the GPN outflow expends the rest of its kinetic energy, it will be stripped from EG And and mix into the surrounding ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols is an old topic in the young field of exoplanet atmospheres. Understanding what they are, how they form, and where they go has long provided a fertile playground for theorists. For observers, however, aerosols have been a multi-decade migraine, as their chronic presence hides atmospheric features. For hot Jupiters, the large day-night temperature contrast drives inhomogeneous thermal structures and aerosol distribution, leading to different limb properties probed by transit spectra. We present JWST NIRISS/SOSS spectra of morning and evening limbs for nine gas giants with equilibrium temperatures of ~800-1700 K. By measuring feature size of the 1.4 $\mu$m water band for both limbs, we found three planets (WASP-39 b, WASP-94 Ab, and WASP-17 b) show prominent ($>$5$\sigma$) limb-limb atmospheric opacity difference with muted morning and clear evening limbs. The heavily muted water features on morning limbs indicate high-altitude (0.1 to 0.01 mbar) aerosols. To simultaneously have clear evening limbs requires processes with timescales ($\sim$day) comparable to advection to remove these lofted grains, and we found that both downwelling flow and dayside cloud evaporation could be plausible mechanisms. We hypothesize an empirical boundary--termed the "asymmetry horizon"--in temperature-gravity space that marks the transition where inhomogeneous aerosol coverage begins to emerge. Heterogeneous aerosol coverage is common among hot Jupiters. If unrecognized, limb averaging suppresses spectral features, mimicking high-mean-molecular-weight atmospheres, inflating inferred metallicity by up to 2 dex, and underestimating limb temperatures by as much as half. Finally, we introduce the Limb Spectroscopy Metric (LSM) to predict limb spectral feature size based on planet parameters.
