 - **Abstract**
 We present SOFIA/HAWC+ continuum polarisation data on the magnetic fields threading 17 pc-scale massive molecular clumps at the western end of the $\eta$ Car GMC (Region 9 of CHaMP, representing all stages of star formation from pre-stellar to dispersing via feedback), revealing important details about the field morphology and role in the gas structures of this clump sample. We performed Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi and Histogram of Relative Orientation analyses tracing column densities 25.0 $<$ log($N$/m$^{-2}$) $<$ 27.2. With HRO, magnetic fields change from mostly parallel to column density structures to mostly perpendicular at a threshold $N_{\rm crit}$ = (3.7$\pm$0.6)$\times$10$^{26}$ m$^{-2}$, indicating that gravitational forces exceed magnetic forces above this value. The same analysis in 10 individual clumps gives similar results, with the same clear trend in field alignments and a threshold $N_{\rm crit}$ = (1.9$^{+1.5}_{-0.8}$)$\times$10$^{26}$ m$^{-2}$. In the other 7 clumps, the alignment trend with $N$ is much flatter or even reversed, inconsistent with the usual HRO pattern. Instead, these clumps' fields reflect external environmental forces, such as from the nearby HII region NGC 3324. DCF analysis reveals field strengths somewhat higher than typical of nearby clouds, with the $Bn$ data lying mostly above the Crutcher (2012) relation. The mass:flux ratio $\lambda$ across all clumps has a gaussian distribution, with log$\lambda_{\rm DCF}$ = -0.75$\pm$0.45 (mean$\pm\sigma$): only small areas are dominated by gravity. However, a significant trend of rising log$\lambda$ with falling $T_{\rm dust}$ parallels Pitts et al's (2019) result: $T_{\rm dust}$ falls as $N_{\rm H_2}$ rises towards clump centres. Thus, in this massive clump sample, magnetic fields provide enough support against gravity to explain their overall low star formation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 A longstanding prediction in interstellar theory posits that significant quantities of molecular gas, crucial for star formation, may be undetected due to being ``dark" in commonly used molecular gas tracers, such as carbon monoxide. We report the discovery of Eos, the closest dark molecular cloud, located just 94 parsecs from the Sun. This cloud is the first molecular cloud ever to be identified using H$_2$ far ultra-violet (FUV) fluorescent line emission, which traces molecular gas at the boundary layers of star-forming and supernova remnant regions. The cloud edge is outlined along the high-latitude side of the North Polar Spur, a prominent x-ray/radio structure. Our distance estimate utilizes 3D dust maps, the absorption of the soft X-ray background, and hot gas tracers such as O\,{\sc vi}; these place the cloud at a distance consistent with the Local Bubble's surface. Using high-latitude CO maps we note a small amount (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx$20-40\,M$_\odot$) of CO-bright cold molecular gas, in contrast with the much larger estimate of the cloud's true molecular mass (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx3.4\times 10^3$\,M$_\odot$), indicating most of the cloud is CO-dark. Combining observational data with novel analytical models and simulations, we predict this cloud will photoevaporate in 5.7 million years, placing key constraints on the role of stellar feedback in shaping the closest star-forming regions to the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 Phosphorus is a key element that plays an essential role in biological processes important for living organisms on Earth. The origin and connection of phosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming molecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited observations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M < $ a few M$_\odot$) star formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes detect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions of PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass starless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated with bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the main driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase, but that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself, but quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative transfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be $3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming regions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming region reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of ten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center molecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard Galactic cosmic-ray ionization rates. These results motivate the need for additional observations that can better disentangle the physical mechanisms and chemical drivers of this precursor of prebiotic chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 The Eos cloud, recently discovered in the far ultraviolet via H$_2$ fluorescence, is one of the nearest known dark molecular clouds to the Sun, with a distance spanning from $\sim94-136$pc. However, with a mass ($\sim5.5\times10^3$M$_\odot$) just under $40$ per cent that of star forming clouds like Taurus and evidence for net molecular dissociation, its evolutionary and star forming status is uncertain. We use Gaia data to investigate whether there is evidence for a young stellar population that may have formed from the Eos cloud. Comparing isochrones and pre-main sequence evolutionary models there is no clear young stellar population in the region. While there are a small number of $<10$Myr stars, that population is statistically indistinguishable from those in similar search volumes at other Galactic latitudes. We also find no unusual spatial or kinematic clustering toward the Eos cloud over distances $70-150$pc. Overall we conclude that the Eos cloud has most likely not undergone any recent substantial star formation, and further study of the dynamics of the cloud is required to determine whether it will do so in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently-discovered Eos molecular cloud, is a CO-dark, low-density cloud located at a distance of approximately 94 pc from the Sun which does not appear to have formed stars at any point in its history. In this paper we investigate the magnetic fields in the Eos cloud, near the interface between the atomic Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and molecular gas, using dust emission and extinction polarimetry. A Histogram of Relative Orientation analysis shows that the magnetic field is preferentially parallel to the density structure of the cloud, while a Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi analysis finds magnetic field strengths of 8$\pm$4 $\mu$G across the Eos cloud and 12$\pm$4 $\mu$G in the somewhat denser MBM 40 sub-region. These results are consistent with a previous estimate of magnetic field strength in the Local Bubble and suggest that the fields in the Eos cloud are dynamically important compared to both gravity and turbulence. Our findings are fully consistent with the expected behavior of magnetized, non-self-gravitating gas near the CNM/molecular cloud boundary.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The 1.8 MeV gamma-rays corresponding to the decay of the radioactive isotope Al-26 (with a half-life of 0.72 Myr) have been observed by the SPI detector on the INTEGRAL spacecraft and extensively used as a tracer of star formation and current nucleosynthetic activity in the Milky Way Galaxy. Further information is encoded in the observation related to the higher Al-26 content found in regions of the Galaxy with the highest line-of-sight (LoS) velocity relative to an observer located in the Solar System. However, this feature remains unexplained. Aims. We ran a cosmological "zoom-in" chemodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-type galaxy, including the production and decays of radioactive nuclei in a fully self-consistent way. We then analyzed the results to follow the evolution of Al-26 throughout the lifetime of the simulated galaxy to provide a new method for interpreting the Al-26 observations. Methods. We included the massive star sources of Al-26 in the Galaxy and its radioactive decay into a state-of-the-art galactic chemical evolution model, coupled with cosmological growth and hydrodynamics. This approach allowed us to follow the spatial and temporal evolution of the Al-26 content in the simulated galaxy. Results. Our results are in agreement with the observations with respect to the fact that gas particles in the simulation with relatively higher Al-26 content also have the highest LoS velocities. On the other hand, gas particles with relatively lower Al-26 content (i.e., not bright enough to be observed) generally display the lowest LoS velocities. However, this result is not conclusive because the overall rotational velocity of our simulated galaxy is higher than that observed for cold CO gas in the Milky Way Galaxy. Furthermore, we found no significant correlation between gas temperature, rotational velocity, and Al-26 content at any given radius. We also [...]

 - **Abstract**
 Recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets highlight the highly dynamic nature of the solar atmosphere. They have been named as ''light walls'' or ''peacock jets'' in high-resolution observations. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanisms responsible for the generation of recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets utilizing data from the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory, along with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). These jets appear as dark elongated structures in H$\alpha$ wing images, persist for over an hour, and are located in the intergranular lanes between a pair of same-polarity sunspots. Our analysis reveals that magnetic flux cancellation at the jet base plays a crucial role in their formation. HMI line-of-sight magnetograms show a gradual decrease in opposite-polarity fluxes spanning the sequence of jets in H$\alpha$ - 0.8 angstrom images, suggesting that recurrent magnetic reconnection, likely driven by recurrent miniature flux-rope eruptions that are built up and triggered by flux cancellation, powers these jets. Additionally, magnetic field extrapolations reveal a 3D magnetic null-point topology at the jet formation site $\sim$1.25 Mm height. Furthermore, we observed strong brightening in AIA 304 angstrom channel above the neutral line. Based on our observations and extrapolation results, we propose that these recurrent chromospheric fan-shaped jets align with the minifilament eruption model previously proposed for coronal jets. Though our study focuses on fan-shaped jets in between same-polarity sunspots, similar mechanism might be responsible for light bridge-associated fan-shaped jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Using over 170,000 red clump stars selected from LAMOST and APOGEE, we conduct a detailed analysis of the stellar $V_{Z}$ as a function of $L_{Z}$ (or $R_{g}$) across different $\phi$ bins for various disk populations. The $V_{Z}$ of the whole RC sample stars exhibits a wave-like pattern superimposed on an exponentially increasing trend, indicating the contribution from disk warp, disk flare and disk waves. Our results across various populations suggest that the thin disk is similar to the whole RC sample behavior, while the thick disk displays a wave-like pattern superimposed on a linearly increasing trend, meaning that the features of disk warp and waves are present in both thin and thick disks, and the disk flare feature is only present in the thin disk. These results indicate that the disk warp is potentially driven by secular processes like disk perturbations from intergalactic magnetic fields and a misaligned dark halo. The line-of-node (LON) of the disk warp of various populations displays a slight difference, with $\phi_{0}$ = 5.68 $\pm$ 2.91 degree for the whole RC sample stars, $\phi_{0}$ = 5.78 $\pm$ 2.89 degree for the thin disk stars, and $\phi_{0}$ = 4.10 $\pm$ 3.43 degree for the thick disk stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dense cores are unique among the structures found in the interstellar medium (ISM), as they harbor a rich chemical inventory, including complex organic molecules (COMs), which will be inherited by future evolutionary stages. These molecules exist both in the gas phase and as ices accreted onto grain surfaces. To model these environments, we present Pegasis, a new, fast, and extensible three-phase astrochemical code to explore the chemistry of cold cores, with an emphasis on the role of diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry in shaping their gas and grain chemical compositions. We incorporated the 2024 KIDA chemical network and compared our results with current astrochemical models. Using a traditional rate-equation-based approach, we implemented both diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry, coupled with either an inert or chemically active ice mantle. We identify crucial reactions that enhance the production of COMs through non-diffusive mechanisms on the grain surface as well as the mechanisms through which they can accumulate in the gas phase. Across all models with non-diffusive chemistry, we observe a definite enhancement in the concentration of COMs on both the grain surface as well as in the grain mantle. Finally, our model broadly reproduces the observed abundances of multiple gas-phase species in the cold dense core TMC-1 (CP) and provides insights into its chemical age. Our work demonstrates the capabilities of Pegasis in exploring a wide range of grain-surface chemical processes and modeling approaches for three-phase chemistry in the ISM, providing robust explanations for observed abundances in TMC-1 (CP). In particular, it highlights the role of non-diffusive chemistry in the production of gas-phase COMs on grain surfaces, which are subsequently chemically desorbed, especially when the precursors involved in their formation on the surfaces are heavier than atomic hydrogen.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of the IRAM NOEMA Large Program SOLIS, we imaged the protostellar sources SVS13-A and SVS13-B in SiO, SO, CS, and CH3OH at a spatial resolution of 2"-3" (600-900 au). The CS and SO emission traces the 5000 au envelope that hosts the SVS13-A and VLA3 young stellar objects, and CH3OH probes the compact hot corino associated with SVS13-A. In addition, CS blue-shifted emission reveals a molecular shell in the direction of the jet driven by SVS13-A that is revealed by high-velocity SiO, SO and low-velocity H_2 emission. We also imaged the protostellar jet driven by SVS13-B in SiO, and in SO, CS, and CH3OH for the first time as well. The molecules peak at different distances from the driving source: SiO(2-1) peaks at about 1600 au, and SO(2_3-1_2), CS(2--1) and CH3OH(2_k,k-1_k,k) peak at about 2000-2850 au. Moreover, SiO(2-1) emits at larger distances than SiO(5--4), indicating a lower excitation at a larger distance from the protostar. The multi-species observations revealed a stratified chemical structure in the jet of SVS13-B. A jet-like component with a transversal size < 450 au is traced by SiO, which is efficiently formed in high-velocity shocks (> 25 km/s) by sputtering and vaporisation of the grain cores and mantles. A slower and wider (transversal size of about 750 au) component is probed by methanol, which is released from dust mantles at lower shock velocities (< 10 km/s). The SO and CS emission traces an intermediate component with respect to the components probed by SiO and CH3OH. High spatial resolution imaging (down to 10 au) of the jet of SVS13-B in multiple species will aid in reconstructing the chemistry of shocked material in protostellar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of observed planetary systems, including our solar system, as well as their diversity is still an open question. Streaming instability (SI) is an important mechanism for the formation of gravitationally bound planetesimals, which can grow to form planetary embryos and eventually planets. Snow lines in a protoplanetary disk can assist this process, as they can form pressure maxima and promote both dust accumulation and growth. Since the sublimation of a volatile is gradual due to opacity changes, a snow line in a protoplanetary disk is in fact a radially extended "snow region" of constant temperature. Regály et al. (2021) showed that the dust can affect the disk viscosity by adsorption of charged particles and a small perturbation in gas can lead to excitation of multiple small-scale Rossby vortices. Here we investigate the possibility of excitation of Rossby vortices and rapid planetesimal formation at temperature substructures associated with the snow regions, with the help of global, two dimensional, gas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations, which include dust feedback and self-gravity. We find that an initial temperature substructure in a protoplanetary disk can seed a rapid cascade of long-lived, self-sustaining Rossby vortices. The vortices accumulate significant amount of dust and the local conditions are favorable for streaming instability as well as gravitational collapse. However, the vortex formation via this mechanism requires sufficient decoupling between dust and gas, and such conditions may not be satisfied at early time when the disk is dense in gas, resulting in a delayed onset of vortex formation. The self-sustaining Rossby vortices offer exceptionally favorable conditions for dust growth and formation of planetesimals, as well as a possible pathway for rapid formation of planetary cores.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate dwarf satellite systems around Milky Way analogs in the NewHorizon simulation. Using simple estimators limiting over-detection, we identify planes of satellites comparable to observations in $30\%$ to $70\%$ of cases. The full sample is strongly biased towards arrangements more elongated and co-rotating than their dark-matter host, as early as $z = 1$. We identify cosmic filaments and relics of local gas streams outside each system at $z \approx 0$ with DisPerSE. We find that the thinner the local stream plane, the thinner the system is. The two align significantly for planar systems. Streams around isotropic systems are not planar. Our analysis reveals two plane types. Ultrathin planes lie orthogonally to their single nearest cosmic filament and align to coherent vortical flows within 3 Mpc, reminiscent of $z > 2$ whirls. A second group of planar systems align to their cosmic filaments. All planes are found in single cosmic filaments skirted by coherent vortical whirls while isotropic systems are found in turbulent flows at the intersection of filaments. We conclude that planes are frequent in $\Lambda CDM$ simulations providing the cosmic environment is resolved. Tracking filaments back in time, we show a tight connection between a single, stable filament down to $z \approx 0$ and the existence of a plane. "In-filament" planes typically get enhanced by a single, edge-on filament merger at $z < 2$ (zipper) while "vertical" planes' filaments undergo single twisters (high-orbital momentum zippers) preventing the formation of a core along the filament. In contrast, isotropic systems' filaments undergo multiple misaligned mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemical tagging is a central pursuit of galactic archaeology, but requires sufficiently discriminative abundances to uniquely identify sites of star formation. This task is complicated by intrinsic scatter among conatal stars, inter-element correlations, imprecise abundance measurements, and systematics across stellar evolutionary states. In this work, we formalize the abundance correlation structure of the disk by quantifying the amplitude of information in individual element abundances once a subset is known, and map inter-element residual correlations to uncover hidden signatures of nucleosynthesis. We use two datasets of 79 (593) stars across $-0.15<\rm [Fe/H]<0.13$ ($-1<\rm [Fe/H]<0.41$) with measurements of 30 (19) element abundances of solar neighborhood stars, including 11 (7) light and $\alpha$, 7 (3) Fe-peak, and 12 (9) neutron capture elements. With a simple linear regression model, we predict most $\alpha$ and Fe-peak element abundances within 0.03~dex ($\sim7\%$), and neutron capture elements within 0.05~dex ($\sim10\%$). Including first and second peak s-process elements as predictors improves most neutron capture element predictions to within 0.02~dex (5\%), although no predictive power is gained by including an r-process element. We uncover strong (anti-)correlations in small residual abundances between and within element families. Our finding that disk abundance space is rigidly coupled, from light to heavy elements, implies chemical tagging is infeasible at $>2\%$ precision for $\sim$30 elements. However, the residual structure encodes fingerprints of star formation history, inherited from nucleosynthesis and environmental variations, and provides critical constraints for chemical evolution models. Future disk surveys must achieve sub-2-5\% precision in 30+ elements to access this independent information.
