 - **Abstract**
 2MASS 1207 b, the first directly imaged planetary-mass companion, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of exoplanets and brown dwarfs over the past 20 years. We have performed extensive atmospheric retrieval analyses of 2MASS 1207 b's JWST/NIRSpec spectrum using petitRADTRANS and a new atmospheric inhomogeneity framework, which characterizes homogeneous atmospheres, patchy clouds, cloud-free hot spots, or the combination of patchy clouds and spots. Among 24 retrieval runs with various assumptions, the most statistically preferred model corresponds to the patchy cloud scheme, with Teff$=1174^{+4}_{-3}$ K, log(g)=$3.62^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ dex, and R$=1.399^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, along with near-solar atmospheric compositions of [M/H]$=-0.05\pm0.03$ dex and C/O$=0.440\pm0.012$. This model suggests ~9% of 2MASS 1207 b's atmosphere is covered by thin iron clouds, producing L-dwarf-like spectra, while the remaining 91% consists of thick silicate and iron clouds, emitting blackbody-like spectra. These thin-cloud and thick-cloud regions resemble Jupiter's belts and zones, respectively; this scenario is consistently supported by other retrieval runs incorporating inhomogeneous atmospheres. We demonstrate that 2MASS 1207 b's weak CO absorption can be explained by the veiling effects of patchy thick clouds; the absence of 3.3um CH4 absorption is attributed to its hot thermal structure, which naturally leads to a CO-dominant, CH4-deficient atmosphere. The retrieved atmospheric models also match the observed variability amplitudes of 2MASS 1207 b. Our analysis reveals that the inferred atmospheric properties show significant scatter in less statistically preferred retrieval runs but converge to consistent values among the preferred ones. This underscores the importance of exploring diverse assumptions in retrievals to avoid biased interpretations of atmospheres and formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The spectrum of a galaxy is a complicated convolution of many properties of the galaxy, such as the star formation history (SFH), initial mass function, and metallicity. Inferring galaxy properties from the observed spectrum via spectral synthesis modeling is thus challenging. In particular, a simple yet flexible model for the SFH is required to obtain unbiased inferences. In this paper, we use SFHs from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations to test SFH models in their capabilities of describing the simulated SFHs and the spectra generated from them. In addition to some commonly used SFH models ($\Gamma$, $\tau$, and non-parametric), we also examine a model developed from the principal component analysis (PCA) trained by a set of SFHs from IllustrisTNG. We find that when using the first 5 principal components (eigen-histories), the PCA-based model can achieve a good balance between simplicity and accuracy. Among all the SFH models, the PCA-based model is the best in matching the simulated SFHs. To accurately reproduce the spectra generated from the simulated SFHs, it is necessary to have a degree of freedom to describe the most recent SFH (e.g., a step function covering the age of 0 - 0.3 Gyr). Overall, the PCA+step model performs the best in covering the diversity of SFHs and in reproducing the input spectra, thus providing a reliable SFH model for spectral synthesis modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a sub-Eddington circumbinary disk (CBD) around an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass of $2\,\times\,10^7\,M_{\odot}$ on a circular orbit, separated by 100$\,GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation leads to a denser, thinner, and more filamentary disk compared to non-radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation, primarily due to reduced pressure support and an altered equation of state. The RMHD disk also features $\sim 3$ times lower accretion rate ($\approx 0.15\,\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), weaker accretion streams and a less pronounced overdensity (a.k.a., ``lump") at the inner edge. Our analysis of the light curves and thermal spectra reveals that the variability induced by the binary-CBD interaction is distinguishable in the optical/UV band, where CBD shines at about $1\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. These findings underscore the crucial role of radiation on the structure and observational properties of CBDs around massive black hole binaries and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors, and for heavier binaries that are Pulsar Timing Array sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a large-scale spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis for young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion star formation complex (OSFC) to derive key physical parameters; temperature, luminosity, mass, and age, using SED models. Our goal is to establish a statistically robust characterization of the stellar population and its evolutionary state across the entire complex. We utilize a set of new radiative transfer model SEDs that span a variety of geometries and parameter spaces. These SEDs are fitted to multi-wavelength photometric data from optical to submillimeter wavelengths. We conducted SED fitting on a sample of 15,396 sources. Among these, 5,062 have at least a reliable AllWISE W3 (12~$\mu$m) detection at longer wavelengths, and 63 have sub-millimeter detections in APEX/SABOCA at 350~$\mu$m or APEX/LABOCA at 870~$\mu$m. The resulting physical parameters are cross-referenced with stellar evolutionary tracks to ensure consistency with theoretical predictions. Sources placed on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram show distinct evolutionary sequences. The results are provided with varying levels of completeness and reliability, depending on the available data for each source. The catalog includes quality indicators such as the flux code, which represents the longest detected wavelength for each source, as well as Prob_W3 and Prob_W4 values that quantify the reliability of the AllWISE W3 and W4 detections. All results, including SED fitting outcomes, uncertainty estimates, and source metadata, are publicly available in a comprehensive CDS table. This dataset provides a statistically significant view of the evolutionary processes within the OSFC. The publicly accessible dataset offers a valuable resource for future studies on star and planet formation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this second paper on the variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we focus on the 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a 980 day periodic variability with strange characteristics: 'triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. We speculate this to be a wide but eccentric binary with the same orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of 700 days and 230 days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at 1.18 hours which can either be from a close inner binary or pulsational origin. We present CTSS 2 and PN K 3-5 which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPN known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. These appear to be late thermal pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase, though alternative explanations are possible. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1 showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. We think that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of the solar atmosphere in cool extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lines have reported the prevalence of coronal rain falling from coronal cloud filaments that are associated with the magnetic dips of coronal X-point structures. These filaments mysteriously appear as clouds of mass in the corona that subsequently shrink and disappear due to mass losses that drain as coronal rain along arced field lines. Using a two and a half dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic model, we investigated evaporation-condensation as the formation mechanism of the subset of coronal cloud filaments that form above coronal X-points. Our simulation included the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and used the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to model the formation, maintenance, and mass loss of a filament above a coronal X-point. This paper presents a physical model that demonstrates magnetic reconnection as a filament loss mechanism, producing hybrid filament/coronal rain via mass losses through the X-point. A detailed analysis of how the mass of the filament forces the field to reconnect is also presented, revealing three phases that characterize the evolution of the reconnecting current sheet and associated mass losses. We conclude that the formation of certain coronal cloud filaments and subsequent mass losses via coronal rain can be explained by the evaporation-condensation model combined with filament mass losses forced by magnetic reconnection. We also report that rebound shocks generated by the impact of coronal rain condensations on the chromosphere together with retractive upflows can cause upward propagating condensations to form through a dynamic thermal runaway process.

 - **Abstract**
 Sparked by the asteroseismic space revolution, ensemble studies have been used to produce empirical relations linking observed seismic properties and fundamental stellar properties. Cluster stars are particularly valuable because they have the same metallicity, distance, and age, thus reducing scatter to reveal smoother relations. We present the first study of a cluster that spans the full evolutionary sequence from subgiants to core helium-burning red giants using asteroseismology to characterise the stars in M67, including a yellow straggler. We use Kepler/K2 data to measure seismic surface gravity, examine the potential influence of core magnetic fields, derive an empirical expression for the seismic surface term, and determine the phase term $\epsilon$ of the asymptotic relation for acoustic modes, extending its analysis to evolutionary states previously unexplored in detail. Additionally, we calibrate seismic scaling relations for stellar mass and radius, and quantify their systematic errors if surface term corrections are not applied to state-of-the-art stellar models. Our masses show that the Reimers mass loss parameter can not be larger than $\eta$ $\sim$ 0.23 at the 2-$\sigma$ level. We use isochrone models designed for M67 and compare their predictions with individual mode frequencies. We find that the seismic masses for subgiants and red giant branch stars align with the isochrone-predicted masses as per their luminosity and colour. However, our results are inconsistent with the mass of one of the stellar components of an eclipsing binary system near the TAMS. We use traditional seismic $\chi^2$ fits to estimate a seismic cluster age of 3.95 $\pm$ 0.35 Gyrs.

 - **Abstract**
 This study develops a robust framework for exoplanet characterization by leveraging asteroseismic constraints on host stars. Using precise photometric data from missions such as \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS}, we derive stellar parameters, including mass, radius, and age, with high accuracy through asteroseismic analysis. These stellar parameters are incorporated as priors in a Bayesian framework to refine planetary properties such as mass, radius, and orbital parameters. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we extract posterior distributions of planetary parameters, achieving significant improvements in precision and reliability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with evolved host stars, where precise stellar properties are essential for resolving uncertainties in planetary characterization. The results demonstrate the importance of asteroseismology in bridging stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, enabling detailed studies of planetary system architectures and their dependence on host star properties. Our methodology underscores the synergy between stellar and planetary studies, paving the way for future research on exoplanet populations. This work provides a foundation for utilizing data from upcoming missions like \textit{PLATO}, ensuring continued advancements in the precision and scope of exoplanet characterization.

 - **Abstract**
 From observations, column density ratios or integrated intensity ratios between some species exhibit monotonic increase or decrease along with the evolution of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs). Such ratios are defined as chemical clocks, which can be used to constrain the evolutionary stage. We performed chemical simulations to reproduce the observed column density ratio of HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of these two species across various evolutionary stages in HMSFRs. Simultaneously, we identified the chemical processes responsible for the observed time-dependent trends in these stages. Our simulations utilized the astrochemical code Nautilus and the existing 1D models of HMSFRs that cover four evolutionary stages, accompanied by variations in density and temperature throughout the entire evolution. When averaging over large spatial scales, the best model produced successfully matches the observed column density ratio of HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of the species involved at specific times for each evolutionary stage; that is, the late high-mass starless core stage, the early high-mass protostellar object stage, and the early ultracompact HII stage. HC3N is mainly affected by the warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC) and its own thermal desorption, while N2H+ is primarily influenced by the thermal desorption of N2, CO, CH4, NH3, and H2O followed by dissociative recombination and ion-molecule reactions. The results obtained from the best-fitting model timescales broadly agree with statistical estimates. Based on our best-fit model, we further examined other 350 ratios involving 27 species, and 178 ratios exhibit an increasing or decreasing evolutionary trend around the best-fit timescales of HC3N/N2H+. Among them, 157 ratios are observable and could be considered as candidate chemical clocks.

 - **Abstract**
 SN~2022pul gains special attention due to its possible origin of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass white dwarf explosion (or called a 03fg-like type Ia supernova), which shows prominent [O\,{\sc i}], [Ne\,{\sc i}], and [Ca\,{\sc ii}] lines in its late-time spectra taken at $\sim+$300 days after the peak brightness. In this paper, we present new optical observations for this peculiar object, extending up to over 500 days after the peak brightness. In particular, in the $t\approx+515$ days spectrum, we identified for the first time the presence of narrow emission from [C\,{\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda9824, 9850$, which appears asymmetric and quite similar to the accompanied [O\,{\sc i}] $\lambda6300$ line in strength and profile. Based on the violent merger model that accounts well for previous observations but leaves little carbon in the center of the ejecta, this carbon line can be reproduced by increasing the degree of clumping in the ejecta and setting the carbon mass the same as that of oxygen ($\sim$0.06 $M_{\odot}$) in the innermost region ($\lesssim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$). In principle, the central carbon could come from the secondary white dwarf (WD) if it is ignited when hit by the shockwave of the explosion of the primary WD and explodes as a Ca-rich supernova, whereas pure deflagration of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass WD can account for such unburnt carbon more naturally.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies for inferring the global characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from its multipoint local in situ observations have been undertaken earlier, but there are limited studies utilizing measurements from multiple spacecraft with sufficiently small radial and angular separations. In the present study, we investigate a magnetic cloud (MC) region of a CME observed in situ during 2023 September 24-26, at STEREO-A and Wind spacecraft near 1 AU, which had radial and angular separations of 0.03 AU and 3.4 degrees, respectively. We examine the disparities in the estimates of the arrival times of CME substructures, the MC axis, and its orientation between the two spacecraft. We also propose an approach for identifying the MC axis's arrival and have compared it with the arrival of the size/time center to understand the non-isotropic compression of the MC along its angular extent. Using minimum variance analysis (MVA), we note that the orientation of the MC is slightly out-of-ecliptic at Wind but not at STEREO-A. We also compare the magnetic field parameters over the start to end of the MC at both spacecraft and note a significant non-coherency in the MC towards its trailing portion. Our analysis confirms that MC has a stronger rear side compression at STEREO-A than at Wind, with its trailing edge arriving later at Wind. Our study highlights substantial differences in CME characteristics even at mesoscales across the angular extent, and therefore, one needs to analyze several such cases to better understand the flux rope structure.
#### Some musings on erythrogigantoacoustics

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of stars other than the Sun are sensitive to oscillations of only low degree. Many are high-order acoustic modes. Acoustic frequencies of main-sequence stars, for example, satisfy a well-known pattern, which some astronomers have adopted even for red-giant stars. That is not wise, because the internal structures of these stars can be quite different from those on the Main Sequence, which is populated by stars whose structure is regular. Here I report on pondering this matter, and point out two fundamental deviations from the commonly adopted relation. There are aspects of the regular relation that are connected in a simple way to gross properties of the star, such as the dependence of the eigenfrequencies on the linear combination $n+\textstyle{\frac {1}{2}}l$ of the order $n$ and degree $l$, which is characteristic of a regular spherical acoustic cavity. That is not a feature of red-giant frequencies, because, as experienced by the waves, red-giant stars appear to have (phantom) singular centres, which substantially modify the propagation of waves. That requires a generalization of the eigenfrequency relation, which I present here. When fitted to the observed frequencies of the Sun, the outcome is consistent with the Sun being round, with no singularity in the core. That is hardly novel, but at least it provides some assurance that our understanding of stellar acoustic wave dynamics is on a sound footing.
#### Unveiling What Makes Saturn Ring: Quantifying the Amplitudes of Saturn's Planetary Normal-Mode Oscillations and Trends in C-Ring Properties Using Kronoseismology (VII)

 - **Abstract**
 Certain spiral density waves in Saturn's rings are generated through resonances with planetary normal modes, making them valuable probes of Saturn's internal structure. Previous research has primarily focused on the rotation rates of these waves. However, other characteristics of these waves also contain valuable information about the planet's interior. In this work, we investigate the amplitudes of the waves across the C-ring by analyzing high signal-to-noise profiles derived from phase-corrected averages of occultation profiles obtained by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). By fitting these wave profiles to linear density wave models, we estimate the ring's surface mass density, mass extinction coefficient and effective kinematic viscosity at 34 locations in the C-ring, as well as the amplitude of the gravitational potential perturbations associated with 6 satellite resonances and 28 planetary normal mode resonances. Our estimates of the C-ring's mass extinction coefficient, indicate that the typical particle mass density is around 0.3 g/cm^3 interior to 84,000 km, but can get as low as 0.03 g/cm^3 exterior to 84,000 km. We also find the ring's viscosity is reduced in the outer C-ring, which is consistent with the exceptionally high porosity of the particles in this region. Meanwhile, we find the amplitudes of Saturn's normal modes are complex functions of frequency, l and m, implying that multiple factors influence how efficiently these modes are excited. This analysis identified two primary sources of these normal-mode oscillations: a deep source located close to Saturn's core, and a shallow source residing near the surface.
