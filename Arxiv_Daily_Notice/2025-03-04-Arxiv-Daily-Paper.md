 - **Abstract**
 Context. Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus is considered the last major merger that contributed to the formation of the Milky Way. Its remnants dominate the nearby accreted stellar halo of the Milky Way. Aim. We aim to characterise the star formation history of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus through the age and metallicity of its stellar populations. Methods. From Gaia DR3 data, we dynamically define three Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus samples with different criteria and possible degrees of contamination from other substructures in the halo. Then, we derive the stellar age and metallicity distributions using the this http URL package. Results. We identify three main populations of stars and a fourth smaller one following an almost linear age-[M/H] relation. The three oldest populations correspond to the bulk of the star formation that lasted for, at least, $\sim$3-4 Gyr and ended about 10 Gyr ago, its metallicities ranging from $-$1.7 to $-$0.8. We categorise these populations into two main epochs: the evolution of GSE in isolation and the merger event. This separation finds independent support from the age-metallicty relation of GSE globular clusters (Aguado-Agelet et al., subm.). The fourth population is younger and more metal-rich, at $\sim$8.5 Gyr and [M/H]$\sim-0.4$; its link to GSE is unclear.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence is a mysterious phenomenon of physical systems and plays a critical role in the interstellar medium (ISM). We present a thermodynamic perspective on turbulence, aiming to explain the origin of the variance (\(\sigma^2\)) of the lognormal probability density function (PDF) of gas density caused by turbulence. By introducing a virtual dissipation process, in which the entropy-increasing processes of turbulent dissipation and structural dissipation are assumed to be coupled, we directly derive the empirical relation between the variance of the (near) log-normal PDF ($\sigma^2$) and the Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$): $\sigma^2 = \ln(1 + b^2\mathcal{M})^2$. We also explain why $b = 1$ for compressive forcing and $b = 1/D$ for solenoidal forcing, where $D$ is the dimension of the system. Furthermore, by introducing a delay parameter $q$ for the local gas temperature, we quantitatively derive the deviation of $\sigma^2$ from the empirical relation at high $\mathcal{M}$, which is consistent with previous simulations and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the potential of a pre-trained visual transformer (VT) model, specifically the Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2), to classify photometric light curves without the need for feature extraction or multi-band preprocessing. The goal is to assess whether this image-based approach can accurately differentiate astronomical phenomena and serve as a viable option for working with multi-band photometric light curves. We transformed each multi-band light curve into an image. These images serve as input to the SwinV2 model, which is pre-trained on ImageNet-21K. The datasets employed include the public Catalog of Variable Stars from the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) survey, using both one and two bands, and the first round of the recent Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), which includes six bands. The performance of the model was evaluated on six classes for the MACHO dataset and 20 distinct classes of variable stars and transient events for the ELAsTiCC dataset. The fine-tuned SwinV2 achieved better performance than models specifically designed for light curves, such as Astromer and the Astronomical Transformer for Time Series and Tabular Data (ATAT). When trained on the full MACHO dataset, it attained a macro F1-score of 80.2 and outperformed Astromer in single-band experiments. Incorporating a second band further improved performance, increasing the F1-score to 84.1. In the ELAsTiCC dataset, SwinV2 achieved a macro F1-score of 65.5, slightly surpassing ATAT by 1.3.

 - **Abstract**
 The atmospheres of planets between the size of Earth and Neptune at short orbital periods have been under intense scrutiny. Of the ~dozen planets in this regime with atmospheres studied so far, a few appear to have prominent molecular features while others appear relatively void of detectable atmospheres. Further work is therefore needed to understand the atmospheres of these planets, starting with observing a larger sample. To this end, we present the 3-5 micron transmission spectrum of TOI-776 c, a warm (Teq ~420 K), ~2 Rearth, ~7 Mearth planet orbiting an M1V star, measured with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. By combining two visits, we measure a median transit precision of ~18 ppm and ~32 ppm in the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, respectively. We compare the transmission spectrum to both non-physical and physical models, and find no strong evidence for molecular features. For cloud-top pressures larger than 10^-3 bar, we rule out atmospheric metallicities less than 180-240x solar (depending on the reduction and modeling technique), which corresponds to a mean molecular weight of ~6-8 g/mol. However, we find simple atmosphere mixture models (H2O+H2/He or CO2+H2/He) give more pessimistic constraints, and caution that mean molecular weight inferences are model dependent. We compare TOI-776 c to the similar planet TOI-270 d, and discuss possible options for further constraining TOI-776 c's atmospheric composition. Overall, we suggest these TOI-776 c observations may represent a combination of planetary and stellar parameters that fall just below the threshold of detectable features in small planet spectra; finding this boundary is one of the main goals of the COMPASS program.
#### Surveying the Giant HII Regions of the Milky Way with SOFIA: VII. Galactic Center Regions Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C

 - **Abstract**
 This study examines the mid-infrared properties of Giant HII (GHII) regions in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) -- Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C -- using SOFIA-FORCAST imaging at 25 and 37 microns. It compares these mid-infrared data with previous multi-wavelength observations to explore their present star formation activity and global properties. The study identifies 77 massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates in and around the three regions. Sgr B2 appears to host the youngest MYSOs and have much higher extinction than the other regions, containing several radio sources not detected in the mid-infrared even at 37 microns. Meanwhile, cm radio continuum regions of Sgr B1 shows remarkable correspondence to its mid-infrared emission. Sgr C has fewer confirmed MYSOs, and seems to have a higher fraction of low-mass young stellar objects and contamination from more evolved interloper/foreground stars. Derived MYSO densities are consistent with GHII regions elsewhere in the Galactic plane, though the CMZ GHII regions appear to have less prolific present star formation overall. Unlike Sgr B2, the cm continuum emission in Sgr B1 and Sgr C GHII regions appears to be absent cold dust and molecular gas, suggesting environmental differences, possibly driven by turbulence and rapid dynamical changes near the Galactic Center. Furthermore, unlike typical GHII regions, Sgr B1 and Sgr C are significantly ionized by evolved interloper stars, which likely did not form within these regions. In these ways, Sgr B1 and Sgr C deviate from classical GHII region behavior, thus potentially representing a new category of GHII region or challenging their classification as GHII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the magnitude of the bias due to non-Gaussian extragalactic foregrounds on the optimal reconstruction of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential and temperature power spectra. The reconstruction is performed using a Bayesian inference method known as the marginal unbiased score expansion (MUSE). We apply MUSE to a minimum variance combination of multifrequency maps drawn from the Agora publicly available simulations of the lensed CMB and correlated extragalactic foreground emission. Taking noise levels appropriate to two years of data with the SPT-3G instrument on the South Pole Telescope, we find no statistically significant bias in the MUSE reconstruction when limited to angular multipoles $\ell \leq 3000$. We find a 4.7$\sigma$ bias in the recovered lensing potential power spectrum when smaller scale modes ($\ell \leq 3500$) are included. This work is a first step toward understanding the impact of extragalactic foregrounds on optimal reconstructions of CMB temperature and lensing potential power spectra.
#### Probing the interstellar medium toward GRB 221009A through X-ray dust scattering

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of 21 X-ray dust-scattering rings around the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A provides a unique opportunity to study the interstellar medium (ISM) through which the X-ray radiation traveled in our Galaxy and, by difference, in the host galaxy as well. In particular, since the ring intensity and radius at a given time depend on the amount of dust and on its distance, respectively XMM-Newton and Swift images allowed us to map the ISM around the direction of the GRB with better resolution than in the existing optical and infrared-based 3D dust maps, both in the plane of the sky (few arcminutes) and along the line of sight (from $\simeq 1$ pc for dust clouds within 1 kpc to $\simeq 100$ pc for structures at distances larger than 10 kpc). As a consequence, we can revise prior estimates of the GRB soft X-ray fluence, obtaining a $\sim$35\% lower value, which, however, still indicates a substantial excess with respect to the extrapolation of the spectral models constrained by hard X-ray observations. Additionally, we detect significant spectral variability in two azimuthal sectors of the X-ray rings, which can be fully attributed to different Galactic absorption in these two directions. The comparison of the total hydrogen column density inferred from spectral fitting, with the Galactic contribution derived from the intensity of the X-ray rings, in the same sectors, allowed us to more robustly constrain the absorption in the host galaxy to $N_{\rm{H,z=0.151}}= (3.7\pm0.3)\,\times\,10^{21}\,\rm{cm^{-2}}$. This result is relevant not only to characterize the ISM of the host galaxy and to understand how the GRB radiation might have affected it, but also to model the broad-band spectrum of the GRB afterglow and to constrain the properties of a possible underlying supernova.

 - **Abstract**
 The mechanisms responsible for chemical depletion across diverse astrophysical environments are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we investigate chemical depletion in post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars hosting second-generation transition discs using high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT. We performed a detailed chemical abundance analysis of 6 post-AGB/post-RGB stars and 6 post-AGB/post-RGB candidates with transition discs in the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances were obtained through 1D LTE analysis of chemical elements from C to Eu, and 1D NLTE corrections were incorporated for elements from C to Fe. Our results confirmed that depletion efficiency, traced by the [S/Ti] abundance ratio, is higher in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs compared to the overall sample of post-AGB/post-RGB binaries. We also examined correlations between derived abundances and binary system parameters (astrometric, photometric, orbital, pulsational). Additionally, we compared the depletion patterns in our sample to those observed in young stars with transition discs and in the interstellar medium. We confirmed that the depletion is significantly stronger in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs than in young stars with transition discs. Furthermore, we found that [X/Zn] abundance ratio trends of volatile and refractory elements in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs generally resemble similar trends in the interstellar medium (except for trends of [Si/Zn] and [Mg/Zn] ratios). These findings, although based on a limited sample, provide indirect constraints for depletion mechanism in circumbinary discs around post-AGB/post-RGB stars.
#### JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21281

 - **Abstract**
 While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.
