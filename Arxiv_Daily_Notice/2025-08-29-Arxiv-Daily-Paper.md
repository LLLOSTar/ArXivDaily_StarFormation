 - **Abstract**
 FAST observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by VLA and GBT observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar counterpart with 99.5$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars and planets form within cold, dark molecular clouds. In these dense regions, where starlight cannot penetrate, cosmic rays (CRs) are the dominant source of ionization -- driving interstellar chemistry(Dalgarno (2006, PNAS, 103, 12269)), setting the gas temperature(Goldsmith et al. (1969, ApJ, 158, 173)), and enabling coupling to magnetic fields(McKee & Ostriker (2007, ARA&A, 45, 565; arXiv:0707.3514)). Together, these effects regulate the collapse of clouds and the onset of star formation. Despite this importance, the cosmic-ray ionization rate, $\zeta$, has never been measured directly. Instead, this fundamental parameter has been loosely inferred from indirect chemical tracers and uncertain assumptions, leading to published values that span nearly two orders of magnitude and limiting our understanding of star formation physics. Here, we report the first direct detection of CR-excited vibrational H$_2$ emission, using \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) observations of the starless core Barnard 68 (B68). The observed emission pattern matches theoretical predictions for CR excitation precisely, confirming a decades-old theoretical proposal long considered observationally inaccessible. This result enables direct measurement of $\zeta$, effectively turning molecular clouds into natural, light-year-sized, cosmic-ray detectors. It opens a transformative observational window into the origin, propagation, and role of cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminosities of pre-main sequence stars evolve during the protoplanetary disc lifetime. This has a significant impact on the heating of their surrounding protoplanetary disks, the natal environments of planets. Moreover, stars of different masses evolve differently. However, this is rarely accounted for in planet formation models. We carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet formation modelling with focus on the impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity evolution on giant planet formation around host stars in the range of $1{-}2.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that giant planet formation is sensitive to the evolution of stellar luminosity, specifically the locations and times at which giant planet formation can occur depend on it. High stellar luminosity causes an increase in the scale height of the gas and pebbles, which may decrease the efficiency of pebble accretion, making it more challenging to form giant planets. This has important consequences for the composition of these giant planets, stressing the need to incorporate such aspects into planet formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances in young G-, K-, and M-type stars (temperatures between 6500 and 3100 K) using infrared APOGEE-2 spectra. Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the Orion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For 340 slow rotators v sini $\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti, and Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS. To mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with infrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar [X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups, suggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\alpha$/Fe] from [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \pm 0.04$, about 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \pm 0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived for Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized gas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to stars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will not only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight into the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.
#### High sensitivity molecular line observations towards the L1544 pre-stellar core challenge current models

 - **Abstract**
 The increased sensitivity and spectral resolution of observed spectra towards the pre-stellar core L1544 are challenging the current physical and chemical models. With the aim of further constraining the structure of L1544 as well as assessing the completeness of chemical networks, we turn to radiative transfer modelling of observed molecular lines towards this source. We obtained high-sensitivity and high-spectral resolution observations of HCO+ (J = 1 - 0), CS (J = 2 - 1), C34S (J = 2 - 1), H2CO (J ,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,1,1), c-C3H2 (J,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,0,1), SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) and 34SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) with the IRAM 30m telescope towards the dust peak of L1544. A non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer code is coupled to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to model the observations. We find that with just one transition for each isotope, the modelling cannot find a global minimum that fits the observations. The derived fractional abundance profiles are compared to those computed with chemical models. The observed transitions trace gas components with distinct dynamics at different distances along the radius of the core. Moreover, the results evidence a poor reproduction of sulphur chemistry by chemical modelling and stresses the need to include a more consistent S-depletion process to accurately reproduce the S-chemistry towards dense cores.
#### Revisiting the Radial Metallicity Gradient-Age Relation in the Milky Way's Thin and Thick Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Galactic disks typically exhibit a negative radial metallicity gradient, indicating faster enrichment in the inner regions. Recent studies report that this gradient becomes flatter with increasing stellar age in the Milky Way's (MW) thin disk, while the thick disk exhibits a mildly positive gradient across all ages. In this work, we revisit the metallicity gradient-age relation (MGAR) in both the thin and thick disks of the MW. We use spectroscopic data from LAMOST DR8 and stellar ages calibrated with asteroseismology. Our results show a steadily flattening MGAR in the thin disk and confirm a positive gradient $\sim0.013\,\mathrm{dex\,kpc^{-1}}$ in the thick disk. The flattening in the thin disk may be caused by large-scale radial migration induced by transient spiral arms, or by a time-dependent steepening of the interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity gradient as suggested by recent FIRE2 simulations. The positive gradient in the thick disk may reflect early enrichment of the outer regions by strong feedback or starburst-driven outflows in a turbulent, gas-rich proto-disk. These findings suggest distinct chemodynamical evolution paths for the MW's thin and thick disks and provide valuable constraints for future models of Galactic chemical evolution.
#### Forecasting 21-cm power spectrum sensitivity to dark Matter-baryon scattering

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20507

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential of upcoming 21-cm interferometric observations to probe interacting dark matter (IDM). We focus on scenarios where the dark matter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\sigma(v) =\sigma_{0} v^n$, with $\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity between dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity dependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n = -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed simulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we forecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical parameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star formation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity. Our results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can significantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor of five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more than an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts also significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave background and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also shows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters associated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction of Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is positively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical role of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust inferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum observations.
#### HSTPROMO Internal Proper Motion Kinematics of Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies: II. Velocity Anisotropy and Dark Matter Cusp Slope of Sculptor

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze three epochs of HST imaging over 20 years for the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, measuring precise proper motions for 119 stars and combining them with 1760 existing line-of-sight velocities. This catalog yields the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on) configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons ($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark matter density slope of $\Gamma_{\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\Gamma_{\rm dark} \leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The results qualitatively agree with $\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or particle masses required by these models, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D distribution of orbital elements. Methods. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion, using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainties estimation and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations according to the latest data and algorithms. Results. This update of the CODE catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using current stellar data, we formulate new constraints for dynamically new comets. Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000 au and discovered before 2022, as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10 au from the Sun during during this period, and over 80% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7 au.
#### Prediction of sulphate hazes in the lower Venus atmosphere

 - **Abstract**
 We study the amount, size distribution and material composition of (sub-)mic aerosol particles in the lower Venus atmosphere < 50 km. Our GGchem phase-equilibrium model predicts metal-chloride and metal-fluoride molecules to be present in the gas over the Venus surface in trace concentrations < 2.E-12, in particular FeCl2, NaCl, KCl and SiF4. Using an improved version of the DiffuDrift model developed by Woitke et al.2020, we find that these molecules deposit to form solid potassium sulphate K2SO4, sodium sulphate Na2SO4, and pyrite FeS2 above about 15.5 km, 9.5 km and 2.4 km, respectively. These heights coincide well with the three potential haze layers found in the Pioneer Venus Large Probe neutral mass spectrometer data by Mogul et al.2023. The particles with radius < 0.3 mic can be dredged up from the ground to reach the sulphuric acid cloud base from below by diffusion. The particle density decreases from ~ 5000/cm3 at ground level to ~100/cm3 at a height of 45 km. Particles larger than about 1 mic are found to stay confined to the ground < 10 km, indicating that the larger, so-called mode 3 particles, if they exist, cannot originate from the surface. All particles are expected to be coated by a thin layer of FeS2, Na2SO4 and K2SO4. We have included the repelling effect of particle charges on the coagulation, without which the model would predict much too steep gradients close to the surface, which is inconsistent with measured opacity data. Our models suggest that the particles must have at least 100 negative charges per micron of particle radius at ground level, and > 50/mic at a height of 45 km.

 - **Abstract**
 $Context.$ The quantification of the terahertz (THz) and IR optical properties of astrophysical ice analogs, which have different molecular compositions, phases, and structural properties, is required to model both the continuum emission by the dust grains covered with thick icy mantles and the radiative transfer in the dense cold regions of the interstellar medium. $Aims.$ We developed a model to define a relationship between the THz$-$IR response and the ice porosity. It includes the reduced effective optical properties of porous ices and the additional wave extinction due to scattering on pores. The model is applied to analyze the measured THz$-$IR response of CO and CO$_2$ laboratory ices and to estimate their scattering properties and porosity. $Methods.$ Our model combines the Bruggeman effective medium theory, the Lorentz-Mie and Rayleigh scattering theories, and the radiative transfer theory to analyze the measured THz$-$IR optical properties of laboratory ices. $Results.$ We apply this model to show that the electromagnetic-wave scattering in studied laboratory ices occurs mainly in the Rayleigh regime at frequencies below 32 THz. We conclude that pores of different shapes and dimensions can be approximated by spheres of effective radius. By comparing the measured broadband response of our laboratory ices with those of reportedly compact ices from earlier studies, we quantify the scattering properties of our CO and CO$_2$ ice samples. Their porosity is shown to be as high as 15% and 22%, respectively. Underestimating the ice porosity in the data analysis leads to a proportional relative underestimate of the THz$-$IR optical constants. $Conclusions.$ The scattering properties and porosity of ices have to be quantified along with their THz$-$IR response in order to adequately interpret astrophysical observations.
#### Unprecedentedly bright X-ray flaring in Cygnus X-1 observed by INTEGRAL

 - **Abstract**
 We study three extraordinarily bright X-ray flares originating from Cyg X-1 seen on 2023 July 10 detected with INTEGRAL. The flares had a duration on the order of only ten minutes each, and within seconds reached a 1-100 keV peak luminosity of $1.1-2.6\times10^{38}$ erg/s. The associated INTEGRAL/IBIS count rate was about ${\sim}$10x higher than usual for the hard state. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong flaring has been seen in Cyg X-1, despite the more than 21 years of INTEGRAL monitoring, with almost ${\sim}$20 Ms of exposure, and the similarly deep monitoring with RXTE/PCA that lasted from 1997 to 2012. The flares were seen in all three X-ray and $\gamma$-ray instruments of INTEGRAL. Radio monitoring by the AMI Large Array with observations 6 h before and 40 h after the X-ray flares did not detect a corresponding increase in radio flux. The shape of the X-ray spectrum shows only marginal change during the flares, i.e., photon index and cut-off energy are largely preserved. The overall flaring behavior points toward a sudden and brief release of energy, either due to the ejection of material in an unstable jet or due to the interaction of the jet with the ambient clumpy stellar wind.
#### HST Deep Upper Limits Rule Out a Surviving Massive Binary Companion to the Type Ic Supernova 2012fh

 - **Abstract**
 Current explanations of the mass-loss mechanism for stripped-envelope supernovae remain divided between single and binary progenitor systems. Here we obtain deep ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Type Ic SN 2012fh to search for the presence of a surviving companion star to the progenitor. We synthesize these observations with archival HST imaging, ground-based spectroscopy, and previous analyses from the literature to provide three independent constraints on the progenitor system. We fit the color-magnitude diagram of the surrounding population to constrain the most likely age of the system to be $<20$ Myr. Analysis of spectra of SN 2012fh provide an estimate of the He core mass of the progenitor star, $>5.6$ M$_{\odot}$. We analyze deep HST images at the precise location after the SN faded to constrain the luminosity of any remaining main-sequence binary companion to be $\log(L/L_{\odot}) \lesssim 3.35$. Combining observational constraints with current binary population synthesis models excludes the presence of a faint stellar companion to SN 2012fh at the $\lesssim10\%$ level. The progenitor was therefore either effectively isolated at the time of explosion or orbited by a black-hole companion. The latter scenario dominates if we only consider models that produce successful supernovae.
