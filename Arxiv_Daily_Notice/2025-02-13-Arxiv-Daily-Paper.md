 - **Abstract**
 Observations of molecular lines are a key tool to determine the main physical properties of prestellar cores. However, not all the information is retained in the observational process or easily interpretable, especially when a larger number of physical properties and spectral features are involved. We present a methodology to link the information in the synthetic spectra with the actual information in the simulated models (i.e., their physical properties), in particular, to determine where the information resides in the spectra. We employ a 1D gravitational collapse model with advanced thermochemistry, from which we generate synthetic spectra. We then use neural network emulations and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a machine learning technique, to connect the models' properties to the specific spectral features. Thanks to interpretable machine learning, we find several correlations between synthetic lines and some of the key model parameters, such as the cosmic-ray ionization radial profile, the central density, or the abundance of various species, suggesting that most of the information is retained in the observational process. Our procedure can be generalized to similar scenarios to quantify the amount of information lost in the real observations. We also point out the limitations for future applicability.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the composition of exoplanets is one of the most promising approaches to observationally constrain planet formation and evolution processes. However, this endeavour is complicated for small exoplanets by the fact that a wide range of compositions is compatible with their bulk properties. To overcome this issue, we identify triangular regions in the mass-radius space where part of this degeneracy is lifted for close-in planets, since low-mass H/He envelopes would not be stable due to high-energy stellar irradiation. Planets in these Hot Water World triangles need to contain at least some heavier volatiles and are therefore interesting targets for atmospheric follow-up observations. We perform a demographic study to show that only few well-characterised planets in these regions are currently known and introduce our CHEOPS GTO programme aimed at identifying more of these potential hot water worlds. Here, we present CHEOPS observations for the first two targets of our programme, TOI-238 b and TOI-1685 b. Combined with TESS photometry and published RVs, we use the precise radii and masses of both planets to study their location relative to the corresponding Hot Water World triangles, perform an interior structure analysis and study the lifetimes of H/He and water-dominated atmospheres under these conditions. We find that TOI-238 b lies, at the 1-sigma level, inside the corresponding triangle. While a pure H/He atmosphere would have evaporated after 0.4-1.3 Myr, it is likely that a water-dominated atmosphere would have survived until the current age of the system, which makes TOI-238 b a promising hot water world candidate. Conversely, TOI-1685 b lies below the mass-radius model for a pure silicate planet, meaning that even though a water-dominated atmosphere would be compatible both with our internal structure and evaporation analysis, we cannot rule out the planet to be a bare core.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the detectability of $\gamma$-ray emission originating from the radioactive decays of unstable nuclei that are synthesized in relativistic outflows launched in magneto-rotational core-collapse supernovae. The observed lines have enhanced energies due to the Lorentz boosted nuclei and can also be seen until later times due to time dilation of the rest-frame half-lives. We find that instruments like $\textit{e-ASTROGAM}$ and $\textit{INTEGRAL/SPI}$ are sensitive to these boosted line emissions from 100s of keV to 10s of MeV at a distance of 10 kpc over time scales of 10s of days. For favorable viewing angles, these decays can be detected to extragalactic distances for rapidly spinning proto-magnetar models. On the other hand, detection for off-axis jets is challenging, even for a supernova at the galactic center. Measuring multiple decay lines in addition to the integrated luminosity over $\sim$10 days post-bounce would allow for the ability to distinguish between models and shed light on central engine properties like magnetic field and spin.

 - **Abstract**
 Ethanolamine (EA), a key component of phospholipids, has recently been detected in the interstellar medium within molecular clouds. To understand this observation, laboratory studies of its formation and destruction are essential and should be complemented by astrochemical models. This study investigates the photostability of EA ice under Lyman (Ly)-$\alpha$ (10.2 eV) irradiation at 10 K, and explores its potential role in the formation of simple and complex organic molecules in molecular clouds. The UV destruction cross section of EA was estimated to be ($4.7\pm0.3)\times10^{-18}$ cm$^2$, providing insight into its half-life of $6.5\times10^{7}$ yr in dense interstellar clouds. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry were used to identify various photoproducts, with their formation pathways discussed. Ethylene glycol and serine were tentatively detected during the warming up process following irradiation, suggesting that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules such as sugars, peptides and their derivatives. High mass signals detected in the mass spectrometer suggest the presence of several complex organic molecules, and further analysis of residues at room temperature is planned for future work. The results suggest that EA could contribute to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space, with implications for the origin of life.

 - **Abstract**
 In high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), the compact object accretes the strong stellar wind of an O-B supergiant companion star. X-ray flux variations alter the stellar wind's ionization state and optical line profiles, which are key in the determination of the orbital parameters of the system. Using the method of Fourier Disentangling, we decomposed the spectral contributions from the stellar atmosphere close to the photosphere and the accreted stream of matter (i.e. the focused wind). High-resolution optical spectroscopy of Cyg X-1 in its hard and soft-intermediate X-ray states revealed state-dependent variability in the line profiles. In both states, we detect H-alpha and He II in both the focused wind and the stellar photosphere, whereas He I is not detected in the focused wind. Additionally, we observe an X-ray/optical anticorrelation, where the lines' intensity decreases in the soft-intermediate state and the lines are more absorbed at the inferior conjunction of the star. These results suggest a stronger wind in the low-hard state and the presence of high-density clumps in the line of sight at the conjunction.

 - **Abstract**
 The old G3V star Kepler-10 is known to host two transiting planets, the ultra-short-period super-Earth Kepler-10b ($P=0.837$ d; $R_{\rm p}=1.47~\rm R_\oplus$) and the long-period sub-Neptune Kepler-10c ($P=45.294$ d; $R_{\rm p}=2.35~\rm R_\oplus$), and a non-transiting planet causing variations in the Kepler-10c transit times. Measurements of the mass of Kepler-10c in the literature have shown disagreement, depending on the radial-velocity dataset and/or the modeling technique used. Here we report on the analysis of almost 300 high-precision radial velocities gathered with the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo over $\sim11$~years, and extracted with the YARARA-v2 tool correcting for possible systematics and/or low-level activity variations at the spectrum level. To model these radial velocities, we used three different noise models and various numerical techniques, which all converged to the solution: $M_{\rm p, b}=3.24 \pm 0.32~\rm M_\oplus$ (10$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, b}=5.54 \pm 0.64~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet b; $M_{\rm p, c}=11.29 \pm 1.24~\rm M_\oplus$ (9$\sigma$) and $\rho_{\rm p, c}=4.75 \pm 0.53~\rm g\;cm^{-3}$ for planet c; and $M_{\rm p, d}\sin{i}=12.00 \pm 2.15~\rm M_\oplus$ (6$\sigma$) and $P=151.06 \pm 0.48$ d for the non-transiting planet Kepler-10d. This solution is further supported by the analysis of the Kepler-10c transit timing variations and their simultaneous modeling with the HARPS-N radial velocities. While Kepler-10b is consistent with a rocky composition and a small or no iron core, Kepler-10c may be a water world that formed beyond the water snowline and subsequently migrated inward.
#### Metis Observations of Alfvénic Outflows Driven by Interchange Reconnection in a Pseudostreamer

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents observations of a large pseudostreamer solar eruption and, in particular, the post-eruption relaxation phase, as captured by Metis onboard the Solar Orbiter on October 12, 2022, during its perihelion passage. Utilizing total brightness data, we observe the outward propagation of helical features up to 3 solar radii along a radial column that appears to correspond to the stalk of the pseudostreamer. The helical structures persisted for more than 3 hours following a jet-like coronal mass ejection associated with a polar crown prominence eruption. A notable trend is revealed: the inclination of these features decreases as their polar angle and height increase. Additionally, we measured their helix pitch. Despite a 2-minute time cadence limiting direct correspondence among filamentary structures in consecutive frames, we find that the Metis helical structure may be interpreted as a consequence of twist (nonlinear torsional Alfvén waves) and plasma liberated by interchange reconnection. A comparison was performed of the helix parameters as outlined by fine-scale outflow features with those obtained from synthetic white-light images derived from the high-resolution magnetohydrodynamics simulation of interchange reconnection in a pseudostreamer topology by Wyper et al. (2022). A remarkable similarity between the simulation-derived images and the observations was found. We conjecture that these Metis observations may represent the upper end in spatial and energy scale of the interchange reconnection process that has been proposed recently as the origin of the Alfvénic solar wind.
#### Reconstructing the Anisotropic Ultra-long Wavelength Spectra using a Single Antenna on Lunar-orbit

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-long wavelength sky ($\nu\lesssim 30$ MHz) is still largely unexplored, as the electromagnetic wave is heavily absorbed and distorted by the ionosphere on Earth. The far-side of the Moon, either in lunar-orbit or on lunar-surface, is the ideal site for observations in this band, and the upcoming Moon-based interferometers will obtain multi-frequency high-resolution sky maps. Making use of the lunar occultation of the sky and the anisotropy of antenna primary beam response, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the ultra-long wavelength spectral shape in multiple directions in the sky using only one antenna on lunar orbit. We apply the method to one antenna on one of the nine daughter satellites of the proposed Discovering the Sky at Longest wavelength (DSL) project. Using simulated observation data between 1 - 30 MHz from one dipole antenna, we find that the spectra for different regions on the sky can be reconstructed very well and the free-free absorption feature in each region can be derived from the reconstructed spectra. This work demonstrates the feasibility to reconstruct the anisotropic ultra-long wavelength spectra with very limited instrumentation on a lunar-orbit, with mature technologies already in place. It extends the application of such kind of satellite in revealing the distribution of free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium from the distribution of absorption features in the ultra-long wavelength sky.
