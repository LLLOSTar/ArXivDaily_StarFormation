#### HD 144812: A transition-phase massive star in a binary system
 - **Authors:** Michalis Kourniotis, Michaela Kraus, Maria Laura Arias, Lydia S. Cidale

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we shed light on the evolutionary phase of HD 144812, a Galactic yellow supergiant showing infrared excess that is typically expected for evolved stars undergoing enhanced mass-loss activity. We present high-resolution spectroscopy of the star in the $H-$ and $K-$band acquired with the GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) and further explore multi-band imaging of the wider field of view from the ultraviolet to the radio regime. The IGRINS data reveal several lines from the hydrogen series and iron in a double-peaked emission and we here suggest, that HD 144812 is orbited by a disk-hosting companion. Furthermore, we report emission in the CO band heads of the star that is modeled to arise from a circum-stellar/binary disk (or ring) of ejected gas. The latter consists of material that is expected to have been dredged up from the core of the star to its surface during a prior phase as a red supergiant (RSG). These findings together suggest that HD 144812 is a rare, post-RSG star in a binary system, encouraging further investigation on the effect that the stellar encounters have on triggering instabilities and driving the evolution of the primary star shortly prior to the supernova event.
#### Unveiling Bifurcated Blue Straggler Sequences in NGC 2173: Insights from Binary Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying bifurcated blue straggler (BS) sequences in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of star clusters has long been regarded as a powerful diagnostic for distinguishing different BS formation mechanisms. While such bifurcations are typically associated with core-collapsed clusters, their detection in dynamically young clusters raises new questions about their origins. In this study, using high-precision proper motion data derived from Hubble Space Telescope multi-epoch observations, we confirm the existence of two distinct BS sequences in the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC 2173 (~ 1.58 Gyr): a well-defined, narrow blue sequence and a sparser red sequence. The extended core region excludes collisional formation as a viable channel for BS formation. Our binary evolution models suggest that non-conservative mass transfer (MT) is essential for shaping the distribution of BS binaries in the CMD. The red sequence primarily comprises BS binaries formed through conservative ongoing MT. In contrast, the blue sequence BS binaries are formed through non-conservative post-MT processes, all involving white dwarf (WD) companions. These BS+WD binary systems may subsequently undergo a second MT phase, leading to the formation of double WD systems.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents the first optical imaging catalogue of resolved Galactic nova remnants. It compiles images from proprietary observations carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope and public archives using different telescopes and instruments. The catalogue includes images spanning from 1950 to 2024 of 66 novae out of the more than 550 novae detected to date. Diffuse emission from a nova shell is detected in 45 sources, with another 16 sources been stellar and five more been barely resolved. We used the catalogue to introduce a main morphological classification of the nova remnants (R - round, E - elliptical, B - bipolar, A - asymmetric, I - irregular, S - stellar, and G - barely resolved) with secondary features (s - smooth, c - clumpy, m - mixed, f - filaments, t - tails, m - multiple shells, e - equatorial brightness enhancement). Resolved nova remnants are mostly round (27%) or elliptical (56%), with very few bipolar or with equatorial brightness enhancement (13%). Most nova remnants are younger than 150 yr, with about 80% of nova remnant detection rate among those younger than 60 yr. The physical size of nova remnants increases with age at a rate of 0.0725 pc per century up to a median value of 0.03 pc. This relationship seems to apply even to the few known ancient nova shells with ages up to a few millennia. The aspect ratio of nova remnants can be described by a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation $\sigma$ of 0.18 from round morphologies (major to minor axes ratio of unity).
#### Search for $γ$-ray emission from SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud: a new cluster analysis at energies above 4 GeV

 - **Abstract**
 A search for $\gamma$-ray emission from SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) based on the detection of concentrations in the arrival direction Fermi-LAT images of photons at energies higher than 10 GeV found significant evidence for 9 of these sources. This analysis was based on data collected in the time window since August 4 2008 to August, 4 2020 (12 years). In the present contribution, we report results of a new search extended using a 15-year long (up to August, 4 2023) data set and to a broad energy range (higher than 4 GeV). The longer baseline and the softer energy lower limit are required to further understand the relation between the X-ray and gamma ray SNRs in the LMC, and to investigate the completness of the sample at low luminosities. Two different methods of clustering analysis were applied: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and the combination of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and DENsity-based CLUstEring (DENCLUE) algorithms. We confirm all previous detections and found positive indications for at least 8 new clusters with a spatial correspondence with other SNRs, increasing thus the number of remnants in LMC candidate or detected in the high energy $\gamma$-rays to 16 sources. This study extends previous analyses of $\gamma$-ray emission from SNRs in the LMC by incorporating a longer observational baseline and a broader energy range. The improved dataset and advanced clustering techniques enhance our understanding of the connection between X-ray and $\gamma$-ray SNRs, providing new insights into their high-energy properties, and contributing to assessing the completeness of the sample at lower luminosities.
#### Small-scale energetic phenomena in Hε: Ellerman bombs, UV bursts, and small flares

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. We investigated the potential of using Hepsilon to diagnose small-scale energetic phenomena such as Ellerman bombs, UV bursts, and small-scale flares. Our focus is to understand the formation of the line and how to use its properties to get insight into the dynamics of small-scale energetic phenomena. Methods. We carried out a forward modeling study, combining simulations and detailed radiative transfer calculations. The 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations were run with the Bifrost code and included energetic phenomena. We employed a Markovian framework to study the Hepsilon multilevel source function, used relative contribution functions to identify its formation regions, and correlated the properties of synthetic spectra with atmospheric parameters. Results. Ellerman bombs are predominantly optically thick in Hepsilon, appearing as well-defined structures. UV bursts and small flares are partially optically thin and give rise to diffuse structures. The Hepsilon line serves as a good velocity diagnostic for small-scale heating events in the lower chromosphere. However, its emission strength is a poor indicator of temperature, and its line width offers limited utility due to the interplay of various broadening mechanisms. Compared to Halpha, Hepsilon exhibits greater sensitivity to phenomena such as Ellerman bombs, as its line core experiences higher extinction than the Halpha wing. Conclusions. Hepsilon is a valuable tool for studying small-scale energetic phenomena in the lower chromosphere. It provides more reliable estimates of velocities than those extracted from wing emission in Halpha or Hbeta. Maps of Hepsilon emission show more abundant energetic events than the Halpha counterpart. Our findings highlight Hepsilons potential to advance our understanding of dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere.
#### The core software and simulation activities for data analysis at the Pierre Auger Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The Pierre Auger Observatory, located near the town Malargüe in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, is the largest cosmic-ray detector in existence, covering an area of 3000 km2. The upgraded Observatory, in Phase II of operations, consists of a surface array of 1660 stations combining water Cherenkov, scintillator, and radio detectors. A subset of stations also includes underground muon detectors. Additionally, fluorescence detectors located at four sites overlook the array. The science goals for the enhanced Observatory include the measurement of the properties of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with large statistics and high sensitivity to the primary composition. The Observatory is also sensitive to photons and neutrinos at the highest energies, allowing it to participate in multi-messenger studies. The Auger Offline Framework provides the tools to perform detailed simulations, using the Geant 4 toolkit, of all components of the Observatory and the analysis of both data and simulated events. It proved to have the flexibility needed to evolve during the lifetime of the Observatory, to accommodate new sub-detectors and, recently, changes to the station readout electronics. A new challenge is interfacing the framework with Machine Learning tools for both the development and execution of neural-network-based algorithms. Independent of the framework, CORSIKA 7 is used to simulate particles, fluorescence light, and radio signals produced by air showers. The production of simulations is coordinated centrally to provide standard libraries for analyses and to optimize the use of computing resources. We will describe the evolution and status of the Offline Framework and the tools used to coordinate the simulation efforts. We will also discuss the challenges of the massive simulation efforts and the resources consumed to provide the simulation libraries required by the Collaboration.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 850 $\mu$m polarized continuum observations carried out with the POL-2 polarimeter mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) towards NGC 7023 located in the Cepheus Flare region. NGC 7023 is a reflection nebula powered by a Herbig Ae Be star HD 200775 and also identified as a hub in the hub-filament cloud, LDN 1172/1174. We detect submillimetre emission well towards the northern (identified as C1) and the eastern region of the reflection nebula. We investigated the polarization structure and the magnetic field (B-field) morphology, which is found to be curved and follows the clump morphology. The comparison of the B-field morphology at the clump scales ($\sim$0.02 pc) with that of the envelope ($\sim$0.5 pc) suggests that the field lines are not preserved from envelope to clump scales, implying that an external factor may be responsible for disturbing the B-field structure. We estimated a magnetic field strength of 179$\pm$50 $\mu$G in the starless core, 121$\pm$34 $\mu$G in the protostellar core with a class I source and 150$\pm$42 $\mu$G in the protostellar core with a class II source using the $N_{2}H^{+}$ (1-0) line observed with 13.7 m single dish radio telescope at Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory (TRAO). The stability analysis using these B-field strengths gives magnetically sub-critical values, while the magnetic, gravitational, and outflow kinetic energies are roughly balanced. We also suggest that the reordering of the magnetic field lines could be due to the interaction with the already evolved high-velocity outflow gas around the central star, which hints at the presence of outflow feedback.
