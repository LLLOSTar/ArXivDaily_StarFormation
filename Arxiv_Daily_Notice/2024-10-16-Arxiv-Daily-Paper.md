 - **Abstract**
 With a temperature of $\sim 285$ K WISE0855 is the coldest brown dwarf observed so far. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we obtained observations that allow us to characterize WISE0855s atmosphere focusing on vertical variation in the water steam abundance, measuring trace gas abundances and receiving bulk parameters for this cold object. We observed the ultra cool dwarf WISE0855 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS) onboard JWST at a spectral resolution of up to 3750. We combined the observation with published data from the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395M and PRISM modes yielding a spectrum ranging from 0.8 to 22 um. We apply atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS to measure atmospheric abundances, the pressure-temperature structure, radius and gravity of the brown dwarf. We also employ publicly available clear and cloudy self-consistent grid models to estimate bulk properties of the atmosphere such as the effective temperature, radius, gravity and metallicity. Atmospheric retrievals constrain a variable water abundance profile in the atmosphere, as predicted by equilibrium chemistry. We detect the 15NH3 isotopologue and infer a ratio of mass fraction of 14NH3/15NH3 = 332+63-43 for the clear retrieval. We measure the bolometric luminosity by integrating the presented spectrum and obtain a value of log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = -7.291+/-0.008. The detected water depletion indicates that water condenses out in the upper atmosphere due to the very low effective temperature of WISE0855. The height in the atmosphere where this occurs is covered by the MIRI/MRS data, and thus demonstrates the potential of MIRI to characterize cold gas giants atmospheres. Comparing the data to retrievals and self-consistent grid models, we do not detect signs for water ice clouds, although their spectral features have been predicted in previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Located 10.888 pc from Earth, COCONUTS-2b is a planetary-mass companion to a young (150--800 Myr) M3 star, with a wide orbital separation (6471 au) and a low companion-to-host mass ratio ($0.021\pm0.005$). We have studied the atmospheric properties of COCONUTS-2b using newly acquired 1.0--2.5~$\mu$m spectroscopy from Gemini/Flamingos-2. The spectral type of COCONUTS-2b is refined to T$9.5 \pm 0.5$ based on comparisons with T/Y dwarf spectral templates. We have conducted an extensive forward-modeling analysis, comparing the near-infrared spectrum and mid-infrared broadband photometry with sixteen state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids developed for brown dwarfs and self-luminous exoplanets near the T/Y transition. The \texttt{PH$_{3}$-free ATMO2020++}, \texttt{ATMO2020++}, and \texttt{Exo-REM} models best match the specific observations of COCONUTS-2b, regardless of variations in the input spectrophotometry. This analysis suggests the presence of disequilibrium chemistry, along with a diabatic thermal structure and/or clouds, in the atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b. All models predict fainter $Y$-band fluxes than observed, highlighting uncertainties in the alkali chemistry models and opacities. We determine a bolometric luminosity of $\log{(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot})}=-6.18$ dex, with a 0.5 dex-wide range of $[-6.43,-5.93]$ dex that accounts for various assumptions of models. Using thermal evolution models, we derive an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=483^{+44}_{-53}$ K, a surface gravity of $\log{(g)}=4.19^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ dex, a radius of $R=1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, and a mass of $M=8 \pm 2$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. Various atmospheric model grids consistently indicate that COCONUTS-2b's atmosphere has sub- or near-solar metallicity and C/O. These findings provide valuable insights into COCONUTS-2b's formation history and the potential outward migration to its current wide orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently discovered Pa 30 nebula, the putative type Iax supernova remnant associated with the historical supernova of 1181 AD, shows puzzling characteristics that make it unique among known supernova remnants. In particular, Pa 30 exhibits a complex morphology, with a unique radial and filamentary structure, and it hosts a hot stellar remnant at its center, which displays oxygen-dominated, ultra-fast winds. Because of the surviving stellar remnant and the lack of hydrogen and helium in its filaments, it has been suggested that Pa 30 is the product of a failed thermonuclear explosion in a near- or super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf, which created a sub-luminous transient, a rare sub-type of the Ia class of supernovae called type Iax. We here present a detailed study of the 3D structure and velocities of a full radial section of the remnant. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations, obtained with the new red channel of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectrograph, reveal that the ejecta are consistent with being ballistic, with velocities close to the free-expansion velocity. Additionally, we detect a large cavity inside the supernova remnant and a sharp inner edge to the filamentary structure, which coincides with the outer edge of a bright ring detected in infrared images. Finally, we detect a strong asymmetry in the amount of ejecta along the line of sight, which might hint to an asymmetric explosion. Our analysis provides strong confirmation that the explosion originated from SN 1181.

 - **Abstract**
 When a hot Jupiter orbits a star whose effective temperature exceeds $\sim$6100 K, its orbit normal tends to be misaligned with the stellar spin axis. Cooler stars have smaller obliquities. The latter may have been damped by hot Jupiters in resonance lock with axisymmetric stellar gravity modes (azimuthal number $m=0$), as has been recently recognized. Here we allow for resonance locks with non-axisymmetric modes, which affect both stellar obliquity and spin frequency. Obliquities damp for all modes ($-2 \leq m \leq 2$). Stars spin up for $m > 0$, and spin down for $m < 0$. We carry out a population synthesis that assumes hot Jupiters form misaligned around both cool and hot stars, and subsequently lock onto modes whose $m$-values yield the highest mode energies for given starting obliquities. Core hydrogen burning enables hot Jupiters to torque low-mass stars, but not high-mass stars, into spin-orbit alignment. Resonance locking plus stellar spin-down from magnetic braking largely reproduces observed obliquities and stellar rotation rates and how they trend with stellar effective temperature and orbital separation.

 - **Abstract**
 We performed a chemical analysis of the asteroid-bearing white dwarf WD 1145+017 using optical and ultraviolet spectroscopic data from 25 epochs between 2015 and 2023. We present an updated gas disk model with improved opacity calculations and temperature profiles to properly account for all circumstellar absorption features. Incorporating these changes into our models, we identified at least 10 elements in the disk, including a detection of circumstellar Na. We detected 16 elements in the photosphere, including new detections of P, Co and Cu. At 16 elements, WD 1145+017 ties GD 362 as one of the most polluted white dwarfs in terms of the number of elements detected. We find that both the disk and photosphere compositions align, to first order, with CI Chondrite. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for circumstellar absorption, as neglecting them leads to significant abundance errors. Additionally, the analysis of the disk's opacity highlighted a ultraviolet flux reduction due to a pseudo-continuum due to a optically thick component. This result may affect previous analyses of other polluted white dwarfs, suggesting a need for revisiting some studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-cadence transient surveys have discovered rapid transients whose light curve timescales are shorter than those of typical supernovae. In this paper, we present a systematic search for rapid transients at medium-high redshifts among 3381 supernova candidates obtained from the Subaru HSC-SSP transient survey. We developed a machine learning classifier to classify the supernova candidates into four types (Type Ia, Ibc, II supernovae, and rapid transients) based on the features derived from the light curves. By applying this classifier to the 3381 supernova candidates and by further applying the quality cut, we selected 14 rapid transient samples. They are located at a wide range of redshifts ($0.34 \leq z \leq 1.85$) and show a wide range of the peak absolute magnitude ($-17 \geq M \geq -22$). The event rate of the rapid transients is estimated to be $\sim 6\times10^3~\rm{events~yr^{-1}~Gpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 0.74$, which corresponds to about $2$ $\%$ of the event rate of normal core-collapse supernovae at the similar redshift. Based on the luminosity and color evolution, we selected two candidates of Type Ibn supernovae at $z\sim0.75$. The event rate of Type Ibn SN candidates is more than 1 $\%$ of Type Ib SN rate at the same redshift, suggesting that this fraction of massive stars at this redshift range eruptively ejects their He-rich envelope just before the explosions. Also, two objects at $z=1.37$ and 1.85 show high luminosities comparable to superluminous supernovae. Their event rate is about 10-25 $\%$ of superluminous supernovae at $z\sim 2$.

 - **Abstract**
 The streaming instability (SI) is currently the leading candidate for triggering planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Recently, a novel variation, the `azimuthal-drift' streaming instability (AdSI), was discovered in disks exhibiting laminar gas accretion. Unlike the classical SI, the AdSI does not require pressure gradients and can concentrate dust even at low abundances. We extend previous simulations of the AdSI to explore the impact of dust abundance, accretion flow strength, pressure gradients, and grain size. For a dimensionless accretion flow strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{M}}=0.1$ and particle Stokes number $\operatorname{St}=0.1$, we find the AdSI produces dust filaments for initial dust-to-gas ratios as low as $\epsilon=0.01$. For $\epsilon\gtrsim 1$, maximum dust-to-gas ratios of order 100 are attained, which can be expected to undergo gravitational collapse. Furthermore, even in systems dominated by the classical SI, an accretion flow drives filament formation, without which the disk remains in a state of small-scale turbulence. Our results suggest that an underlying accretion flow facilitates dust concentration and may thus promote planetesimal formation.
#### The Thermal Emission Spectrum of the Nearby Rocky Exoplanet LTT 1445A b from JWST MIRI/LRS

 - **Abstract**
 The nearby transiting rocky exoplanet LTT 1445A b presents an ideal target for studying atmospheric retention in terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. It is cooler than many rocky exoplanets yet tested for atmospheres, receiving a bolometric instellation similar to Mercury's. Previous transmission spectroscopy ruled out a light H/He-dominated atmosphere but could not distinguish between a bare-rock, a high-MMW, or a cloudy atmosphere. We present new secondary eclipse observations using JWST's MIRI/LRS, covering the 5-12 $\mu$m range. From these observations, we detect a broadband secondary eclipse depth of 41 $\pm$ 9 ppm and measure a mid-eclipse timing consistent with a circular orbit (at 1.7$\sigma$). From its emission spectrum, the planet's dayside brightness temperature is constrained to 525 $\pm$ 15 K, yielding a temperature ratio relative to the maximum average dayside temperature from instant thermal reradiation by a rocky surface $R$ = $T_{\rm day,obs}/T_{\rm max}$ = 0.952 $\pm$ 0.057, consistent with emission from a dark rocky surface. From an energy balance perspective, such a warm dayside temperature disfavors thick atmospheres, excluding $\sim$100 bar atmospheres with Bond albedo $>$ 0.08 at the 3$\sigma$ level. Furthermore, forward modeling of atmospheric emission spectra disfavor simple 100\% CO$_2$ atmospheres with surface pressures of 1, 10, and 100 bar at 4.2$\sigma$, 6.6$\sigma$, and 6.8$\sigma$ confidence, respectively. These results suggest that LTT 1445A b lacks a very thick CO$_2$ atmosphere, possibly due to atmospheric erosion driven by stellar activity. However, the presence of a moderately thin atmosphere (similar to those on Mars, Titan, or Earth) remains uncertain.
#### Direct High-resolution Observation of Feedback and Chemical Enrichment in the Circumgalactic Medium at Redshift 2.8

 - **Abstract**
 Although the circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a vital role in galaxy evolution, studying the emission from CGM is challenging due to its low surface brightness and the complexities involved in interpreting resonant lines like Ly$\alpha$. The near-infrared coverage, unprecedented sensitivity, and high spatial resolution of the JWST enable us to study the optical strong lines associated with the extended Ly$\alpha$ "nebulae" at redshift 2-3. These lines serve as diagnostic tools to infer the physical conditions in the massive CGM gas reservoir of these systems. In deep medium-band images taken by the JWST, we serendipitously discover the [O III] emission from the CGM surrounding a massive interacting galaxy system at redshift z ~ 2.8, known to be embedded in a bright extended (100 kpc) Ly$\alpha$ "nebula". This is the first time that the [O III] lines are detected from a Ly$\alpha$ "nebula", and the JWST images reveal that the CGM gas actually resides in narrow (~ 2.5 kpc) filamentary structures with strong [O III] emission, tracing the same extent as the Ly$\alpha$ emission. Analysis of the [O III] suggests that the emitting CGM is fully ionized and is energetically dominated by mechanical heating. We also find that the inferred density and pressure are higher than those commonly predicted by simulations of the CGM. We conclude that the observed CGM emission originates from the gas expelled by the episodic feedback processes, cooling down and enriching the CGM, while travelling to a distance of at least 60 kpc. These observations demonstrate how fierce feedback processes shape gas distribution and properties in the CGM around massive halos. While the deep high-resolution imaging opens up a new discovery space for investigating the CGM, it also challenges numerical simulations to explain and reproduce the exquisitely complex structures revealed by the observations.
#### Unveiling two deeply embedded young protostars in the S68N Class 0 protostellar core with JWST/NIRSpec

 - **Abstract**
 The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 $\mu$m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.94 $\pm$ 0.15 cm s$^{-2}$. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 $\mu$m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast $C$-type shocks ($\geq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), with high pre-shock density ($\geq$ $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where $B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,\mu\textrm{G}$) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH$^{+}$ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.
#### Sulfur in the Giant Planets, their Moons, and Extrasolar Gas Giant Planets

 - **Abstract**
 We review sulfur chemistry of the gas giant planets and their moons where sulfur compounds are observed. The major S-bearing gas in the upper atmospheres of the giant planets is H2S and is removed from their observable atmospheres by condensation into cloud layers (NH4SH on all four planets and additionally H2S ice on Uranus and Neptune). Any remaining H2S at higher altitudes is destroyed photochemically. Among the moons Io is the world dominated by sulfur. We summarize the sulfur cycle on Io and how pyrovolcanism is spreading sulfur across the Jovian system. Implantation of sulfur into icy surfaces of the other Galilean moons via magnetospheric transfer and radiolysis are major processes affecting the sulfur chemistry on their icy surfaces. On the icy worlds, we are literally looking at the top of the icebergs. Subsurface liquid salty bodies reveal themselves through cryovolcanism on Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, where salt deposits are indicated. Subsurface oceans are suspected on several other moons. We summarize the sulfur cycle for the icy Galilean moons. The occurrence of sulfates can be explained by salt exchange reactions of radiolytically produced H2SO4 with brine salts (carbonates and halides), or from a subsurface ocean that has become acidified by uptake of H2SO4 leaked from ice. In the primordial oceans of the moons that accreted with high ice rock ratios, sulfur is expected as sulfide and bisulfide anions and H2S in aqueous solution. Cosmochemical constraints suggest that pyrrhotite, tochilinite and green rusts could be important sulfide bearing compounds found with hydrous silicates such as serpentine, and magnetite on the sea floors. In N-C-rich worlds such as Titan, sulfides such as NH4SH and possibly thiazyl compounds could be important, and sulfates are unstable. Nothing is known about the sulfur chemistry on the Uranian and Neptunian moons.

 - **Abstract**
 This report summarizes what has happened in the mini-workshops entitled ''My Earth in 180 minutes'' organized during the lunch break at the SF2A 2024 conference in Marseille. The project showcased an innovative serious game designed to raise awareness of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in astronomical research laboratories. Participants, organized into teams, simulate strategies to reduce their carbon footprints by 50\%, focusing on key astronomical activities such as space instrumentation, data analysis, and laboratory work. The sessions highlight the challenges of achieving significant emissions reductions without disrupting core research activities, such as telescope observations. While the serious game facilitates important discussions on sustainable practices, the results point to the need for broader engagement, adaptation to different cultural contexts, and institutional support. The project highlights the importance of integrating climate action into the academic environment and suggests potential future directions for expanding its impact.

 - **Abstract**
 Hot subdwarf (SD) stars are the stripped cores of red giant stars in transition to the white dwarf sequence. The B-type subdwarfs (sdB) are powered by helium fusion in the core, more evolved ones (sdO) by shell burning. Low mass SDs may evolve through this stage without any support by nuclear fusion. Because the loss of the giants' envelopes is likely caused by mass transfer in binaries, hot SDs are test beds for close-binary evolution through stable and unstable Roche lobe overflow, common envelope formation and ejection as well as mergers. Many classes of hot SDs can be identified according to surface composition, binarity, magnetism, pulsation characteristics and population membership, including members of globular clusters. Observed binaries show a wide spread of orbital periods from 20 minutes to more than 1,000 days with white dwarf or main sequence companions. The closest systems qualify as type Ia supernova progenitors and LISA detectable gravitational wave sources. High-precision light curves from Kepler and TESS combined with radial velocity curves are used to derive masses, while asteroseismology adds information on the internal structure, slow rotation, and synchronization. Gaia's parallax measurements now allow us to place the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and derive stellar parameters by combining them with multi-band photometry. The stellar radius can be determined to high precision this way. Newton's law can then be used to derive masses if accurate surface gravities are available. Large-scale spectroscopic surveys will provide atmospheric parameters for large samples of stars, allowing the mass distributions for the diverse subtypes to be established. These are crucial for testing binary synthesis models and constraining poorly known parameters such as the common envelope efficiency as well as the critical threshold mass-ratio for mass transfer stability.
#### ALMA Observations of Proper Motions of the Dust Clumps in the Protoplanetary Disk MWC 758

 - **Abstract**
 To study the dust dynamics in the dust trapping vortices in the protoplanetary disk around MWC~758, we analyzed the 1.3 mm continuum images of the MWC~758 disk obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2017 and 2021. We detect proper motions of 22 mas and 24 mas in the two dust clumps at radii of 0\farcs32 and 0\farcs54 in the disk on the plane of the sky, respectively. On the assumption that the dust clumps are located in the disk midplane, the velocities of the observed proper motions along the azimuthal direction of the inner and outer dust clumps are sub- and super-Keplerian, respectively, and both have angular velocities corresponding to the Keplerian angular velocity at a radius of $0\farcs46\pm0\farcs04$. This deviation from the Keplerian motion is not expected in the conventional theory of vortices formed by the Rossby wave instability. The observed non-Keplerian proper motions of the dust clumps are unlikely due to the disk warp and eccentricity, nor be associated with any predicted planets. The two dust clumps are likely spatially coincident with the infrared spirals. In addition, we detect the changes in the intensity profiles of the dust clumps over the four-year span. Therefore, we suggest that the observed proper motions are possibly due to changes in the density distributions in the dust clumps caused by their interaction with the spirals in the disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Scylla is a deep Hubble Space Telescope survey of the stellar populations, interstellar medium and star formation in the LMC and SMC. As a pure-parallel complement to the Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) survey, Scylla obtained 342 orbits of ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (IR) imaging of the LMC and SMC with Wide Field Camera 3. In this paper, we describe the science objectives, observing strategy, data reduction procedure, and initial results from our photometric analysis of 96 observed fields. Although our observations were constrained by ULYSSES primary exposures, we imaged all fields in at least two filters (F475W and F814W), and 64% of fields in at least three and as many as seven WFC3 filters spanning the UV to IR. Overall, we reach average 50% completeness of $m_{\rm F225W}=26.0$, $m_{\rm F275W}=26.2$, $m_{\rm F336W}=26.9$, $m_{\rm F475W}=27.8$, $m_{\rm F814W}=25.5$, $m_{\rm F110W}=24.7$, and $m_{\rm F160W}=24.0$ Vega magnitudes in our photometric catalogs, which is faintward of the ancient main sequence turnoff in all filters. The primary science goals of Scylla include characterizing the structure and properties of dust in the MCs, as well as their spatially-resolved star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Our images and photometric catalogs, which represent the widest-area coverage of MCs with HST photometry to date, are available as a high-level science product at the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the properties of a population of cool clouds in simulated galaxy outflows. Using data from the CGOLS isolated galaxy simulations, we generate catalogues of $\sim 10^5$ clouds. We describe the impact of two different supernova feedback models -- a centrally concentrated starburst and disk-wide distributed star formation -- on the resulting cloud population. In both cases we find that the mass distribution function $dN/dM \propto M^{-2}$, in good agreement with model predictions of turbulent fragmentation. We explore how cloud properties change with distance from the galaxy and find no qualitative distinction between the two feedback modes, although significant quantitative differences exist in attributes such as the total number of clouds, their densities, etc. We further show that both internal cloud velocities and cloud-cloud relative velocities are described well by properties of turbulent motion, despite significant bulk radial velocities. Finally, we investigate the distribution of cloud sizes in the context of recent theoretical arguments about cloud survival in winds. We find that proposed cloud survival criteria are a good predictor of cloud survival, in both the case where clouds are primarily destroyed and the case where cloud growth occurs in the outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary population synthesis (BPS) is an essential tool for extracting information about massive binary evolution from gravitational-wave (GW) detections of compact object mergers. It has been successfully used to constrain the most likely permutations of evolution models among hundreds of alternatives, while initial condition models, in contrast, have not yet received the same level of attention. Here, we introduce BOSSA, a detailed initial sampling code including a set of 192 initial condition permutations for BPS that capture both "invariant" and "varying" models, the latter accounting for a possible metallicity- and star formation rate (SFR)-dependence of the initial mass function (IMF); as well as correlations between the initial primary mass, orbital period, mass ratio and eccentricity of binaries. We include 24 metallicity-specific cosmic star formation history (cSFH) models and propose two alternate models for the mass-dependent binary fraction. We build a detailed pipeline for time-evolving BPS, such that each binary has well-defined initial conditions, and we are able to distinguish the contributions from populations of different ages. We discuss the meaning of the IMF for binaries and introduce a refined initial sampling procedure for component masses. We also discuss the treatment of higher-order multiple systems when normalizing a binary sample. In particular, we argue for how a consistent interpretation of the IMF implies that this is not the distribution from which any set of component masses should be independently drawn, and show how the individual IMF of primaries and companions is expected to deviate from the full IMF.
