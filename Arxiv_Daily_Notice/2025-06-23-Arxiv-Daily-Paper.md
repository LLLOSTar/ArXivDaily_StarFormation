#### Super-Eddington Growth Ceiling: Analytic Constraints on the Rapid Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Massive Clumps
 - **Authors:** Masaki Kiyuna

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15781

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of $\sim10^{7-8}{\rm M}_\odot$ supermassive black holes at $z\gtrsim 8$ challenges conventional growth channels. One attractive possibility is that light seeds ($M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$) undergo short, super-Eddington episodes when they cross, and are captured by, dense massive gas clumps. We revisit this ``BH-clump-capture'' model using analytic arguments supported by toy-model simulations that follow Bondi-scale inflow, radiative feedback, gas dynamical friction and the recently discovered forward acceleration effect caused by the ionised bubble. For substantial growth the black hole must remain trapped for many dynamical times, which imposes three simultaneous constraints. The clump must be heavier than the black hole (mass doubling condition); its cooling time must exceed the super-Eddington growth time (lifetime condition); and dynamical friction must dominate shell acceleration (BH-trapping condition). These requirements confine viable clumps to a narrow density-temperature region, $n_{\rm H}\simeq10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $T\simeq(2-6)\times10^{3}{\rm K}$, for a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed. Even inside this sweet spot a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed grow up at most $4\times10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$; the maximum growth ratio $M_{\rm BH, fin}/M_{\rm BH}$ falls approximately as $M_{\rm BH}^{-0.4}$ and is negligible once $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$. The forward-acceleration effect is essential, expelling the black hole whenever photon trapping fails. We conclude that BH-clump-capture model, and potentially broad super-Eddington models, cannot produce the $>10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$ seeds required for subsequent Eddington-limited growth, suggesting that alternative pathways, such as heavy seed formation, remain necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on large-scale radio observations of the Chamaeleon star-forming region obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) that led to the definite detection of five young stars and the tentative detection of five more. As in other regions surveyed in the radio domain, the majority of detected sources are fairly evolved low-mass T Tauri stars, but we also detect one protostellar object (Ced 110 IRS4) and one Herbig Ae/Be star. With the exception of the protostellar source, the radio emission mechanism is likely of non-thermal origin. The three brightest radio stars identified with ATCA were subsequently observed with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and one, J11061540-7721567 (Ced 110 IRS2), was detected at three epochs. This confirms the non-thermal nature of the radio emission in that specific case, and enabled accurate radio position measurements. Comparison with predictions from Gaia DR3 strongly suggests that this star is a binary system with an orbital period of order 40 years; additional LBA observations in the next decades would enable accurate determinations of the individual stellar masses in that system.
#### The Modeling Landscape of Extragalactic CO in CMB Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) line emission will likely be an important signal in current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys on small scales. However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO emission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB surveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we generate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the broadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power spectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150, and 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to two orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be detectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will be a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on CMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum analysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on CMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times greater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we assess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\times$CIB spectra we obtain is captured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component analysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like survey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to account for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB experiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.
#### A Massive Yellow Supergiant in the Far Outer Disk of M31: Evidence for In Situ Massive Star Formation Beyond the Optical Radius

 - **Abstract**
 While massive stars are known to shape galactic ecosystems, their formation has long been assumed to require the high-density environments of inner galactic disks. This paradigm is challenged by mounting evidence of young massive stars in extended galaxy outskirts, yet direct confirmation of in situ massive star formation in such extreme low-density environments remains scarce. Here, we present the discovery of LAMOST J0048+4154, a massive yellow supergiant situated at a deprojected galactocentric distance of ~34 kpc in M31, making it the most distant massive star confirmed in this galaxy. Through spectroscopic and photometric analyses, we classify J0048+4154 as an F5-F8I supergiant with an effective temperature of $6357^{+121}_{-118}$ K and a luminosity of $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to an ~18 $M_{\odot}$ progenitor and an age of ~10 Myr. FAST H I observations reveal close spatial and kinematic alignment between the star and a faint H I external arm, suggesting in situ formation in a region of low gas density. The presence of other UV-bright, early-type stars in the vicinity further supports low-level recent star formation in M31's very outer disk. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that massive star formation is confined to inner disks or classical star-forming regions and underscore the need to re-examine the role of spiral galaxy outskirts in fueling and sustaining star formation. J0048+4154 thereby expands our understanding of the extent of M31's young stellar component and exemplifies how outer disks may harbor conditions conducive to forming massive stars, despite low-density environments.
#### Osiris revisited: Confirming a solar metallicity and low C/O in HD 209458b

 - **Abstract**
 HD 209458b is the prototypical hot Jupiter and one of the best targets available for precise atmosphere characterisation. Now that spectra from both Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are available, we can reveal the atmospheric properties in unprecedented detail. In this study, we perform a new data reduction and analysis of the original HST/WFC3 spectrum, accounting for the wavelength dependence of the instrument systematics that was not considered in previous analyses. This allows us to precisely and robustly measure the much-debated H$_2$O abundance in HD 209458b's atmosphere. We combine the newly reduced spectrum with archival JWST/NIRCam data and run free chemistry atmospheric retrievals over the 1.0 - 5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, covering possible features of multiple absorbing species, including CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, HCN, Na, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We detect H$_2$O and CO$_2$ robustly at above 7 $\sigma$ significance, and find a 3.6 $\sigma$ preference for cloudy models compared to a clear atmosphere. For all other absorbers we tested, only upper limits of abundance can be measured. We use Bayesian model averaging to account for a range of different assumptions about the cloud properties, resulting in a water volume mixing ratio of $0.95^{+0.35}_{-0.17} \:\times$ solar and a carbon dioxide abundance of $0.94^{+0.16}_{-0.09} \:\times$ solar. Both results are consistent with solar values and comparable to predictions from the VULCAN 1D photochemistry model. Combining these values with a prior on the CO abundance from ground-based measurements, we derive an overall atmospheric composition comparable to solar metallicity of $\mathrm{[M/H]} = 0.10^{+0.41}_{-0.40}$ and very low C/O of $0.054^{+0.080}_{-0.034}$ with a 3 $\sigma$ upper limit of 0.454. This indicates a strong enrichment in oxygen and depletion in carbon during HD 209458b's formation.
#### Cosmic-ray and Interstellar Gas Properties in the Solar Neighborhood Revealed by Diffuse Gamma Rays

 - **Abstract**
 To investigate the interstellar medium (ISM) and Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the solar neighborhood, we analyzed ${\gamma}$-ray data by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) for five nearby molecular cloud regions. Our data includes the MBM/Pegasus region (MBM~53, 54, 55 clouds and Pegasus loop), R CrA region (R Coronae Australis clouds), Chamaeleon region (Chamaeleon clouds), Cep/Pol region (Cepheus and Polaris flare), and Orion region (Orion clouds). The ISM templates are constructed by a component decomposition of the 21~cm {\HI} line, the Planck dust emission model, and the carbon monoxide (CO) 2.6~mm line. Through $\gamma$-ray data analysis the ISM gas is successfully decomposed into non-local {\HI}, narrow-line and optically thick {\HI}, broad-line and optically thin {\HI}, CO-bright {\Htwo}, and CO-dark {\Htwo} for all five regions. CR intensities evaluated by the ${\gamma}$-ray emissivity of broad {\HI} agree well with a model based on directly-measured CR spectra at the Earth, with a gradient giving a higher CR intensity toward the inner Galaxy at the 10\% level in ${\sim}$ 500~pc. The ratio of CO-dark {\Htwo} to CO-bright {\Htwo} anti-correlates with the {\Htwo} mass traced by the CO 2.6~mm line, and reaches 5--10 for small systems of ${\sim}$1000 solar mass.
#### Disentangling Metallicity Effects in Hot Jupiter Occurrence Across Galactic Birth Radius and Phase-Space Density

 - **Abstract**
 We explore how the correlation between host star metallicity and giant planets shapes hot Jupiter occurrence as a function of Galactic birth radius (\rbirth) and phase-space density in the Milky Way disk. Using the GALAH and APOGEE surveys and a galaxy from the NIHAO simulation suite, we inject hot Jupiters around stars based on metallicity power laws, reflecting the trend that giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. For \rbirth\ $\geq 5$ kpc, hot Jupiter occurrence decreases with \rbirth\ by $\sim -0.1%$ per kpc; this is driven by the Galaxy's chemical evolution, where the inner regions of the disk are more metal-rich. Differences in GALAH occurrence rates versus APOGEE's and the simulation's at \rbirth\ $< 5$ kpc arise from survey selection effects. APOGEE and the NIHAO simulation have more high-$\alpha$ sequence stars than GALAH, resulting in average differences in metallicity (0.2--0.4 dex), $\alpha$-process element enrichment (0.2 dex), and vertical velocities (7--14 km/s) at each \rbirth\ bin. Additionally, we replicate the result of \cite{Winter20}, which showed that over 92% of hot Jupiters are associated with stars in phase-space overdensities, or "clustered environments." However, our findings suggest that this clustering effect is primarily driven by chemical and kinematic differences between low and high-$\alpha$ sequence star properties. Our results support stellar characteristics, particularly metallicity, being the primary drivers of hot Jupiter formation, which serves as the "null hypothesis" for interpreting planet demographics. This underscores the need to disentangle planetary and stellar properties from Galactic-scale effects in future planet demographics studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500 pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence, red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au. A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of 1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios follow a power-law distribution with slope -1.4; (f) tertiary orbits are consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities, subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations. Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim 0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We use global MHD galaxy simulations to investigate the effects of spiral arms on the evolution of magnetic fields and star formation within a self-regulated interstellar medium (ISM). The same galaxy is simulated twice: once with self-consistent stellar spiral arms and once more with the stellar spirals suppressed via a novel numerical approach, using the Ramses AMR code. Spiral arms continually promote star formation, with 2.6 times higher rates in the spiral galaxy. The higher rate is due to high gas columns gathered along the spiral arms, rather than increasing the star formation efficiency at a given gas column. In both cases, the magnetic field is initially amplified via a small-scale dynamo driven by turbulence due to supernova feedback. Only the spiral galaxy exhibits late-time, consistent field growth due to a large-scale dynamo (e-folding time $\sim600$ Myr). This results in volume-averaged field strengths of $\sim 1$ $\mu$G after 1 Gyr of evolution. The mean-fields tend to align themselves with the spiral arms and are coherent up to 10 kpc scales. We demonstrate a novel large-scale dynamo mechanism, whereby spiral-driven radial flows enable the mean-field amplification.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological data and astrophysical observations, such as the Hubble tension and the increasing preference from galaxy surveys for dynamical dark energy, have begun to challenge the standard $\Lambda$-cold dark matter cosmological model. Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) offer a mechanism to alleviate these tensions within the framework of the standard model. These fields source excess small-scale baryon clumping, which can speed up recombination and shrink the comoving sound horizon at the surface of last scattering. Computing the modified recombination history requires coupling the radiative transport of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons to compressible magnetohydronamic simulations. Since doing so is generically computationally intractable, we have developed a linearized treatment which self-consistently computes the modified recombination history in the presence of PMF induced baryon clumping for fields with red-tilted spectra. The clumping factors we find are too small to alleviate outstanding cosmological tensions, but our general framework can be applied to other PMF spectra, and provides a significant theoretical step towards a complete account of recombination in the presence of small-scale baryon clumping.
#### Three-component Phase Separation for Ultramassive White Dwarf Models

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate phase separation in oxygen-neon (O/Ne) ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs). Current stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, only account for $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ separation and do not include other minor species. To improve this, we implement ternary phase diagrams into MESA. We construct UMWD models with O/Ne/sodium (Na) and O/Ne/magnesium (Mg) cores to test our implementation. We also assess the effect of including $\mathrm{^{22}Ne}$ in the current two-species framework. Our results show that incorporating additional components into the phase separation significantly alters the chemical evolution of UMWDs. Heavier elements preferentially enrich the solid core, enhancing mixing in the overlying liquid. We compute the buoyancy flux driven by compositional instabilities during crystallization. As in previous studies, we find two convective regimes: an early, fast overturning convection, lasting less than a million years, followed by inefficient (thermohaline) convection. The fast convective regime lasts up to 100 times longer with three-species separation compared to the standard $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ case. We find that neutron-rich species can have a significant contribution to the buoyancy flux despite their small mass fraction (<10\%). We compute the amount of cooling delay induced by phase separation in UMWDs, and find that the three-species phase separation produces a delay up to $\sim10$ times larger than the simplest case of fractionation, although still less than 1 Gyr. We predict that the change in the composition profile in the liquid region when three components are included should change the frequency of gravity modes that can propagate in the interior of pulsating UMWDs.
#### Realistic consecutive galaxy mergers form eccentric PTA sources

 - **Abstract**
 Results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs). The observed spectrum shows a flattening at lower frequencies that can be explained by a population of eccentric BHBs. This study aims to determine the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of the most massive BHBs, which are potential sources of the GWB. We select successive galactic major mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation and re-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin, down to binary separations of the order of a parsec. Coalescence timescales are estimated using a semi-analytical model that incorporates gravitational wave emission and stellar hardening. Throughout our investigation, we consider the impact of prior mergers on the remnant galaxy in the form of core scouring and anisotropy, which can influence the subsequent formation and evolution of BHBs. We find that all the binaries in our sample enter the PTA band with an eccentricity e>0.85: such a large eccentricity can impact the shape of the PTA observed GWB spectrum, and it highlights the importance of including the eccentricity of binaries when interpreting the PTA signal. Furthermore, we find that: (i) starting from initial separations of a few tens of kpcs, the dynamical friction phase lasts for a few hundred Myrs; (ii) the binary formation time is not resolution dependent; (iii) the scatter on the eccentricity at binary formation decreases with increasing resolution; (iv) triple systems form whenever a third galaxy interacts with a binary which hasn't yet reached coalescence.

 - **Abstract**
 The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources. Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias. Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits. Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation, performance, and generalization of the model.
#### High-resolution APEX/LAsMA $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (3-2) observation of the G333 giant molecular cloud complex : III. Decomposition of molecular clouds into multi-scale hub-filament structures

 - **Abstract**
 We decomposed the G333 complex and the G331 giant molecular cloud into multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO (3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios. Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in our previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 The analysis of biorelevant molecules in returned mission samples such as from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu is key to unravelling the role of extraterrestrial organics in the evolution of life. Coordinated analyses using minimally destructive techniques at the finest length-scales on pristine samples are particularly important. Here, we identify the chemical signature of unique globular and nitrogen-containing diffuse organic matter in asteroid Ryugu and map the distribution of these biorelevant molecules with unprecedented detail. Using a novel electron-microscopy-based combination of vibrational and core-level spectroscopy, we disentangle the chemistry and nanoscale petrography of these organics. We show that some of these organics contain soluble and highly aliphatic components as well as NHx functional groups, that must have formed in outer solar nebula environments before parent body incorporation. These novel coordinated analyses will open up new avenues of research on these types of precious and rare asteroidal dust samples.
#### The first phase of mass transfer in low-mass binaries: neither stable nor a common envelope

 - **Abstract**
 The masses of the white dwarfs in a binary carry information about previous mass-transfer phases. The core mass -- radius relation of low-mass giants gives the size of the progenitor of a helium white dwarf at the moment it last filled its Roche lobe. Previously, we used this information for a few observed systems to propose a new mass-transfer type, based on an angular momentum balance. Our aim is to investigate if stable mass transfer instead of the angular momentum prescription is consistent with the observed double helium white dwarf masses. We reconstruct the progenitor evolution of observed double helium white dwarfs using the core mass -- radius relation and evaluate if the periods at the start of the second phases of mass transfer are consistent with the outcome of stable mass transfer. More generally, we calculate the mass distribution of double helium white dwarfs for three different progenitors scenarios: double common envelope (with parameter $\alpha \lambda$), angular momentum prescription (with parameter $\gamma$) and stable mass transfer. We find that the observed systems are generally not consistent with stable mass transfer. Stable mass transfer leads to a tight correlation between the two white dwarf masses in a binary that is not consistent with the observed mass distribution. Double common envelope evolution is a particularly poor fit to the observations. The angular momentum prescription can populate the observed mass distribution, but not perfectly. We conclude that the first phase of mass transfer initiated on the red giant branch in low-mass systems does not generally proceed as stable mass transfer nor as common envelope, and thus is poorly understood. This may be related to the fact that for many observed binaries that have finished the first phase of mass transfer the orbit is eccentric, which is an unexpected outcome of mass transfer.
#### On the evolution of the mass density profile of dense molecular clouds

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to obtain the equations which govern the evolution of the mass density profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is $\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow) or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally, under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with $\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.

 - **Abstract**
 Interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks by VLTI and ALMA have greatly improved our understanding of the detailed structure of these planetary birthplaces. These observations have revealed a variety of large-scale disk substructures, including rings, gaps, and spirals, spanning tens to hundreds of au, supporting the predictions of planet formation models. Recent instruments, such as MATISSE at the VLTI, allow one to resolve and investigate the inner few au of protoplanetary disks in nearby star formation regions, shedding light on the traces of planet formation and evolution at these small scales. The aim of this work is to assess the feasibility of interferometric observations of small-scale planet-induced substructures in protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions. We aim to characterize these substructures in multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations and subsequently differentiate between simulation parameters. On the basis of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of embedded planetary companions and subsequent 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we calculated and analyzed interferometric observables, assuming observations with the VLTI in the K, L, M, and N bands. The hydrodynamic simulations exhibit mass-dependent planet-induced density waves that create observable substructures, most notably for the considered case of a 300 $M_{\oplus}$ planet. These substructures share similarities with observed large-scale structures and feature a prominent accretion region around the embedded planet. The visibilities show a detectable variability for multi-epoch VLTI/GRAVITY and VLTI/MATISSE observations, caused by the orbital motion of the planet, that are distinguishable from other sources of variability due to their unique combination of timescale and amplitude.
