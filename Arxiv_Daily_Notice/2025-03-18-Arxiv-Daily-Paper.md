 - **Abstract**
 Blast wave models are commonly used to model relativistic outflows from ultra-relativistic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but are also applied to lower Lorentz factor ejections from X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we revisit the physics of blast waves and reverse shocks in these systems and explore the similarities and differences between the ultra-relativistic ($\Gamma \gg 1$) and moderately relativistic ($\Gamma \sim$ a few) regimes. We first demonstrate that the evolution of the blast wave radius as a function of the observer frame time is recovered in the on-axis ultra-relativistic limit from a general energy and radius blast wave evolution, emphasizing that XRB ejections are off-axis, moderately relativistic cousins of GRB afterglows. We show that, for fixed blast wave or ejecta energy, reverse shocks cross the ejecta much later (earlier) on in the evolution for less (more) relativistic systems, and find that reverse shocks are much longer-lived in XRBs and off-axis GRBs compared to on-axis GRBs. Reverse shock crossing should thus typically finish after $\sim10-100$ days (in the observer frame) in XRB ejections. This characteristic, together with their moderate Lorentz factors and resolvable core separations, makes XRB ejections unique laboratories for shock and particle acceleration physics. We discuss the impact of geometry and lateral spreading on our results, explore how to distinguish between different shock components, and comment on the implications for GRB and XRB environments. Additionally, we argue that identification of reverse shock signatures in XRBs could provide an independent constraint on the ejecta Lorentz factor.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries in outburst launch discrete, large-scale jet ejections which can propagate to parsec scales. The kinematics of these ejecta appear to be well described by relativistic blast wave models original devised for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In previous kinematic-only modelling, a crucial degeneracy prevented the initial ejecta energy and the interstellar medium density from being accurately determined. In this work, we present the first joint Bayesian modelling of the radiation and kinematics of a large-scale jet ejection from the X-ray binary MAXI J1535-571. We demonstrate that a reverse shock powers the bright, early ejecta emission. The joint model breaks the energetic degeneracy, and we find a conservative initial ejecta energy of $E_{0} \sim 4 \times 10^{43} \, {\rm erg}$, consistent with the disc luminosity integrated over a flare-informed launching timescale, and a low interstellar medium density of $n_{\rm ism} \sim 5 \times 10^{-5} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$. This work lays the foundation for future parameter estimation studies using all available data of X-ray binary jet ejecta.

 - **Abstract**
 In the cosmic web, filaments play a crucial role in connecting walls to clusters and also act as an important stage for galaxy formation and evolution. Recent observational studies claim that filaments have spin. In this study, we examined the potential impact of diversity in filament identification algorithms and galaxy survey datasets on the quantification of filament spin. The results of this study demonstrate qualitative agreement with previous research, suggesting that a reliable filament spin signal is detectable when the viewing angle of filament spine larger than 80 degrees under a rough estimation. The detected filament spin signal is intricately linked to the viewing angle, dynamic temperature, etc. The quantitative difference of filament spin signal among samples is slightly dependent on the filament identification algorithms, while the value is relatively greater dependent on the redshift space distortion effect in the galaxy sample.
#### Thermodynamics of self-gravitating fermions as a robust theory for dark matter halos: Stability analysis applied to the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework for dark matter (DM) halo formation based on a kinetic theory of self-gravitating fermions together with a solid connection to thermodynamics. Based on maximum entropy arguments, this approach predicts a most likely phase-space distribution which takes into account the Pauli exclusion principle, relativistic effects, and particle evaporation. The most general equilibrium configurations depend on the particle mass and develop a degenerate compact core embedded in a diluted halo, both linked by their fermionic nature. By applying such a theory to the Milky Way we analyze the stability of different families of equilibrium solutions with implications on the DM distribution and the mass of the DM candidate. We find that stable core-halo profiles, which explain the DM distribution in the Galaxy, exist only in the range $mc^2 \approx 194 - 387\,\rm{keV}$. The lower bound is a consequence of imposing thermodynamical stability on the core-halo solutions having a $4.2\times 10^6 M_\odot$ quantum core mass alternative to the black hole hypothesis at the Galaxy center. The upper bound is solely an outcome of general relativity when the quantum core reaches the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit and undergoes gravitational collapse towards a black hole. We demonstrate that there exists a set of stable core-halo profiles which are astrophysically relevant in the sense that their total mass is finite, do not suffer from the gravothermal catastrophe, and agree with observations. The morphology of the outer halo tail is described by a polytrope of index $5/2$, developing a sharp decline of the density beyond $25\,\rm{kpc}$ in excellent agreement with the latest Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. Moreover, we obtain a total mass of about $2\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ including baryons and a local DM density of about $0.4\,\rm{GeV}\,c^{-2}\,\rm{cm}^{-3}$ in line with recent independent estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Dust concentration in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is the first step towards planetesimal formation, a crucial yet highly uncertain stage in planet formation. Although the streaming instability (SI) is widely recognized as a powerful mechanism for planetesimal formation, its properties can be sensitive to the gas dynamical environment. The outer region of PPDs is subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), which could further induce the Rossby wave instability (RWI) to generate numerous vortices. In this work, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to perform a 3D global simulation with mesh refinement to achieve adequate domain size and resolution to resolve and accommodate all these instabilities. The VSI mainly governs the overall gas dynamics, dominated by the breathing mode due to dust mass loading. The dust strongly settles to the midplane layer, which is much more densely populated with small vortices compared to the dust-free case. Strong dust clumping is observed, which is likely owing to the joint action of the SI and dusty RWI, and those sufficient for planetesimal formation reside only in a small fraction of such vortices. Dust clumping becomes stronger with increasing resolution, and has not yet achieved numerical convergence in our exploration. In addition, we find evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) operating at certain parts of the dust-gas interface, which may contribute to the temporary destruction of dust clumps.

 - **Abstract**
 Radiative transfer effects need to be taken into account when analysing spectral line observations. When the data are not sufficient for detailed modelling, simpler methods are needed. The escape probability formalism (EPF) is one such tool. We wish to quantify the model errors in the EPF analysis of interstellar clouds and cores. We introduce PEP, a parallel program for calculating fast EPF parameters quickly. We model full radiative transfer to generate synthetic observations for various cloud models. These are examined with the PEP program, and their results are compared to the actual beam-averaged kinetic temperatures, column densities, and volume densities. PEP enables the calculations of even millions of parameter combinations in a matter of seconds. However, the simple assumptions of EPF can lead to significant errors. In the tests the errors were typically within a factor of two, but could in some cases reach an order of magnitude. The model errors are thus similar or even larger than the statistical errors caused by the typical observational noise. Due to degeneracies, parameter combinations are better constrained than the individual parameters. The model errors could be reduced by using full radiative transfer modelling. However, in the absence of full knowledge of the source structure, the errors are difficult to quantify. We also present a method for approximate handling of hyperfine structure lines in EPF calculations. Both the observational statistical errors and the model errors need to be considered when estimating the reliability of EPF results. Full radiative transfer modelling is needed to better understand the true uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 Aims. Asteroseismic radius and Gaia distance (ARD) method has been proposed to establish the SBCRs for late-type stars. Methods. We select Kepler RGB stars with high-precision asteroseismic radii (uncertainties < 1%) and cross-match them with 2MASS, APASS, and Gaia to obtain Johnson-B, Johnson-V, G, J, H, and Ks-band photometric data. After applying selection criteria, we obtain 626 RGB stars to build the SBCR. Among these, 100 RGBs are used as independent validation for the distance, and the remaining samples are used to fit the SBCR. Results. First, using 526 targets with asteroseismic radii and Gaia distances, nine SBCRs are proposed based on 2MASS (J, H, Ks), APASS (Johnson-B, Johnson-V), and Gaia (G) photometry. The average rms scatter in these relations is 0.075 mag, which corresponds to an uncertainty of approximately 3.5% in distance. These relations are further validated using 100 independent samples with Gaia distances, showing no bias, with a dispersion of approximately 3%. Compared to interferometric measurements, a systematic underestimation of 2.3% was observed, and the discrepancy decreases as the angular diameter increases. Additionally, the distances of eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using our SBCRs are generally consistent with those measured in the literature, with a dispersion of 1% and a slight overestimation of 1% to 2.5%. Conclusions. The ARD method capitalizes on two key advantages for precise stellar distance determination: a statistically robust sample of homogeneous RGB stars with low observational costs, and independent distance verification through Gaia data. Such SBCRs can be further calibrated and expanded more efficiently and effectively.

 - **Abstract**
 This document presents a novel method for the intra-field calibration and imaging of the radio source SgrA$^*$, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SgrA$^*$ is a complex source comprising two components: the compact core (which exhibits high variability) and the extended minispiral (which is relatively stable over short timescales). The novel approach consists in a self-calibration method that employs the extended structure of the source (the minispiral) to calibrate the flux variability of the compact core. The algorithm involves several steps: (1) an initial CLEAN image is generated for the entire source; (2) the core is subtracted, leaving only the minispiral; (3) a two-component visibility model is constructed, comprising the minispiral and the core; (4) the model is fitted to the data, retrieving flux density parameters for each integration time; and (5) the data are scaled and calibrated, resulting in nearly constant brightness for the minispiral and variable flux for the core. The implementation of this algorithm through a script in the CASA package is described, detailing the configuration parameters and the steps involved. The success of the method is demonstrated through light curves of SgrA$^*$ observed on day 21 April 2018 in Band 6, as part of the 2018 EHT campaign. The light curves have been produced for Stokes I (total intensity), linear polarized intensity, EVPA (electric vector position angle), and Stokes V (circular polarization), providing valuable insights into the variability of this radio source.

 - **Abstract**
 The optical depth to reionization, a key parameter of the $\Lambda$CDM model, can be computed within astrophysical frameworks for star formation by modeling the evolution of the intergalactic medium. Accurate evaluation of this parameter is thus crucial for joint statistical analyses of CMB data and late-time probes such as the 21 cm power spectrum, requiring consistent integration into cosmological solvers. However, modeling the optical depth with sufficient precision in a computationally feasible manner for MCMC analyses is challenging due to the complexities of the nonlinear astrophysics. We introduce NNERO (Neural Network Emulator for Reionization and Optical depth), a framework that leverages neural networks to emulate the evolution of the free-electron fraction during cosmic dawn and reionization. We demonstrate its effectiveness by simultaneously constraining cosmological and astrophysical parameters in both standard cold dark matter and non-cold dark matter scenarios, including models with massive neutrinos and warm dark matter, showcasing its potential for efficient and accurate parameter inference.

 - **Abstract**
 The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Center (GC) region of the Milky Way contains a substantial fraction of the molecular mass of the Galaxy >10e7 solar masses yet exhibits an order of magnitude lower star formation efficiency (SFE) than expected given the high densities found in this region. There are multiple possible explanations for the depressed SFE in the CMZ, like feedback, strong turbulence, longer free-fall timescales, and high magnetic field strengths. It is currently unclear which of these mechanisms is the dominant inhibitor of star formation in the CMZ. It is important to understand the star formation process in the extreme environment of the CMZ because it is the only Galactic nuclear region we are able to study at high spatial resolutions with current observatories. One way to determine the relative importance of the different SFE inhibiting mechanisms is through multi-spatial and multi-frequency polarimetric observations of the CMZ. Such observations will provide insight into the behavior of the magnetic field in this unique environment. These observations will complement radio observations of non-thermal structures revealing the magnetic field morphology and polarization. The PRobe far--Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be uniquely capable of contributing to such explorations by providing unique resolutions and frequencies for polarimetric observations. The PRIMAger instrument will yield polarimetric observations covering the wavelength range 80 -- 261 um with beam sizes ranging from 11 -- 28'', capabilities that complement existing and upcoming observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical masers are widely used in star formation studies. In particular, they are valuable in investigations of high-mass star-forming regions that are difficult to observe at optical frequencies. We used multi-transition data to derive physical conditions in the immediate environment of forming high-mass stars. Simultaneous observations of two maser transitions, excited OH at 6.035 GHz and methanol at 6.668 GHz, were made using e-Merlin. Both transitions are radiatively pumped but prefer diverse physical conditions. We imaged ten high-mass star-forming sites with milliarcsecond angular resolution, identifying regions where excited OH and methanol masers coexist and where they avoid each other. Moreover, we identified circularly polarized Zeeman splitting pairs of the OH transition, estimating magnetic field strengths in the range from 0.2 to 10.6~mG. The detection of linearly polarized components enabled us to compare the directions of magnetic field vectors with the outflows coming from the young star-forming objects. We found that the two maser lines appeared to coexist in six high-mass star-forming regions, in cloudlets separated by up to 205~au. Where the lines show avoidance, this can be related to changes in dust and gas temperatures; we also found a few examples suggestive of a high gas density. In seven sources, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests show the nonrandom relationship between the position angles of distribution of the two maser transitions. We did not obtain consistent results regarding the direction of the magnetic field and outflow.
#### Oscillations of red giant stars with magnetic damping in the core. I. Dissipation of mode energy in dipole-like magnetic fields

 - **Abstract**
 Strong magnetic fields in the core of red-giant branch stars are expected to suppress the amplitudes of the multipole modes. This occurs when the strength of the internal magnetic field approaches the critical field strength, at which the magnetic forces become comparable to the buoyancy. We performed Hamiltonian ray tracing simulations of magneto-gravity waves to investigate the suppression of the multipole modes in the presence of an internal dipole-like magnetic field. We took into account different stellar masses, metallicities, and ages, as well as various oscillation frequencies and spherical degrees. In particular, we estimated the trapped fraction, a measure of multipole mode suppression, which quantifies the fraction of mode energy in the core that is dissipated by the interaction with the magnetic field. Our results indicate that the trapped fraction can be described by a simple expression, which smoothly connects the regime without multipole mode suppression with the regime with complete suppression of the multipole modes. Crucially, the trapped fraction depends only on the ratio between the strength of the internal magnetic field and the critical field strength. Therefore, our expression for the trapped fraction provides a flexible tool that can be used, for example, to estimate the amount of multipole mode suppression as a star ascends the red-giant branch or to investigate the onset of the suppression in observed power spectral densities.
#### NH-rich organic compounds from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu: nanoscale spectral and isotopic characterizations

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of spectral bands at 3.06 um by MicrOmega, combined with the chemical identification of other NH-containing organic molecules in Ryugu samples, suggests the presence of potential NH-bearing compounds. However, the chemical forms of these NH-rich compounds, whether associated with N-rich organics, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4 or NH-organics-bearing phyllosilicates, or other forms, remain to be better understood. In this study, we report the characterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using multi-scale infrared (mm-reflectance, micro-FTIR, and nano-AFM-IR) and NanoSIMS techniques to constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components in the Ryugu asteroid. Our findings show that Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare, micrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (mainly due to C=O stretching of the amide I band) and 1550 cm-1 (mainly due to N-H bending vibration mode of the amide II band), indicative of amide-related compounds. In contrast, these compounds are absent in C0050. Notably, nitrogen isotopic analysis reveals that these amides in C0052 are depleted in 15N (d15N = -215 +/- 92 permil), confirming their indigenous origin, while carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions are indistinguishable from terrestrial values within errors (d13C = -22 +/- 52 and dD = 194 +/- 368 permil). The amides detected in C0052 could have formed through hydrothermal alteration from carboxylic acids and amines precursors on the Ryugu's parent planetesimal. Alternatively, they could have originated from the irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice by UV light or galactic cosmic rays, either at the surface of the asteroid in the outer Solar System or on mantle of interstellar dust grains in the interstellar medium. Amides delivered to early Earth by primitive small bodies, such as asteroid Ryugu, may have played a crucial role in prebiotic chemistry.
#### Validating and improving two-fluid simulations of the magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores

 - **Abstract**
 This paper addresses the evolution of an axially symmetric magnetic field in the core of a neutron star. The matter in the core is modeled as a system of two fluids, namely neutrons and charged particles, with slightly different velocity fields, controlled by their mutual collisional friction. This problem was addressed in our previous work through the so-called ``fictitious friction'' approach. We study the validity of our previous work and improve it by comparing the fictitious friction approach to alternatives, making approximations that allow it to be applied to arbitrary magnetic field strengths and using realistic equations of state. We assume the neutron star crust to be perfectly resistive, so its magnetic field reacts instantaneously to changes in the core, in which we neglect the effects of Cooper pairing. We explore different approaches to solve the equations to obtain the velocities and chemical potential perturbations induced by a given, fixed magnetic field configuration in the core. We also present a new version of our code to perform time-evolving simulations and discuss the results obtained with it. Our calculations without fictitious friction further confirm that bulk velocity is generally much greater than ambipolar velocity, leading to faster evolution. These findings align with those with fictitious friction, validating this approach. We also find that, in the long term, the star evolves towards a barotropic ``Grad-Shafranov equilibrium,'' where the magnetic force is fully balanced by charged particle fluid forces. Qualitatively, the evolution and the final equilibrium are independent of the magnetic field strength $B$ and the equation of state considered. The timescale to reach this equilibrium is proportional to $B^{-2}$ and becomes shorter for equations of state with a smaller gradient of the ratio between the densities of protons and neutrons.
