 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-angular-resolution observations indicate the need for core growth to form high-mass stars. To understand the gas dynamics at the core scale in the very early evolutionary stages before being severely affected by feedback, we have conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward a 70 $\mu$m dark massive clump, G337.541-00.082 as part of the Global and Local infall in the ASHES sample (GLASHES) program. Using dense gas tracers such as N$_2$H$^+$ ($J = 1-0$) and HNC ($J = 3-2$), we find signs of infall from the position-velocity diagram and more directly from the blue asymmetry profile in addition to the clump-scale velocity gradient. We estimate infall velocities from intermediate and low-mass cores to be 0.28-1.45 km s$^{-1}$, and infall rates to be on the order of 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, both are higher than those measured in low-mass star-forming regions by more than a factor of five and an order of magnitude, respectively. We find a strong correlation of the infall velocity with the nonthermal velocity dispersion, suggesting that infall may contribute significantly to the observed line width. Consistent with clump-fed scenarios, we show that the mass infall rate is larger for larger core masses and shorter distances to the clump center. Such high infall rates in cores embedded in IRDCs can be considered as strong signs of core growth, allowing high-mass star formation from intermediate-mass cores that would not initially form high-mass stars at their current mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Robotic telescope networks play an important role in capturing early and bright optical afterglows, providing critical insights into the energetics and emission mechanisms of GRBs. In this study, we analyze GRB 230204B, an exceptionally energetic and multi-pulsed long GRB, detected by the Fermi GBM and MAXI detectors, with an isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy exceeding 10$^{54}$ erg. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a transition in the prompt emission from hard (sub-photospheric dominated) spectra during early pulses to softer (synchrotron radiation dominated) spectra in later pulses, indicative of a hybrid jet composition. We report the discovery and characterization of the optical afterglow using the MASTER and BOOTES robotic telescope networks, alongside long-term radio observations extending to 335 days post-burst with the ATCA. At ~1.3 ks post-burst, the optical luminosity was exceptionally high, surpassing even other bright GRBs, such as GRB 221009A (the ``BOAT"). Multi-wavelength modeling, incorporating data from MASTER, BOOTES, DOT, Swift/XRT, and radio observations, was conducted using an external ISM forward-shock top-hat jet model with afterglowpy. The results reveal a narrow and highly collimated jet with a circumburst density of n$_{0}$ ~ 28.12 cm$^{-3}$, kinetic energy E$_{K}$ ~ 4.18 x 10$^{55}$ erg, and a relatively low value of $\epsilon_{B}$ = 2.14 x 10$^{-6}$, indicating shock-compression of the magnetic field in the surrounding interstellar medium. We constrained a low radiative efficiency of ~ 4.3 %. This study highlights the indispensable contribution of robotic networks to early afterglow observations and advances our understanding of GRB 230204B unique characteristics and underlying jet physics.

 - **Abstract**
 A potential difference of 1.3 Giga-Volts (GV) was inferred across a thundercloud using data from the GRAPES-3 muon telescope (G3MT). This was the first-ever estimation of gigavolt potential in thunderstorms, confirming prediction of C.T.R. Wilson almost a century ago. To infer the thundercloud potential required acceleration of muons in atmospheric electric field to be incorporated in the Monte Carlo simulation software CORSIKA. The G3MT records over 4 billion muons daily that are grouped into 169 directions covering 2.3 sr sky. This enabled changes as small as 0.1% in the muon flux on minute timescale, caused by thunderstorms to be accurately measured. But that requires high statistics simulation of muon fluxes in thunderstorm electric fields. The CORSIKA offers a choice of several generators for low- (FLUKA, GHEISHA, and UrQMD) and high-energy (SIBYLL, EPOS-LHC, and QGSJETII) hadronic interactions. Since it is unclear which combination of the low- and high-energy generators provides the correct description of hadronic interactions, all nine combinations of generators were explored, and they yielded thundercloud potentials ranging from 1.3 GV to 1.6 GV for the event recorded on 1 December 2014. The result of SIBYLL-FLUKA combination yielded the lowest electric potential of 1.3 GV was reported. Furthermore, another seven major thunderstorm events recorded between April 2011 and December 2020 were analyzed to measure the dependence of their thundercloud potential on the hadronic interaction generators. It is observed that the low-energy generators produce larger variation ($\sim$14%) in thundercloud potential than the high-energy generators ($\sim$8%). This probably reflects the fact that the GeV muons are predominantly produced in low-energy ($<$80 GeV) interactions, which effectively magnifies the differences in the meson production cross-sections among the low-energy generators.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae are triggered by accretion onto a white dwarf from a companion which is most likely Roche lobe-filling at the time of the explosion. The collision between the ejecta and a surviving companion carves out a conical wake, which could manifest as an asymmetry when the ejecta reaches the remnant phase. We simulate the companion interaction using the Athena++ hydrodynamics solver to determine the ejecta structure for a double-degenerate type Ia supernova. Ejecta in the wake is of lower density and higher velocity than the unperturbed ejecta. We then evolve the ejecta for several thousand years using the expanding-grid code Sprout. The forward shock within the wake is initially indented, but becomes spherical after roughly a thousand years due to transverse motion of shocked ejecta that fills the wake. The reverse shock travels quickly within the wake, leading to an off-center convergence of the reverse shock and leaving the remnant with an asymmetrical core. This also draws material from the interstellar medium deep into the remnant, eventually reaching the center. Large Rayleigh-Taylor plumes are found around the edge of the wake, creating a toroidal structure composed primarily of ejecta. Estimates of the thermal X-ray emission show that such remnants exhibit observable asymmetries for thousands of years.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars play an important role in the Universe. Unlike low-mass stars, the formation of these objects located at great distances is still unclear. It is expected to be governed by some combination of self-gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. In this work, we aim to study the chemical and physical conditions of dense clumps at different evolutionary stages. We performed observations towards 5 regions of massive star and stellar cluster formation (L1287, S187, S231, DR 21(OH), NGC 7538) with the IRAM-30m telescope. We covered the 2 and 3$-$4 mm wavelength bands and analysed the lines of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, HC$_3$N, HNCO, OCS, CS, SiO, SO$_2$, and SO. Using astrodendro algorithm on the 850 $\mu$m dust emission data from the SCUBA Legacy catalogue, we determined the masses, H$_2$ column densities, and sizes of the clumps. Furthermore, the kinetic temperatures, molecular abundances, and dynamical state were obtained. The Red Midcourse Space Experiment Source survey (RMS) was used to determine the clump types. A total of 20 clumps were identified. Three clumps were found to be associated with the Hii regions, 10 with young stellar objects (YSOs), and 7 with submillimetre emission. The clumps have typical sizes of about 0.2 pc and masses from 1 to 10$^{2}\,M_\odot$, kinetic temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 K and line widths of $\rm H^{13}CO^{+} (1-0)$ approximately 2 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$. We found no significant correlation in the line width$-$size and the line width$-$mass relationships. However, a strong correlation is observed in mass$-$size relationships. The virial analysis indicated that three clumps are gravitationally bound. Furthermore, we suggested that magnetic fields of about 1 mG provide additional support for clump stability. The molecular abundances relative to H$_2$ are approximately $10^{-10}-10^{-8}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Red supergiant stars (RSGs) represent the final evolutionary phase of the majority of massive stars and hold a unique role in testing the physics of stellar models. Eighty eight RSGs in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) were recently found to have an ultra-violet excess that was attributed to a B-type companion. We present follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) ultra-violet (1700 -- 3000\,Å) spectroscopy for 16 of these stars to investigate the nature of the UV excess and confirm the presence of a hot companion. In all cases we are able to confirm that the companion is a main-sequence B-type star based on the near-UV continuum. We determine effective temperatures, radii and luminosities from fitting the UV continuum with TLUSTY models and find stellar parameters in the expected range of SMC B-type stars. We display these results on a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram and assess the previously determined stellar parameters using UV photometry alone. From this comparison we conclude that UV photometric surveys are vital to identify such companions and UV spectroscopy is similarly vital to characterise the hot companions. From a comparison with IUE spectra of 32 Cyg, a well known RSG binary system in the Galaxy, four targets display evidence of being embedded in the wind of the RSG, like 32 Cyg, although none to the more extreme extent of VV Cep. The ages of six targets, determined via the stellar parameters of the hot companions, are found to be in tension with the ages determined for the RSG. A solution to this problem could be binary mass-transfer or red straggler stars.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of high-energy gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) involves complex synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-Compton scattering (SSC) mechanisms with multiple parameters exhibiting a wide distribution. Recent advancements in GRB research, particularly the observation of very high energy (VHE, $\rm >100~GeV$) radiation, have ushered in a new era of multiwavelength exploration, offering fresh perspectives and limitations for understanding GRB radiation mechanisms. This study aimed to leverage VHE observations to refine constraints on synchrotron + SSC radiation from electrons accelerated by forward shocks. By analyzing two external environments - the uniform interstellar medium and stratified stellar wind medium, we conducted spectral and variability fitting for five specific bursts (GRB~180720B, GRB~190114C, GRB~190829A, GRB~201216C, and GRB~221009A) to identify the optimal parameters characterizing these events. A comparative analysis of model parameter distributions with and without VHE radiation observations reveals that the magnetic energy equipartition factor $\epsilon_B$ is more concentrated with VHE emissions. This suggests that VHE emissions may offer greater constraints on this microphysical parameter. Additionally, we found that the energy budget between VHE and keV-MeV $\gamma$-ray emissions under the SSC radiation exhibits an almost linear relationship, which may serve as a tool to differentiate radiation mechanisms. We anticipate future statistical analyses of additional VHE bursts to validate our findings.
