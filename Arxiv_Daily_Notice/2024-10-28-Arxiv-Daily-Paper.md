 - **Abstract**
 Low-metallicity environments are subject to inefficient cooling. They also have low dust-to-gas ratios and therefore less efficient photoelectric (PE) heating than in solar-neighbourhood conditions, where PE heating is one of the most important heating processes in the warm neutral interstellar medium (ISM). We perform magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of stratified ISM patches with a gas metallicity of 0.02 Z$_\odot$ as part of the SILCC project. The simulations include non-equilibrium chemistry, heating, and cooling of the low-temperature ISM as well as anisotropic cosmic ray (CR) transport, and stellar tracks. We include stellar feedback in the form of far-UV and ionising (FUV and EUV) radiation, massive star winds, supernovae, and CR injection. From the local CR energy density, we compute a CR heating rate that is variable in space and time. In this way, we can compare the relative impact of PE and CR heating on the metal-poor ISM and find that CR heating can dominate over PE heating. Models with a uniform CR ionisation rate suppress or severely delay star formation, since they provide a larger amount of energy to the ISM due to CR heating. Models with a variable CR ionisation rate form stars predominantly in pristine regions with low PE heating and CR ionisation rates where the metal-poor gas is able to cool efficiently. Because of the low metallicity, the amount of formed stars in all runs is not enough to trigger outflows of gas from the mid-plane.
#### Implementation of Aerosol Mie Scattering in POSEIDON with Application to the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b's Transmission, Emission, and Reflected Light Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 Aerosols are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres and leave clear spectral imprints in exoplanet spectra. Pre-JWST, exoplanet retrieval frameworks mostly adopted simple parametric approximations. With JWST, we now have access to mid-infrared wavelengths where aerosols have detectable composition-specific resonance features. Here, we implement new features into the open-source atmospheric retrieval code POSEIDON to account for the complex scattering, reflection, and absorption properties of Mie scattering aerosols. We provide an open-source database of these Mie scattering cross sections and optical properties. We also extend the radiative transfer and retrieval functionality in POSEIDON to include multiple scattering reflection and emission spectroscopy. We demonstrate these new retrieval capabilities on archival Hubble and Spitzer transmission and secondary eclipse spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We find that a high-altitude, low-density, thin slab composed of sub-micron particles is necessary to fit HD 189733 b's transmission spectrum, with multiple aerosol species providing a good fit. We additionally retrieve a sub-solar H$_2$O abundance, a sub-solar K abundance, and do not detect CO$_2$. Our joint thermal and reflection retrievals of HD 189733 b's secondary eclipse spectrum, however, finds no evidence of dayside aerosols, a sub-solar dayside H$_2$O abundance, enhanced CO$_2$, and slighty sub-solar alkali abundances. We additionally explore how retrieval model choices, such as cloud parameterization, aerosol species and properties, and thermal structure parameterization affect retrieved atmospheric properties. Upcoming JWST data for hot Jupiters like HD 189733 b will be well suited to enable deeper exploration of aerosol properties, allowing the formulation of a self-consistent, multi-dimensional picture of cloud formation processes.
#### Presolar Grains As Probes of Supernova Nucleosynthesis
 - **Authors:** Nan Liu, Maria Lugaro, Jan Leitner, Bradley S. Meyer, Maria Schönbächler
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19254

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19254

 - **Abstract**
 We provide an overview of the isotopic signatures of presolar supernova grains, specifically focusing on 44Ti-containing grains with robustly inferred supernova origins and their implications for nucleosynthesis and mixing mechanisms in supernovae. Recent technique advancements have enabled the differentiation between radiogenic (from 44Ti decay) and nonradiogenic 44Ca excesses in presolar grains, made possible by enhanced spatial resolution of Ca-Ti isotope analyses with the Cameca NanoSIMS (Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) instrument. Within the context of presolar supernova grain data, we discuss (i) the production of 44Ti in supernovae and the impact of interstellar medium heterogeneities on the galactic chemical evolution of 44Ca/40Ca, (ii) the nucleosynthesis processes of neutron bursts and explosive H-burning in Type II supernovae, and (iii) challenges in identifying the progenitor supernovae for 54Cr-rich presolar nanospinel grains. Drawing on constraints and insights derived from presolar supernova grain data, we also provide an overview of our current understanding of the roles played by various supernova types - including Type II, Type Ia, and electron capture supernovae - in accounting for the diverse array of nucleosynthetic isotopic variations identified in bulk meteorites and meteoritic components. We briefly overview the potential mechanisms that have been proposed to explain these nucleosynthetic variations by describing the transport and distribution of presolar dust carriers in the protoplanetary disk. We highlight existing controversies in the interpretation of presolar grain data and meteoritic nucleosynthetic isotopic variations, while also outlining potential directions for future research.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19447

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.19447

 - **Abstract**
 We present systematic identifications of supergiants of M31/M33 based on massive LAMOST spectroscopic survey. Radial velocities of nearly 5000 photometrically selected M31/M33 supergiant candidates have been properly derived from the qualified spectra released in LAMOST DR10. By comparing their radial velocities with those predicted from the rotation curves of M31, as well as utilizing {\it Gaia} astrometric measurements to exclude foreground contaminations, 199 supergiant members in M31, including 168 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2', have been successfully identified. This sample contains 62 blue supergiants (BSGs, all `Rank1'), 134 yellow supergiants (YSGs, 103 `Rank1' and 31 `Rank2') and 3 red supergiants (RSGs, all `Rank1'). For M33, we identify 84 supergiant members (56 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2'), which includes 28 BSGs (all `Rank1'), 53 YSGs (25 `Rank1' and 28 `Rank2') and 3 RSGs (all `Rank1'). So far, this is one of the largest supergiant sample of M31/M33 with full optical wavelength coverage (3700 \textless $\lambda$ \textless 9100 Å). This sample is valuable for understanding the star formation and stellar evolution under different environments.
#### Magnetic massive stars: confirming the merger scenario for the magnetic field generation

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields are considered to be key components of massive stars, with a far-reaching impact on their evolution and ultimate fate. A magnetic mechanism was suggested for the collimated explosion of massive stars, relevant for long-duration gamma-ray bursts, X-ray flashes, and asymmetric core collapse supernovae. However, the origin of the observed stable, globally organized magnetic fields in massive stars is still a matter of debate: it has been argued that they can be fossil, dynamo generated, or generated by strong binary interactions or merging events. Taking into account that multiplicity is a fundamental characteristic of massive stars, observational evidence is accumulating that the magnetism originates through interaction between the system components, both during the initial mass transfer or when the stellar cores merge.
#### SNR G54.1+0.3, a PeVatron candidate unveiled by LHAASO

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the LHAASO Collaboration presented the first very-high-energy gamma-ray catalog, containing 90 TeV sources. Among these sources, 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u* is located 0.3$^\circ$ west of SNR G54.1 +0.3 and it also lies inside a $+53 \, \text{km s}^{-1}$ cloud (the Western Cloud) which may be associate with SNR G54.1+0.3. Moreover, one of IceCube's HESE track events is found at 1.3$^\circ$ north of 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u*. SNR G54.1+0.3 is young, with a powerful PWN inside. The X-ray radiation from the regions of SNR shell and PWN can be distinguished clearly. The radio emission from the PWN region is also available. However, due to the low angular resolution, the gamma-ray emission at the SNR by Fermi, HESS and VERITAS are considered as point sources. In this work, we explore a scenario that SNR G54.1 +0.3 is indeed associated with the Western Cloud and we derive the emissions from the PWN, the SNR shell, and the nearby molecular cloud. Our results can explain the multi-messenger observations, indicating that 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u* might be the excellent candidate of Galactic PeVatron.
