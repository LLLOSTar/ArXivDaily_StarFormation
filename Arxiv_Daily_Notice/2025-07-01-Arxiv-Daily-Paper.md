 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the "initial separation" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40°-80°). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical Cepheids are key astrophysical laboratories for studying stellar structure and evolution, and for calibrating the cosmic distance scale. Despite major progress, uncertainties remain regarding their masses, luminosities, distances, and the role of processes like core overshooting, rotation, and mass loss. The high-precision data from ESA Gaia's third data release offer an opportunity to address these issues. This study aims to estimate the structural parameters and distances of a sample of Classical Cepheids using non-linear convective pulsation models. It also tests the consistency of Gaia parallaxes, constrains the Mass Luminosity relation, and investigates the dependence of the projection factor (p-factor) on pulsation period. We analysed 46 Cepheids with precise Gaia DR3 photometry and radial velocities. Model fitting was performed by comparing predicted and observed light curves in Gaia G, GBP, and GRP bands, and radial velocity curves. Distances from the models were compared with Gaia parallaxes, including published corrections. Predicted masses and luminosities were used to constrain the ML relation; radial velocities allowed independent pfactor estimates. Distances show statistical agreement with Gaia parallaxes, requiring no additional global offset. Inferred masses and luminosities are consistent with evolution models including mild core overshooting, mass loss, or rotation. No significant period dependence of the pfactor is found, with a constant value of p = 1.22+/-0.05, consistent with recent studies. Results also agree with the Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity relation from Gaia DR3.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22699

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.

 - **Abstract**
 The association between long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (SNe) has been well established since the discovery of SN 1998bw, which was linked to the low-luminosity LGRB 980425. However, long-term monitoring of several well-localized, low-redshift LGRBs has yielded compelling evidence for the absence of accompanying supernovae. Notably, two long bursts, GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A, show signatures consistent with kilonova emission from compact binary mergers, indicating that at least some long events may originate from progenitors other than core-collapse supernovae. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of two samples of LGRBs, i.e., LGRBs with and without supernova associations, to investigate the differences that may reveal intrinsic distinctions in their progenitors. A detailed examination of their prompt emission properties, host galaxy environments, and event rates is performed. While the two samples exhibit considerable overlap in most observed properties, a significant discrepancy in their event rate is revealed. LGRBs without supernova association have an event rate that aligns well with the star formation rate, whereas that of SN-associated LGRBs differs significantly. It indicates that LGRBs without a supernova association may constitute a distinct subclass with intrinsically different progenitors.

 - **Abstract**
 Mapping the spatial distributions and abundances of complex organic molecules in hot cores and hot corinos is crucial for understanding the astrochemical pathways and the inheritance of prebiotic material by nascent planetary systems. However, the line-rich spectra from these sources pose significant challenges for robustly fitting molecular parameters due to severe line blending and unidentified lines. We present an efficient framework, Bayesian Active Spectral-cube Inference and Learning (BASIL), for estimating molecular parameter maps for hundreds of molecules based on the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, applied to wideband spectral datacubes of line-rich sources. We adopted stochastic variational inference to infer molecular parameters from spectra at individual positions, balancing between fitting accuracy and computational speed. For obtaining parameter maps, instead of querying every location or pixel, we introduced an active learning framework based on Bayesian quadrature and its parallelization. Specifically, we assessed and selected the locations or pixels of spectrum that are most informative for estimating the entire set of parameter maps by training a Gaussian processes model. By greedily selecting locations with maximum information gain, we achieve sublinear convergence. We benchmarked BASIL on a large synthetic datacube and demonstrated that it produces accurate 468 molecular parameter maps from 117 molecules within ~180 hours, orders of magnitude faster than traditional pixel-by-pixel fitting using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, with visually reliable results emerging in just ~20 hours. Additional training iterations provide progressively more accurate results. This quick visualization meets the demands of big data in modern astronomical surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: A large number of isolated black holes (IBHs) are expected to populate the Galaxy. However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a microlensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been reported so far. Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs moving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar medium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the accretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding medium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process. Furthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the accretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure, and the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding medium. Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be detected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from accretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current and forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the outflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges. Moreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium could be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with the gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred that radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible. Also, we derived that IBHs could be modest Galactic cosmic ray contributors, potentially reaching a 1% contribution at 1 PeV. Finally, by extending our model to primordial black holes, we conclude that efficient leptonic acceleration in their outflow medium interactions would rule them out as a major dark matter component.
#### The hydrodynamic thermal continuum, with applications to stratified atmospheres and 1D coronal loop models

 - **Abstract**
 Using both analytical and numerical means, we demonstrate that linear stability analysis of a hydrodynamic stratified atmosphere or a 1D coronal loop model in non-adiabatic settings features a thermal continuum corresponding to highly localized eigenfunctions. This thermal continuum can be precomputed, involving the net heat-loss function and its partial derivatives, and is the generalization of the thermal instability introduced by~\citet{Parker1953}. We account for a thermal imbalance, directly affecting thermal instability growthrates. We present completely general equations that govern all eigenmodes, including non-adiabatically affected p- and g-modes of the stratified settings. We intend to clarify how linear thermal instability is relevant for solar loops that show spontaneous in-situ condensations, and eliminate recent confusion on specific isochoric routes to linear instability alongside other thermal instability channels. The thermal continuum, previously identified as a crucial ingredient in magnetohydrodynamic eigenmode spectra for coronal loops and atmospheres, drives multithermal aspects across our universe, such as forming solar coronal rain and prominences, or cold cloud creation in intracluster to interstellar medium environments.
#### Studying the multi-phase interstellar medium in the Large Magellanic Cloud with SRG/eROSITA -- I. Analysis of diffuse X-ray emission

 - **Abstract**
 The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), being a nearby and actively star-forming satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an ideal site to observe the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy across the electromagnetic spectrum. We aim to exploit the available SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey data to study the distribution, composition and properties of the diffuse X-ray emitting hot gas in the LMC. We construct multi-band X-ray images of the LMC, reflecting the morphology and temperatures of the diffuse hot gas. By performing spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of 175 regions, we constrain the distribution, physical state, and composition of the hot ISM phase throughout the LMC. We combine our constraints with multiwavelength data to obtain a comprehensive view of the different ISM phases. We measure a total X-ray luminosity of the hot ISM phase of $1.9\times10^{38}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ ($0.2-5.0\,\mathrm{keV}$ band), and constrain its thermal energy to around $5\times10^{54}\,\mathrm{erg}$. The typical density and temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma are around $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ and $0.25\,\mathrm{keV}$, respectively, with both exhibiting broad peaks in the southeast of the LMC. The observed degree of X-ray absorption correlates strongly with the distribution of foreground HI gas, whereas a spatial anticorrelation between the hot and cold ISM phases is visible on sub-kpc scales within the disk. The abundances of light metals show a strong gradient throughout the LMC, with the north and east exhibiting a strong $\alpha$-enhancement, as expected from observed massive stellar populations there. In contrast, the enigmatic ``X-ray spur'' exhibits a local deficit in $\alpha$-elements, and a peak in hot-gas pressure at $P/k\sim10^5\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$, consistent with a dominant energy input through tidally driven gas collisions.
#### Macroscopic states in Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model with axionlike interaction

 - **Abstract**
 The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy NGC2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios. Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC2366 lie within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC2366's dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its total volume.
#### Exploring the Wolf Approach to Constraining NIR Extinction Laws in the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 The viability of the star count (Wolf) method is assessed as a means of constraining the near-infrared (NIR) extinction law toward the Corona Australis molecular cloud. Using deep $JHK_S$ photometry from the VISIONS survey, extinction maps with 1 arcmin spatial resolution are constructed. The derived extinction ratios are $A_J/A_H=1.73\pm0.07$, $A_H/A_{K_S}=1.70\pm0.11$, and $A_J/A_{K_S}=3.02\pm0.22$, which are consistent with Galactic literature means. Assuming a power-law form ($A_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$) for the NIR extinction law, we derive indices of $\alpha\approx 2.0$ across all wavelength combinations, with no statistically significant wavelength dependence throughout the NIR wavelength range. While spatial variations in extinction properties are tentatively observed across the cloud, concerns persist regarding the impact of photometric completeness, and the role of reference field selection. Continued research is required to refine the approach, and scrutinize the veracity of potential extinction law variations over a more expansive region of sky.
