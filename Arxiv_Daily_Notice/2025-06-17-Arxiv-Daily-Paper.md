 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the optical and near-infrared properties of SN 2022lxg, a bright ($\rm M_{g\, \mathrm{peak}}=-19.41$ mag) and rapidly evolving SN. It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in 10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data. The first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $>15,000$ K) with flash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase is marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the shapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~ $150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving unshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast decline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\pm$ 0.26 mag $\rm (50\,d)^{-1}$ in $g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until $+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a transition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II. However, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d. Its remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\rm M_B$ ~ $-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC value - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence (including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations from spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the observational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass transfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before it underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be more compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow supergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study on the dynamics of the quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the jet of BL~ Lacertae highlighted its significance in evaluating the physical properties of relativistic transverse waves in the parsec-scale jet. Motivated by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of 0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the 3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about $21\degr$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\approx 0.30\degr \pm 0.03\degr$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\overline{\beta_{\rm s}} \approx 15$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the QSC enables the classification and characterization of reversal patterns, which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave (abbrev.).

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Radio frequency molecular absorption lines appear along sight lines with AV well below 1 mag, revealing the presence of H2 in diffuse gas even when 2.6mm CO emission is absent. Aims. We discuss absorption lines of HCO+, C2H, HCN, CS, and HCO in a larger sample (88 sight lines) than was available before. Methods. We observed millimeter-wave absorption at the IRAM and ALMA interferometers over the past 30 years and gathered the results for to compare with observations of HCO+ and CO emission taken at the ARO KP12m and IRAM 30m telescopes. Results: We detected HCO+ along 72 of 86 sightlines where it was observed, C2H along 53 of 76 sightlines and HCN along 38 of 57 sightlines. C2H is ubiquitous and N(C2H)/N(HCO+) increases at smaller EB-V and smaller N(HCO+) but C2H absorption is intrinsically weaker, decreasing the number of sightlines with low column density along which it was this http URL dense-gas tracer HCN was uniformly detected down to N(H2) = 10^20 cm-2 with little change in the relative abundance N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.25. HCO was detected along only 4 of 46 sight lines that were newly observed at ALMA because its lines are intrinsically weak, but HCO is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium with N(HCO)/N(HCO+) = 1/3 or N(HCO)/N(H2) = 10^-9. The line widths of HCN features are (like those of CO) narrower than those of matching features observed in HCO+, and those of C2H are broader. HCO+ emission is commonly observed at log levels -2+/-0.3 dex with respect to CO emission.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of HS2 towards the cold dark cloud TMC-1. This is the first observation of a chemical species containing more than one sulphur atom in this type of sources. The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a line survey of TMC-1 in the Q band (31-50 GHz). The detection is confirmed by the observation of the fine and hyperfine components of two rotational transitions (2(0,2)-1(0,1) and 3(0,3)-2(0,2)). Assuming a rotational temperature of 7 K, we derived an HS2 column density of 5.7x10^11 cm-2, using a local thermodynamic equilibrium model that reproduces the observed spectra. The abundance of HS2 relative to H2 is 5.7x10^-11, which means that it is about seven times more abundant than its oxygenated counterpart HSO. We also explored the main formation and destruction mechanisms of HS2 using a chemical model, which reproduces the observed abundance of HS2 and indicates that dissociative recombination reactions from the ions H2S2+ and H3S2+ play a major role in forming HS2.

 - **Abstract**
 Core rotation rates of red-giant stars inferred from asteroseismic observations are substantially lower than predicted by current stellar models. This indicates the lack of an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism in radiative interiors. Mixed pressure-gravity modes are a promising candidate to extract angular momentum from the core of red giants. We focus on determining the effect of mixed modes on the rotation rates of stars evolving along the red giant branch (RGB). We developed a post-processing code that computes the angular momentum transport by meridional currents, shear-induced turbulence and mixed modes. Rotation rates were computed for models along the RGB with different stellar masses and different initial rotation profiles. We find that the mixed modes can explain some of the spin down observed in red giant stars, however, the values of non-radial mode amplitudes strongly affect the efficiency of this mechanism. Rotation rates from models neglecting radiative damping on the mixed mode amplitudes overlap with observations and produce a localised spin down around the hydrogen-burning shell, whereas the inclusion of radiative damping strongly suppresses and delays this spin down. We also show that including an additional viscosity term with values in the range $10^3-10^4$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ redistributes the localised spin down due to the mixed modes, enhancing their efficiency. Our results reveal that the mixed mode amplitudes need to be constraint to precisely quantify the spin down of red giant cores. Nevertheless, the mixed mode mechanism by itself cannot explain the full spread in observed core rotation rates along the RGB. This will only be possible with an additional mechanism for angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a large sample of 9617 molecular clouds (MCs) from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting survey, we mainly measure one-dimensional cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersions across a 450 deg$^{2}$ segment of the Local arm in the Galactic second quadrant. We define the cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion using two metrics: the standard deviation ($\sigma_{\rm bin}$) and flux-weighted root-mean-squared value ($\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$) of the centroid velocities of $^{12}$CO-detected MCs within spatial bins. The typical values of $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$ are 7.5$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 6.2$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. After categorizing clouds by sizes into three types: Type $S$ (0.15 $-$ 1.2 pc), Type $M$ (1.2 $-$ 4.8 pc), and Type L ($\gtrsim$ 4.8 pc), we find that the spatial distribution of Type $S$ and $M$ MCs projected onto the Galactic longitude-latitude (l-b) plane is generally uniform. Additionally, the cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion among Type $S$ clouds ($\sim$ 7.6 and 7.4 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$, respectively) is systematically greater than that among Type $M$ clouds ($\sim$ 6.7 and 6.0 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$, respectively), with differences of 0.9 $-$ 1.4 km s$^{-1}$. From these measurements, we estimate merger timescales between MCs to be approximately 0.3 to 0.9 Myr, which is shorter than their internal crossing timescales ($\sim$ 1 Myr for Type $S$, $\sim$ 2 Myr for Type $M$, and $\gtrsim$ 5 Myr for Type $L$). This disparity, particularly pronounced for larger Type $L$ clouds, suggests that MCs are dynamically transient structures, with their gas content changing due to frequent interactions with neighboring clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 How the large-scale kinematics of the Milky Way (MW) relate -- or even regulate -- the formation of large-to-small scale structures is incredibly hard to infer from observations. Here we investigate this interplay through a detailed analysis of a MW-like galaxy simulation, generated through the self-consistent evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter. We show that our model provides a close match to many of the MW's stellar structure and kinematic features (including in the inner Galaxy, and around the Solar neighbourhood), and find that the stellar spiral pattern in our model is very faint, with significantly less multiplicity than the sharper gaseous this http URL taken as an analogue to the MW, this finding would explain the difficulty in observational studies to agree on the number and location of our Galaxy's spiral arms. We also examine radial and tangential velocity residuals in the disc, and find that sharp kinematic transitions correlate with spiral arms, especially in the gas, where values reach $30 - 50$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We find strong radial converging flows promoting spiral-arm growth, while diverging flows disrupt them. A time-resolved analysis of spiral-ridge segments confirms that convergence precedes density enhancements and potential star-forming conditions, while divergence leads to fragmentation and mass redistribution. These patterns evolve on relatively short timescales ($\sim10-20$\,Myr), highlighting the transient nature of spiral arms. Our model's spiral arms are dynamically driven, short-lived features shaped by evolving flows, rather than static density waves, which could explain the observed lack of contrast of cloud properties and star formation within and outside spiral arms in the MW.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Very massive clusters and regions of intense star formation such as the center of our Milky Way contain young, hydrogen-burning stars very close to the Eddington Limit. Formally classified as hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, the winds and spectra of these stars are distinctively different to the more evolved, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars. Results. We find an overall downward trend of the mass-loss rate with increasing temperature and decreasing metallicity. However, at SMC metallicities and above, we find a maximum in the wind efficiency with the mass-loss eventually decreasing again at lower temperatures. For intermediate metallicities, we also find strong discontinuities in the mass-loss trends, which do not appear at high or very low metallicities. For the lowest metallicities, a more homogeneous behavior is obtained without any maximum in the wind efficiency. The terminal velocities are generally higher for hotter temperatures. For cooler temperatures, the combined effect of metallicity and mass-loss change significantly reduces the changes in terminal velocity with metallicity. Conclusions. Contrary to cWR stars, the spectral appearance of late-type WNh stars rules out supersonic winds launched at the hot iron bump. Instead, a more extended quasi-hydrostatic regime is necessary. The proximity to the Eddington limit and the complex interactions cause a lot of substructure in the global wind parameter trends. While the strong discontinuities show resemblances to the bi-stability jump predicted for the B-supergiant regime, our models reveal a more complex origin. At sub-SMC metallicity, iron is no longer a major key for setting the mass-loss rate in this WNh regime. Instead, other elements (e.g. nitrogen) and continuum contributions become important.
#### Planetary waves can activate resonant drag instabilities in 3D dusty gaseous discs

 - **Abstract**
 Resonant Drag Instabilities (RDIs) in protoplanetary discs are driven by the aerodynamic back-reaction of dust on gas and occur when the relative dust-gas motion resonate with a wave mode intrinsic to the gas fluid. Axisymmetric models indicate that the RDI generates filamentary perturbations, leading to grain clumping and planetesimal formation. Motivated by these findings, we investigate the dust-gas interaction in a non-axisymmetric inviscid protoplanetary disc with an embedded low-mass planet ($M_{\mathrm{p}}\in[0.3, 3] M_\oplus$, here $M_\oplus$ is the Earth mass). We conduct global 3D high-resolution two-fluid simulations, with the dust being parametrized by the Stokes number $\mathrm{St}\in[0.01,0.5]$. We find that planetary waves (PWs; also known as Rossby waves), which propagate along the downstream separatrices of the horseshoe region, resonate with the streaming motion and trigger the RDI. The consequent development of a global-scale filamentary dust distribution does not sensitively depend on the Stokes number, nor does it depend on the fast dust settling that takes place in an inviscid disc. The rapid onset of this instability, which is comparable to the dynamical orbital time-scale, suppresses the formation of asymmetric structures in the dust in the vicinity of the planet (such as dust voids and filaments). Additionally, we find that the dust feedback enables buoyancy resonances in an otherwise non-buoyant (globally isothermal) disc. Therefore, our results provide the first numerical evidence of RDIs generation driven by planetary waves.
#### KRIOS: A new basis-expansion $N$-body code for collisional stellar dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational $N$-body problem is a nearly universal problem in astrophysics which, despite its deceptive simplicity, still presents a significant computational challenge. For collisional systems such as dense star clusters, the need to resolve individual encounters between $N$ stars makes the direct summation of forces - with quadratic complexity - almost infeasible for systems with $N\gtrsim 10^6$ particles over many relaxation times. At the same time, the most common Monte Carlo $N$-body algorithm - that of Hénon - assumes the cluster to be spherically symmetric. This greatly limits the study of many important features of star clusters, including triaxiality, rotation, and the production of tidal debris. In this paper, we present a new hybrid code, KRIOS, that combines 3D collisionless relaxation using an adaptive self-consistent field method with a collisional dynamics part handled via Hénon's method. We demonstrate that KRIOS can accurately model the long-term evolution of clusters and provide its complete phase-space information over many relaxation times. As a test of our new code, we present detailed comparisons to two well-known results from stellar dynamics: (i) the collisional evolution of an isotropic Plummer sphere to core collapse, and (ii) the emergence of the radial-orbit instability in radially anisotropic star clusters, including its non-spherical effects.
#### Supernova explosions of runaway stars and young neutron stars above the Galactic plane

 - **Abstract**
 Several supernova remnants and young neutron stars were recently discovered relatively high above the Galactic plane. One possibility is that they originate from runaway OB stars born in the Galactic disk. Understanding their origin will provide key insights into the properties of the Galactic halo. This paper aims to determine the spatial distribution of supernova explosions from runaway OB stars and to assess whether this model can explain certain observed neutron stars. We map the distribution of supernova events produced by runaway OB stars by incorporating their birth rate, initial spatial distribution, lifetime, ejection mechanisms, and velocity distributions. By tracking their motion in the Galactic potential, we determine their final distribution right before the explosion. We show that the neutron star Calvera, which is found at z around 2.2 kpc, could have originated from a runaway OB star. In addition, we compare the probabilities of finding a supernova remnant originating from Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae high above the Galactic plane, showing that supernova remnants related to core-collapse supernovae outnumber those related to Type Ia supernovae.

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the twin branch. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.
