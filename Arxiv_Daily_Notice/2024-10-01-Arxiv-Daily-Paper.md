 - **Abstract**
 Context. Clouds are ubiquitous in exoplanets' atmospheres and play an important role in setting the opacity and chemical inventory of the atmosphere. Understanding clouds is a critical step in interpreting exoplanets' spectroscopic data. Aims. The aim is to model the multi-species nature of clouds in atmospheric retrieval studies. To this end, we develop ExoLyn - a 1D cloud model that balances physical consistency with computational efficiency. Methods. ExoLyn solves the transport equation of cloud particles and vapor under cloud condensation rates that are self-consistently calculated from thermodynamics. ExoLyn is a standalone, open source package capable to be combined with \texttt{optool} to calculate solid opacities and with \texttt{petitRADTRANS} to generate transmission or emission spectra. Results. With ExoLyn we find that the compositional structure of clouds in hot Jupiter planets' atmospheres is layered with a cloud dominated by magnesium-silicates on top of an iron cloud. This finding is consistent with more complex cloud formation models but can be obtained with ExoLyn in only a few seconds. The composition of the cloud particles can be constrained from the spectrum, for example, MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4 components give rise to an absorption feature at 8 - 10 um. We investigate the dependence of the cloud structure on the bulk elemental composition of the planet and find that SiO2-dominated clouds forms on metal-rich planet and Fe clouds with strong extinction effect forms on C-rich planet. Conclusions. Designed towards maximum flexibility, ExoLyn can also be used in retrieval analysis of sub-Neptunes and self-luminous planets. The efficiency of ExoLyn opens the possibility of joint retrieval of exoplanets' gas and cloud components.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the 1D stellar evolution of a 16.5 M$_{\odot}$ zero-age main-sequence star having different initial rotations. Starting from the pre-main-sequence, the models evolve up to the onset of the core collapse stage. The collapse of such a massive star can result in several kinds of energetic transients, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Supernovae, etc. Using the simulation parameters, we calculate their free-fall timescales when the models reach the stage of the onset of core collapse. Estimating the free-fall timescale is crucial for understanding the duration for which the central engine can be fueled, allowing us to compare the free-fall timescale with the T$_{\rm 90}$ duration of GRBs. Our results indicate that, given the constraints of the parameters and initial conditions in our models, rapidly rotating massive stars might serve as potential progenitors of Ultra-Long GRBs (T$_{\rm 90}$ $>>$ 500 sec). In contrast, the non-rotating or slowly rotating models are more prone to explode as hydrogen-rich Type IIP-like core-collapse supernovae.
#### Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of HI Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood. II. Constraints from a Large Catalog of 21 cm Absorption Observations at High Galactic Latitudes

 - **Abstract**
 The cold neutral medium (CNM) is where neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) is converted into molecular clouds, so the structure and kinematics of the CNM are key drivers of galaxy evolution. Here we provide new constraints on the vertical distribution of the CNM using the recently-developed $\texttt{kinematic_scaleheight}$ software package and a large catalog of sensitive HI absorption observations. We estimate the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood to be $\sigma_z\sim50$$\unicode{x2013}$$90~\mathrm{pc}$, assuming a Gaussian vertical distribution. This is a factor of $\sim2$ smaller than typically assumed, indicating the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood is similar to that found in the inner Galaxy, consistent with recent simulation results. If we consider only structures with HI optical depths $\tau>0.1$ or column densities $N(\mathrm{HI})>10^{19.5}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, which recent work suggests are thresholds for molecule formation, we find $\sigma_z\sim50~\mathrm{pc}$. Meanwhile, for structures with $\tau<0.1$ or column densities $N(\mathrm{HI})<10^{19.5}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, we find $\sigma_z\sim120~\mathrm{pc}$. These thicknesses are similar to those derived for the thin- and thick-disk molecular cloud populations traced by CO emission, possibly suggesting that cold HI and CO are well-mixed. Approximately $20\%$ of CNM structures are identified as outliers, with kinematics that are not well-explained by Galactic rotation. We show that some of these CNM structures $\unicode{x2014}$ perhaps representing intermediate velocity clouds $\unicode{x2014}$ are associated with the Local Bubble wall. We compare our results to recent observations and simulations, and we discuss their implications for the multiphase structure of the Milky Way's interstellar medium.

 - **Abstract**
 We report a new, reliable determination of the CN excitation temperature of diffuse molecular clouds in the Milky Way, based on ultra high spectral resolution observations. Our determination is based on CN $B^{2}\Sigma^{+}-X^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0) vibrational band absorption spectra seen along the lines of sight to eight bright Galactic stars. Our analysis is conducted blind, and we account for multiple sources of systematic uncertainty. Like previous studies, our excitation temperature measures exhibit an intrinsic scatter that exceeds the quoted uncertainties. Accounting for this scatter, we derive a 3% determination of the typical CN excitation temperature, $T_{01}=2.769^{+0.084}_{-0.072}~{\rm K}$, which is consistent with the direct determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We also perform a single joint fit to all sightlines, and find that our data can be simultaneously fit with an excitation temperature $T_{01}=2.725\pm0.015~{\rm K}$ -- a 0.55% measure that is consistent with the CMB temperature. We propose a future observational strategy to reduce systematic uncertainties and firmly test the limitations of using CN as a cosmic microwave background thermometer.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.
#### High-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions from interacting supernovae based on radiation hydrodynamic simulations: a case of SN 2023ixf

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of core-collapse supernovae revealed that the existence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) around their progenitors is ubiquitous. Interaction of supernova ejecta with such a dense CSM is a potential production sight of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs), gamma-rays, and neutrinos. We estimate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals from SN 2023ixf, a core-collapse supernova occurred in a nearby galaxy M101, which exhibits signatures of the interaction with the confined dense CSM. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulation model calibrated by the optical and ultraviolet observations of SN 2023ixf, we find that the CRs cannot be accelerated in the early phase because the sharp velocity jump at the shock disappears due to strong radiation pressure. Roughly 4 days after the explosion, the collisionless sub-shock is formed in the CSM, which enables the CR production and leads to gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. The shock sweeps up the entire dense CSM roughly 9 days after the explosion, which ceases the high-energy radiation. Based on this scenario, we calculate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals, which have a peak around 9 days after the explosion. We can constrain the cosmic-ray production efficiency to be less than 30\% by comparing our prediction to the Fermi-LAT data. Future multi-messenger observations with an enlarged sample of nearby supernovae will provide a better constraint on the cosmic-ray production efficiency in the early phases of supernovae.
