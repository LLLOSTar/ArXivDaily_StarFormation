 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of TOI-3493 b, a sub-Neptune-sized planet on an 8.15-d orbit transiting the bright (V=9.3) G0 star HD 119355 (aka TIC 203377303) initially identified by NASA's TESS space mission. With the aim of confirming the planetary nature of the transit signal detected by TESS and determining the mass of the planet, we performed an intensive Doppler campaign with the HARPS spectrograph, collecting radial velocity measurements. We found that TOI-3493 b lies in a nearly circular orbit and has a mass of 9.0+/-1.2 M_earth and a radius of 3.22+/-0.08 R_earth, implying a bulk density of 1.47+/-0.23 g/cm^3, consistent with a composition comprising a small solid core surrounded by a thick H/He dominated atmosphere.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the AGB population of the galaxy M31, based on available HST and Spitzer data, to characterize the individual sources in terms of mass, metallicity and formation epoch of the progenitors. Particular attention is dedicated to the derivation of the dust production rate of the stars, in the attempt of determining the global current dust production rate of the galaxy, divided between the silicates and the carbonaceous dust contributions. We use results from stellar evolution modelling complemented by the description of the dust formation process in the wind, to be used in a population synthesis approach, based on the star formation history and age-metallicity relationship obtained in previous investigations. The comparison between the results from synthetic modelling and the data available are used for the characterization of AGB stars in M31. We find that the bulk of the AGB population of M31 is composed by low-mass stars of different metallicity formed between 6 Gyr and 14 Gyr ago, with an additional, significant contribution from the progeny of 1.7-2.5Msun stars formed during the secondary peak in the star formation, which occurred between 1 and 2 Gyr ago. The dust production rate of the galaxy is mostly provided by carbon stars, whose contribution is of the order of 4x10^{-4} Msun/yr, completed by silicates production from massive AGB stars, occurring at a rate of 6x10^{-5} Msun/yr. The implications of the present results on the reliability of AGB modelling are also commented.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of molecular line emission is crucial to unveil the kinematics and the physical conditions of gas in star-forming regions. Our aim is to quantify the reliability of using individual molecular transitions to derive physical properties of the bulk of the H2 gas, looking at morphological correlations in their overall integrated molecular line emission with the cold dust. For this study we selected transitions of H2CO, CH$_3$OH, DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OCHO, SO, and SiO and compared them with the 1.38 mm dust continuum emission at different spatial scales in the ALMAGAL sample, that observed a total of 1013 targets covering all evolutionary stages of the high-mass star-formation process and different conditions of clump fragmentation. We used the method of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) implemented in the tool astroHOG to compare the morphology of integrated line emission with maps of the 1.38 mm dust continuum emission. Moreover, we calculated the Spearman's correlation coefficient, and compared it with our astroHOG results. Only H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, and SO show emission on spatial scales comparable with the diffuse continuum emission. However, from the HOG method, the median correlation of the emission of each of these species with the continuum is only $\sim$24-29%. In comparison with the dense fragments these molecular species still have low values of correlation. On the other hand DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN, and CH$_3$OCHO show a good correlation with the dense dust fragments, above 60%. The worst correlation is seen with SiO, both with the extended continuum emission and with compact sources. From the comparison of the results of the HOG method and the Spearman's correlation coefficient, the HOG method gives much more reliable results than the intensity-based coefficient in estimating the level of similarity of the emission morphology.
#### Calibrating the SIDM Gravothermal Catastrophe with N-body Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) theories predict that dark matter halos experience core-collapse in late-stage evolution, a process where the halo's inner region rapidly increases in density and decreases in size. This process can be modeled by treating the dark matter as a gravothermal fluid, and solving the fluid equations to predict the density profile evolution. This model is incomplete without calibration to N-body simulations, through a constant factor $\beta$ included in the thermal conductivity for the long-mean-free-path limit. The value of $\beta$ employed in the gravothermal fluid formalism has varied between studies, with no clear universal value in the literature. In this work, we use the N-body code Arepo to conduct a series of isolated core-collapse simulations across a range of scattering cross-sections, halo concentrations, and halo masses to calibrate the heat transfer parameter $\beta$. We find that $\beta$ is independent of cross-section, halo concentration, and halo mass for velocity independent elastic scattering cross-sections. We present a model for an effective $\beta$ as a function of a dimensionless cross-section, to describe halo evolution in the long mean free path limit, and show that it accurately captures halo evolution as long as the cross section is not too large. This effective model facilitates comparisons between simulations and the gravothermal model, and enables fast predictions of the dark matter density profile at any given time without running N-body simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanoflares, which are consequences of braids in tangled magnetic fields, are an important candidate to heat the solar corona to million degrees. However, their observational evidence is sparse and many of their observational characteristics are yet to be discovered. With the high-resolution observations taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Orbiter, here we study a series of ejections of plasma blobs resulted from a braided magnetic loops in the upper transition region and reveal some critical characteristics of such processes. The cores of these ejections have a size of about 700\,km, a duration less than 1 minute and a speed of about 90\,\kms. An important characteristic is that these plasma blobs are apparently constrained by the post-reconnection magnetic loops, along which they show an extension of up to about 2\,000\,km. The propagation of unbraiding nodes along the main axis of the tangled loops has a speed of about 45\,\kms. The separation angles between the post-reconnection loops and the main axis of the tangled loops are about 30\degree. The observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly reveal that the braiding loops are upper transition region structures. Based on these observations, the typical magnetic free energy producing a blob is estimated to be about $3.4\times10^{23}$\,erg, well in the nano-flare regime, while the kinematic energy of a blob is about $2.3\times10^{23}$\,erg, suggesting that a majority of magnetic free energy in a magnetic braid is likely transferred into kinematic energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Context: Recent JWST measurements allow access to the near-infrared spectrum of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, for which two different interpretations, a high-metallicity miscible envelope and a lower metallicity hycean world, are currently in conflict. Aims: Here, we reanalyze the published data and reproduce previously retrieved molecular abundances based on an independent data reduction and a different retrieval framework. The aim of this study is to refine the understanding of TOI-270 d and highlight considerations for JWST data analysis. Additionally, we test the impact of data resolution on atmospheric retrieval calculations. Methods: We reduce one JWST NIRSpec G395H and one NIRISS SOSS GR700XD transit dataset using the Eureka! pipeline and a custom MCMC-based light curve fitting algorithm at the instruments' native resolutions. The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR retrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions. Results: Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at the red end of the NIRISS data. Our retrievals support a higher mean molecular weight atmosphere for TOI-270 d. We provide refined abundance constraints and find statistically favored model extensions indicating either sulfur-rich chemistry with species such as CS2, CS, and H2CS, or the possible presence of CH3Cl or CH3F. However, Bayesian inference cannot distinguish between these scenarios due to similar opacities below 4 microns. Conclusions: Our analysis reinforces TOI-270 d as a highly interesting warm sub-Neptune for atmospheric studies, with a complex chemistry in a cloud-free upper atmosphere. However, its exact nature remains uncertain and warrants further detailed photochemical modeling and observations.
