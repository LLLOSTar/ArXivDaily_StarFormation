#### The Optical Extinction Law Depends on Magnetic Field Orientation: The $R_V$-$\psi$ Relation
 - **Authors:** Brandon S. Hensley
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16839

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16839

 - **Abstract**
 For aspherical interstellar dust grains aligned with their short axes preferentially parallel to the local magnetic field, the amount of extinction per grain is larger when the magnetic field is along the line of sight and smaller when in the plane of the sky. To the extent that optical extinction arises from both aligned and unaligned grain populations with different extinction properties, changes in the magnetic field orientation induces changes in its wavelength dependence, parameterized by $R_V \equiv A_V/E(B-V)$. We demonstrate that the measured total and polarized extinction curves of the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium imply $R_V$ varies from 3.21 when the magnetic field is along the line of sight ($\psi = 0$) to $R_V = 3.05$ when in the plane of the sky ($\psi = 90^\circ$). This effect could therefore account for much of the large-scale $R_V$ variation observed across the sky ($\sigma(R_V) \simeq 0.2$), particularly at high Galactic latitudes.
#### Critical Condition of Core-Collapse Supernovae I: One Dimensional Models

 - **Abstract**
 When the core of a massive star collapses, neutrino heating can energize the stalled accretion shock, leading to a successful supernova. The critical condition that characterizes the transition from accretion to explosion is a central topic of study and is often characterized by a critical proto-neutron star (PNS) neutrino luminosity $L_\nu^{\rm crit}$, which depends on the post-collapse mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ from the progenitor. We examine the critical condition by solving the spherically symmetric time-dependent Euler equations with a general equation of state and realistic microphysics for a range of $\dot{M}$, average neutrino energy $\left< \epsilon_{\nu}\right>$, luminosity $L_{\nu}$, PNS radius $R_{\star}$, mass $M_{\star}$, and pre-shock Mach number $\mathcal{M}$ for a fixed neutrino optical depth from the PNS surface of $2/3$. We derive $L_{\nu}^{\mathrm{crit}}$ as a function of the input parameters. We show that pressurized pre-shock flow, as parameterized by low $\mathcal{M}$, changes the normalization of the critical condition because accretion of higher entropy shells at later times after collapse leads to lower $L_{\nu}^{\mathrm{crit}}$. We connect this finding to the onset of explosion due to compositional interface accretion. Across our parameter space, we test critical conditions that have been proposed in the literature, including the ``antesonic" condition, the ``force explosion condition," and the heuristic heating-advection timescale condition. We discuss how shock oscillations impact these critical conditions. Compared to other explosion conditions, we find that the antesonic ratio shows the least variation across the model space we explore. This work is preparatory for similar experiments in 2D axisymmetry and 3D.
#### Water-rich sub-Neptunes and rocky super Earths around different Stars: Radii shaped by Volatile Partitioning, Formation, and Evolution
 - **Authors:** Remo Burn, Komal Bali, Caroline Dorn, Rafael Luque, Simon L. Grimm
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16879

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16879

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of sub-Neptunes remains unknown due to degeneracies in interior structure solutions. However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii has been compiled. It can be used to test the prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes by planet formation theory. We want to find out whether this water reservoir is included in photoevaporative winds and how much of it can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or complete segregation. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is best matched under the mixed assumption without water sequestration to the interior. We quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass. Fractionation is not found to significantly alter the composition of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. In contrast, water sequestration has a profound effect on the radius evolution and compositional budget of the planets. The model predicts the preservation of large quantities of water even if the gaseous envelope is lost. Planets with corresponding bulk densities are not observed in comparably large numbers. By combining formation and evolution model, we probe a parameter space favored by core accretion theory. We conclude that the dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps for comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction.

#### The deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ in massive star-forming regions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17121

 - **Abstract**
 Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.
#### High strehl and high contrast for the ELT instrument METIS - Final design, implementation, and predicted performance of the single-conjugate adaptive optics system

 - **Abstract**
 The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) is a first-generation instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Europe's next-generation 39 m ground-based telescope for optical and infrared wavelengths. METIS will offer diffraction-limited imaging, low- and medium-resolution slit spectroscopy, and coronagraphy for high-contrast imaging between 3 and 13 microns, as well as high-resolution integral field spectroscopy between 3 and 5 microns. The main METIS science goals are the detection and characterisation of exoplanets, the investigation of proto-planetary disks, and the formation of planets. The Single-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) system corrects atmospheric distortions and is thus essential for diffraction-limited observations with METIS. Numerous challenging aspects of an ELT Adaptive Optics (AO) system are addressed in the mature designs for the SCAO control system and the SCAO hardware module: the complex interaction with the telescope entities that participate in the AO control, wavefront reconstruction with a fragmented and moving pupil, secondary control tasks to deal with differential image motion, non-common path aberrations and mis-registration. A K-band pyramid wavefront sensor and a GPU-based Real-Time Computer (RTC), tailored to the needs of METIS at the ELT, are core components. This current paper serves as a natural sequel to our previous work presented in Hippler et al. (2018). It includes updated performance estimations in terms of several key performance indicators, including achieved contrast curves. We outline all important design decisions that were taken, and present the major challenges we faced and the main analyses carried out to arrive at these decisions and eventually the final design. We also elaborate on our testing and verification strategy, and, last not least, comprehensively present the full design, hardware and software.

 - **Abstract**
 Interior compositions are key for our understanding of Earth-like exoplanets. The composition of the core can influence the presence of a magnetic dynamo and the strength of gravity on the planetary surface, both of which heavily impact thermal and possible biological processes and thus the habitability for life and its evolution on the planet. However, detailed measurements of the planetary interiors are extremely challenging for small exoplanets, and existing data suggest a wide diversity in planet compositions. Hitherto, only certain photospheric chemical abundances of the host stars have been considered as tracers to explain the diversity of exoplanet compositions. Here we present a homogeneous analysis of stars hosting rocky exoplanets, with ages between 2 and 14 Gyr, revealing a correlation between rocky exoplanet compositions and the ages of the planetary systems. Denser rocky planets are found around younger stars. This suggests that the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets can be linked to the ages of their host stars. We interpret this to be a result of chemical evolution of stars in the Milky Way, which modifies the material out of which stars and planets form. The results imply that rocky planets which form today, at similar galactocentric radii, may have different formation conditions, and thus different properties than planets which formed several billion years ago, such as the Earth.
#### Kinetic Field Theory Applied to Planetesimal Formation I: Freely Streaming Dust Particles

 - **Abstract**
 Planet formation in the solar system was started when the first planetesimals were formed from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. Numerical simulations of this process, especially in the framework of streaming instability, produce various power laws for the initial mass function for planetesimals. While recent advances have shed light on turbulence and its role in particle clustering, a comprehensive theoretical framework linking turbulence characteristics to particle cluster properties and planetesimal mass function remains incomplete. Recently, a kinetic field theory for ensembles of point-like classical particles in or out of equilibrium has been applied to cosmic structure formation. This theory encodes the dynamics of a classical particle ensemble by a generating functional specified by the initial probability distribution of particles in phase space and their equations of motion. Here, we apply kinetic field theory to planetesimal formation. A model for the initial probability distribution of dust particles in phase space is obtained from a quasi-initial state for a three-dimensional streaming-instability simulation that is a particle distribution with velocities for gas and particles from the Nakagawa relations. The equations of motion are chosen for the simplest case of freely streaming particles. We calculate the non-linearly evolved density power spectrum of dust particles and find that it develops a universal $k^{-3}$ tail at small scales, suggesting scale-invariant structure formation below a characteristic and time-dependent length scale. Thus, the KFT analysis indicates that the initial state for streaming instability simulations does not impose a constraint on structure evolution during planetesimal formation.
#### Dimming events of evolved stars due to clouds of molecular gas. Scenarios based on 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with CO5BOLD

 - **Abstract**
 The dramatic dimming episode of the red supergiant Betelgeuse in 2019/2020, caused by a partial darkening of the stellar disk, has highlighted gaps in the understanding of the evolution of massive stars. We analyzed numerical models to investigate the processes behind the formation of dark surface patches and the associated reduction in the disk-integrated stellar light. With the CO5BOLD code, we performed global 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of evolved stars, including convection in the stellar interior, self-excited pulsations, and the resulting atmospheric dynamics with strong radiative shocks. We attribute dimming phenomena to obscuring clouds of cool gas in the lower atmosphere, forming according to three different scenarios. One process transports material outward in a strong shock, similar to what occurs in 1D simulations of radially pulsating AGB stars. Another mechanism is triggered by a large convective upflow structure, in combination with exceptionally strong radial pulsations. This induces Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, causing plumes of material to be sent outward into the atmosphere. The third and rarest scenario involves large-amplitude convective fluctuations, leading to enhanced flows in deep downdrafts, which rebound and send material outward. In all cases, the dense gas above the stellar surface cools and darkens rapidly in visible light. AGB stars show localized dark patches regularly during intermediate phases of their large-amplitude pulsations, while more massive stars will only intermittently form such patches during luminosity minima. The episodic levitation of dense gas clumps above the stellar surface, followed by the formation of complex molecules in the cooling gas and possibly dust grains at a later stage, can account for the dark patches and strong dimming events of supergiant stars such as Betelgeuse.
#### Association between Recurrent Novae and Nova Super-Remnants

 - **Abstract**
 Nova super-remnants (NSRs) are substantially extended structures (>100 parsecs) encompassing recurrent novae. NSRs grow as a result of frequent nova eruptions transporting vast quantities of the locally surrounding interstellar medium away from the binary system over many millennia into a thin high-density shell, as the central white dwarf grows towards the Chandrasekhar limit. The prototypical NSR, first identified as such in 2014, is situated in the Andromeda Galaxy and belongs to the annually erupting nova, M31N 2008-12a (or '12a'). In this short review, modelling of evolving NSRs (including the 12a NSR) will be outlined as motivation towards searching for more of these phenomena in the Galaxy and beyond. The latest developments in this upcoming subfield of nova research will then be presented including the discovery of two new Galactic nova super-remnants (and their consequent modelling) and the first survey undertaken with the sole purpose of finding NSRs in the Andromeda Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.
#### The JCMT BISTRO Survey: The magnetised evolution of star-forming cores in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud interpreted using Histograms of Relative Orientation

 - **Abstract**
 The relationship between B-field orientation and density structure in molecular clouds is often assessed using the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO). We perform a plane-of-the-sky geometrical analysis of projected B-fields, by interpreting HROs in dense, spheroidal, prestellar and protostellar cores. We use James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) POL-2 850 $\mu$m polarisation maps and Herschel column density maps to study dense cores in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex. We construct two-dimensional core models, assuming Plummer column density profiles and modelling both linear and hourglass B-fields. We find high-aspect-ratio ellipsoidal cores produce strong HRO signals, as measured using the shape parameter $\xi$. Cores with linear fields oriented $< 45^{\circ}$ from their minor axis produce constant HROs with $-1 < \xi < 0$, indicating fields are preferentially parallel to column density gradients. Fields parallel to the core minor axis produce the most negative value of $\xi$. For low-aspect-ratio cores, $\xi \approx 0$ for linear fields. Hourglass fields produce a minimum in $\xi$ at intermediate densities in all cases, converging to the minor-axis-parallel linear field value at high and low column densities. We create HROs for six dense cores in Ophiuchus. $\rho$ Oph A and IRAS 16293 have high aspect ratios and preferentially negative HROs, consistent with moderately strong-field behaviour. $\rho$ Oph C, L1689A and L1689B have low aspect ratios, and $\xi \approx 0$. $\rho$ Oph B is too complex to be modelled using a simple spheroidal field geometry. We see no signature of hourglass fields, agreeing with previous findings that dense cores generally exhibit linear fields on these size scales.
#### Tungsten isotope evolution during Earth's formation and new constraints on the viability of accretion simulations

 - **Abstract**
 The Hf-W isotopic system is the reference chronometer for determining the chronology of Earth's accretion and differentiation. However, its results depend strongly on uncertain parameters, including the extent of metal-silicate equilibration and the siderophility of tungsten. Here we show that a multistage core-formation model based on N-body accretion simulations, element mass balance and metal-silicate partitioning, largely eliminates these uncertainties. We modified the original model of Rubie et al. (2015) by including (1) smoothed particle hydrodynamics estimates of the depth of melting caused by giant impacts and (2) the isotopic evolution of 182W. We applied two metal-silicate fractionation mechanisms: one when the metal delivered by the cores of large impactors equilibrates with only a small fraction of the impact-induced magma pond and the other when metal delivered by small impactors emulsifies in global magma oceans before undergoing progressive segregation. The latter is crucial for fitting the W abundance and 182W anomaly of Earth's mantle. In addition, we show, for the first time, that the duration of magma ocean solidification has a major effect on Earth's tungsten isotope anomaly. We re-evaluate the six Grand Tack N-body simulations of Rubie et al. (2015). Only one reproduces epsilon182W=1.9+/-0.1 of Earth's mantle, otherwise accretion is either too fast or too slow. Depending on the characteristics of the giant impacts, results predict that the Moon formed either 143-183 Myr or 53-62 Myr after the start of the solar system. Thus, independent evaluations of the Moon's age provide an additional constraint on the validity of accretion simulations.
